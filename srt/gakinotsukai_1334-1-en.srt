00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:03,220
First Time Ever on Gaki no Tsukai ... Chi....

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:03,220
Huh?

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:06,600
Sorry, please try again

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,380
First Time On Gaki No Tsukai Ya Arrahende CHIKI CHIKI

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,220
I Understand Him-

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,820
I can't even laugh at this

7
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,890
Even though he might be faking it

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,710
It's not funny at all

9
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,840
Did your wife find this act funny?

10
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,760
What is this?

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,160
What happened?

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,550
I lost my voice 2 days ago

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,130
I'm trying my best here

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,760
Are you gonna be alright?

15
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,730
I should?

16
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,730
You do it

17
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:36,800
Tanaka should do it

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,650
OK

19
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,650
Tanaka?

20
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,760
First Eve-

21
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,490
Make a joke here! (Do it wrong on purpose)

22
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,560
Prime opportunity!

23
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,090
That was your chance!

24
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:48,870
I apologise

25
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:48,870
You took it too seriously

26
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,980
Endo you do it

27
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,980
I didn't realise

28
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,820
First Ever Gaki No Tsukai CHIKI CHIKI

29
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,190
I Understand Him The Most,

30
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,180
Regardless, This Item Will Suit You Competition,

31
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,910
Suzuki Fuku-kun Edition

32
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:12,690
"In this program, the members will present clothing the guests might like"

33
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,270
You guys uhhh

34
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,240
Tanaka and Hamada should be good at this

35
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,780
Yes

36
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,300
Yes exactly

37
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,300
You two have adolescent sons

38
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,310
Mine's only 4 still

39
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,020
They wear what you buy them right?

40
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,020
Yes exactly

41
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,240
For me it's like,

42
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,330
boy children's clothes, I like,

43
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:28,040
don't even look at them (he has a daughter)

44
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,870
I've never bought them either

45
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,470
So I think I'm gonna suck at this

46
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,070
But I've already bought them so...

47
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,110
You're good at this segment usually

48
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,110
He is yeah

49
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:45,870
"With that said, our guest is this charasmatic child actor!"

50
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:52,460
"Will the members be able to buy clothes that suit this 12 year old?

51
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,670
OK, Fuku-kun, come on out!

52
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:10,000
He was this tall in that drama right? (Marumo no Okite)

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,420
Now he's this tall

54
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,400
I suppose so

55
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,400
You're getting your physicals done right?

56
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,600
He's 12 years old!

57
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,600
You should be getting them done

58
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,360
How old were you during Marumo No Okite?

59
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,700
I was like 6 ... wait no

60
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,870
You were 6!

61
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,310
6 years old right?

62
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,200
He was 6 years old

63
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,000
I was 6, 6 years old

64
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,560
Do you have any fashion preferences?

65
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,820
Do you care about fashion?

66
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,620
If you ask me if I care or not ...

67
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,560
I don't, I guess

68
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,290
You don't?!

69
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,220
Don't care?

70
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,200
Recently,

71
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,200
Well he is a boy,

72
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,580
Recently, I've been choosing what to wear to school

73
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,040
Oh by yourself?

74
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:08,040
"Before this shooting, the members went to buy a top and a unique item for the guest"

75
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,960
He has the cute-kid look to him right?

76
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,930
But that's not gonna be his image forever right?

77
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,600
Graduate from the cute-kid look,

78
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,240
to the cool-kid look

79
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,600
That's my opinion anyways

80
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,400
This kinda stuff is no good for a middle-schooler

81
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,600
We could wear it though

82
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,430
"Hamada enters this store too find a unique item"

83
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,960
Something like this is good

84
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,160
I wonder if they have a smaller size

85
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,960
I think this would be cute for a kid to wear

86
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,360
Although being cool is better

87
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,050
Staff: If it was a smaller size it would look different

88
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,890
This kind of thing is good, see?

89
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,650
Right?

90
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,510
That's nice, that's good

91
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,600
Staff: What image do you have of him?

92
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,000
Fuku-kun is, umm

93
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,180
not really, how do I say this,

94
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,800
not concerned with fashion

95
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,840
He's more interdedted in his youth

96
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,440
Interested?

97
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,640
Oh, that's nice, this is nice!

98
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,000
This is good

99
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,380
How much is this?

100
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,330
Expensive!

101
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,730
17,000 yen (~$170)

102
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,640
That will hurt if I lose

103
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:42,000
I really want to win Fuku-kun over

104
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,470
We have smaller ones with this design

105
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,440
You can match the vibe of your model

106
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,000
This kind...

107
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,870
What about this kind?

108
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,780
It's sort of ...

109
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,090
It's not right for Fuku-kun

110
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,120
I think giving high quality sunglasses as a present,

111
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,980
will make a fantastic present

112
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,600
I see, I see

113
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,290
"Will he find the perfect sunglasses for Fuku-kun?"

114
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:18,400
He's a middle schooler, so something slightly more mature

115
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,690
Suzuki Fuku-kun ....

116
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,000
Will probably suit him

117
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,870
But I need to take a risk here

118
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,440
I can't just play it safe

119
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,640
This is pretty fashionable right?

120
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,270
This is good!

121
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,270
This is good

122
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,840
This is really good

123
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,930
I will get this for him

124
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:52,500
"Matsumoto walked the most while searching for his gift"

125
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,110
Junior...

126
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,440
"He's having trouble finding an item that suits the image"

127
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,760
This is difficult

128
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:17,640
"Matsumoto continues to search the mall"

129
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,730
"Did he find a suitable item?"

130
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:30,470
"Like always, Fuku-kun can take home his favourite item. The person who bought the worst present must pay for it himself!"

131
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,290
Time to present a top that Fuku-kun might like!

132
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,470
Was anyone unsure of their choice?

133
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,580
I think I got something good

134
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,820
Can I go first?

135
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,380
Go ahead Yama-chan

136
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,450
A different order than usual

137
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,450
OK here I go

138
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,530
OK, Fuku-kuuun

139
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,130
You rotting storyteller (Rakugoka)

140
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,400
Who the hell is rotting?

141
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,070
Cause he's balding

142
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,490
Who the hell is balding?

143
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,110
Don't say that with your voice

144
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,270
Here you go Fuku-kun

145
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,040
Thank you very much

146
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,420
You'll definitely like this

147
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,710
Fuku-kun, please take a look inside

148
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,160
Wow it's like, really cute

149
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,110
he said cute right?

150
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,270
This is cute right?

151
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,730
That's really sticking out

152
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,240
It's kinda...

153
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,240
Well for us its,

154
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,180
We're not so sure about this

155
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:16,980
It's fun!

156
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,190
Fun?

157
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,190
It's fun right?

158
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,340
Is that like a pocket or something on the front?

159
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:22,820
Maybe it's fashionable?

160
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,790
It's fashionable right?

161
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,890
That's not a pocket or anything

162
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:29,170
It's just there as the tongue

163
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,420
It feels like something you pick for someone you hate

164
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,330
It doesn't feel like that!

165
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,110
It does

166
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,810
It does

167
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,620
It doesn't, right?

168
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,930
It feels like we started off negatively

169
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,510
Fuku-kun could you try that on?

170
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,520
"Next, the top Tanaka chose"

171
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,290
I asked my children for advice,

172
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:54,090
My two sons helped me out

173
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,290
Oh really?

174
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:57,220
They are in 1st and 6th year of school

175
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,460
I think they understand what Fuku-kun would like

176
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,640
And you guys buy clothes normally right?

177
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,640
Yes exactly

178
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,000
That's cheating! I don't know about this!

179
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,220
You're such a goddamn cheater!

180
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,690
That's not cheating!

181
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,070
Biggest cheater in Yoshimoto!

182
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,490
Give it to him already!

183
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,200
Yes of course sorry

184
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,580
This is cool!

185
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,530
The size is kinda big

186
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:29,130
Did you hear that? He said it's cool

187
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:33,560
I see, something for Fuku-kun to grow into

188
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,530
Try it on, try it on

189
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,840
It's a bit big

190
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,470
The size is important right?

191
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,470
Yes

192
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:41,070
I don't like the loose fit

193
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:47,240
This colour preserves some of the childlike cuteness

194
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,600
Turn around Fuku-kun

195
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,560
Show us the back please

196
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,270
There's nothing on the back

197
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,160
Yeah there's nothing

198
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,070
But ...

199
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,330
It doesn't suit him!

200
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,640
It does! It does

201
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,990
It says "Suit You"

202
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,990
Cause it says that

203
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,870
He looks like a Kansai Electric Railway worker

204
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,730
He does right?

205
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:12,560
I thought Fuku-kun might need something "wild"

206
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:29,550
"Third is Hamada? Just what will he present?"

207
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,640
This is similar to Tanaka's

208
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,110
Oh, OK

209
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,890
Cause he's in middle school

210
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,960
A bit of a mature Fuku-kun

211
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,160
In a way,

212
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,160
Yes exactly

213
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,800
Something similiar to my style

214
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,160
Something like your style

215
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,160
What does that mean?

216
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,220
Don't think that would suit him

217
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,850
Woah what's this?

218
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,840
I see

219
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,560
Cool!

220
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,200
I see, it is similar to Tanaka's

221
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,110
Yes, yes

222
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:57,110
They have those ones that say "Fuku" right?

223
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,470
Oh yeah

224
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:00,440
I wish he got one of those. This is kinda ...

225
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,020
Yeah but like,

226
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,730
This has that grown up look

227
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,530
There were cuter designs than this

228
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,800
I kinda don't want Fuku-kun to wear this

229
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,730
Why the hell not?

230
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,530
It doesn't suit him

231
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,760
It does!

232
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,490
That's supposed to be today's theme

233
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,330
That's no good, no good

234
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,910
You don't need to wear it so formally, you can like do this

235
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,740
A little looser

236
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,490
That kind of style

237
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,440
That's so Hamada!

238
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:27,400
You should walk like this, yeah exactly

239
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,240
If you walk like that they'll, steal your lunch money!

240
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,780
If you wear it like this it looks cooler

241
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,120
I guess so

242
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,140
Wear it like this in Summer

243
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:42,660
"Next up, Matsumoto's top presentation"

244
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,420
I sort of,

245
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,040
That's a childish bag

246
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:47,000
We had a more mature image right?

247
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,730
Fuku-kun doesn't want that sort of thing-

248
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,690
What is that?

249
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,270
What is that? (x 2)

250
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,070
It's a funny T-shirt

251
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,400
It's funny!

252
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,980
This is honestly,

253
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,690
so lame!

254
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,270
Don't say that sort of thing!

255
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,980
This is embarassing right?

256
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,960
This is embarassing

257
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,730
My 4 year old son has the same thing

258
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,360
It's so good!

259
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,640
So tight!

260
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,470
It's so nice!

261
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,240
Fuku-kun you're allowed to get angry!

262
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,960
C'mon try putting your hands in your pockets, that's the best part

263
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,890
But he doesn't actually have any!

264
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,930
Yeah that's what the funny part is, everyone will laugh

265
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,090
"Yeah I guess - OH SHIT" you will say

266
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,000
This makes you laugh

267
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,490
It's decided then, right?

268
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,960
Yup

269
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,980
He has the worst gift

270
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,020
He actually likes it though

271
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,400
What do you mean he likes it?

272
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,710
We don't know yet

273
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,880
We don't know yet

274
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:43,220
"Finally, Endo's top presentation"

275
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,760
Fuku-kun loves baseball,

276
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,160
The Hiroshima Carps in particular, right?

277
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,070
Using that information is cheating

278
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,800
I knew that already

279
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,600
Red!

280
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,090
Yes

281
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,360
Hell is that?

282
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,360
You're kiddng right?

283
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,820
An entertainer? (TV hosts wear this kind of jacket)

284
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,840
This suits him right?

285
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,690
It's like that show

286
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,530
Scary scary, I'm trembling

287
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,040
Endo this is terrible!

288
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,670
Just try it, try it on

289
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,560
The Hiroshima Carps, right?

290
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,180
This is a bit too...

291
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,360
Yamagami Brothers! (comedy duo)

292
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,280
It's that Tejinani thing! (same duo)

293
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,280
It isn't!

294
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,640
He's an Asakusa person (red light district)

295
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,890
Not at all!

296
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,510
A night club host

297
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,470
It's kinda,

298
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:24,710
It's something to wear with this kinda shirt

299
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,980
Yeah it's a more formal loo-

300
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,730
But that aside,

301
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,270
look at his sleeves!

302
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,070
Yeah look at his sleeves

303
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,580
You'll get bullied if you stick your arms up!

304
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,780
Those sleeves man...

305
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,530
I guess he'll just be choosing from these ones

306
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:41,640
No no, just pick the one you like

307
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,000
OK

308
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,000
Your favourite one

309
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,380
He needs a bowtie

310
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:50,350
"Which of these is his favourite top?"

311
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,070
Fuku-kun, listen,

312
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,360
This is more depressing than you'd think

313
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,040
Exactly, exactly

314
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,870
For us

315
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,440
That can't be helped

316
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,960
Cause we put in genuine effort

317
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,200
With that said, here we go

318
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,700
Which is your favourite?

319
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,420
The one you're taking home

320
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,600
Which one are you taking home?

321
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,840
This one

322
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,510
Of course!

323
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,160
Of course

324
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,180
Black and gold,

325
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,560
I like this black and gold colour

326
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,720
I see, the colour was good

327
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,200
Well I had a feeling I wouldn't be 1st

328
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,820
I kinda had that feeling

329
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,730
Who is in 2nd place?

330
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,510
This one

331
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,510
Obviously!

332
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,890
Yeah, that makes sense

333
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,530
These two both have sons

334
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,950
They're similar in age

335
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,690
Fuku-kun you liked that one?

336
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,040
Yes,

337
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:57,290
Something to wear when I'm hanging out with friends or family

338
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,380
This is the best for that right?

339
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:04,400
OK Fuku-kun, there are three left

340
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,510
The 3rd place

341
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:10,760
Who is 3rd?

342
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,210
That was close!

343
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,270
Last place is...

344
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,240
I really don't wanna be last

345
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:25,550
"Which is his least favourite top?"

346
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,440
Fuku-kun,

347
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,180
Last place is either one

348
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,760
Do you understand my position in the entertainment industry?

349
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,000
There he goes again

350
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,360
Don't say that!

351
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm a pretty important person

352
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,730
With that said, last place is ...

353
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,930
"With that said"?

354
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,470
I really don't wanna be last

355
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,240
Go ahead

356
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,330
That makes sense right?

357
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,910
That is garbage

358
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,600
I don't get it what did I do wrong?

359
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,200
Please tell us why it sucks

360
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:01,040
I like the Carps, and the colour red, but

361
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,470
It's just,

362
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,580
OK to be honest

363
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,820
It's pretty uncool

364
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,620
The colour and design suck too right?

365
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,870
It's sort of ...

366
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:16,800
"Endo must pay 4,999 yen of his own money! (~$50)

367
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:21,020
Time to present a unique item that suits Fuku-kun

368
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:28,110
"What unique item did Hamada pick out for Fuku-kun?"

369
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,290
OK I guess I'll ...

370
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:30,710
Please go ahead

371
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,450
That's huge!

372
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,530
That bag is kinda scary

373
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,710
That size is kinda-

374
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,560
It's something illegal

375
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,640
Who cares about the bag!

376
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,330
It's what inside

377
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,620
Woah what's that?

378
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,510
Thank you very much

379
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,730
This guy's such a cheater!

380
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,840
That's cheating man!

381
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,180
Fuku-kun stop that elated smile!

382
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,730
You're such a cheater man!

383
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,400
It's like he saw Santa Claus!

384
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,780
That's no good man, that's cheating

385
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,270
This is great for a middle schooler,

386
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,710
He's an actor after all

387
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,350
If he can buy that then,

388
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,020
I should've bought a PS4!

389
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,390
Exactly!

390
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:21,440
If you can't fit them now, you will grow into them later

391
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,560
It will be perfect

392
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:23,890
They're pefect!

393
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,490
They're perfect?

394
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,090
Perfect?

395
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,270
See?

396
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,360
Super cooooool!

397
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:37,710
"Next up is Tanaka, after the top, will he be able to win him over?"

398
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:42,330
I got the vibe that Hamada-san was going for

399
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,020
So just like with that jacket?

400
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,040
Yes exactly

401
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,390
So with that in mind, Fuku-kun please take this

402
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:52,090
He is a father to sons ....

403
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,200
What is it?

404
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,200
What's that?

405
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,930
Ah that sort of thing

406
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,960
Yes they're sunglasses

407
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,870
Not sure about this

408
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,870
Not sure about this

409
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,730
Oh that's no good!

410
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,020
What's with that?

411
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,730
I hate this boy!

412
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:07,560
I tried to get a size for kids of course

413
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,450
But like he said earlier,

414
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:13,850
Fuku-kun is sort of between the teenage and child look so,

415
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,850
So this colour is a bit cuter

416
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,360
No that's-

417
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,820
That's no good

418
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,980
It's like C-C-B (80's band)

419
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,420
Yeah it looks like CCB

420
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,160
No, no, no

421
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:30,710
"Next up, Matsumoto's unique item presentation"

422
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,000
Fuku-kun to me is more uhhh

423
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,410
a more fun kid

424
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,270
So I don't want you guys to give him that more mature look

425
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,490
Yeah but he's in middle sch-

426
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,310
You're kidding right?

427
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,580
Amazing!

428
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,710
He's in middle school!

429
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:47,780
What happened?

430
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,800
Just what is this Matsumoto-san

431
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,640
He's in middle school!

432
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,490
What are you doing to Fuku-kun?!

433
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,780
Hold on, hold on!

434
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,710
Isn't it super adorable?!

435
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,160
No nono no no

436
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,490
Today's Matsumoto is in bad shape!

437
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,330
A shark! It's a shark!

438
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,360
What happened?

439
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,670
It's a shark!

440
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,540
You wanna hurry up and take that off right?

441
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,420
It's OK! Take it off!

442
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,560
Next up is Sadam Hussein's unique item

443
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:20,980
You guys have just been giving him things to wear on his head

444
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:24,110
That's not right, what he need most right now is this

445
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,870
I wonder what it is

446
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,660
"I wonder what" he says

447
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,130
Rhino

448
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,130
Rhino

449
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,090
I'm gonna be sick

450
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,130
It's so realistic

451
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,400
That is sickening!

452
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,670
A decapitated head!

453
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,220
A rhino's decapitated head!

454
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,290
This does not suit him!

455
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,440
No need to vomit

456
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,780
It's rotting isn't it?

457
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,490
A decapitated head?

458
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,310
That looks super good Fuku-kun!

459
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,960
You'll become popular!

460
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,070
Where the hell did you find this?

461
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:57,090
You'll become so popular!

462
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:00,360
You seriously think he's gonna take that to school?

463
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,930
It's fun and trendy!

464
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,180
The mouth opens

465
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,560
Yes yes exactly

466
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,380
Well it does open but,

467
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,200
If you forget to close that everything will fall out!

468
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:19,340
"The guy who bought the worst top, Endo's item is next"

469
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,270
Just like Housei-san, I went for a bag

470
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:25,110
You're gonna go to middle school so,

471
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,180
I think a fashionable bag is something nice

472
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,130
Thank you

473
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:29,960
Open it please

474
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,590
A bag is difficult

475
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,670
I think this is good

476
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,760
It might turn out like the last thing

477
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,290
Woah what is this?

478
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,510
"What is this"...

479
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,670
He said "Woah what's this?"

480
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,180
What is that?

481
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,240
It's surprising right?

482
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,440
You just picked that out of the trash right?

483
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,890
The bag it came in is better

484
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,630
The packaging is better!

485
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,040
This one is better!

486
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,980
This one is better!

487
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,180
No this is better!

488
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,820
You just picked that up somewhere!

489
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,490
It's so raggedy!

490
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,870
This one is definitely better

491
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,730
No no no listen this one

492
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,640
It looks like a paper bag, it looks cheap but the inside-

493
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,730
You just said it looks cheap!

494
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,580
At first glance,

495
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,580
but the inside is well made

496
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,600
Isn't that a croquette wrapper?

497
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,240
No it isn't-

498
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,240
Those brown paper bags

499
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,330
For croquettes

500
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:14,250
That really is a croquette wrapper

501
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,870
It just looks like that!

502
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,290
So funny right Fuku-kun? A croquette wrapper!

503
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,420
A giant jumbo croquette wrapper, right?

504
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,160
So funny right?

505
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:35,150
"Which of these unqiue items is Fuku-kun's favourite?

506
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,150
Last place is between Matsumoto and Endo again

507
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,800
No no no I-

508
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,490
If you think about it, boys love animals

509
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,780
Boys love rhinos after all

510
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,600
Rhino?

511
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,160
Wait no!

512
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,730
Then it's gotta be Housei-san

513
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,820
OK Fuku-kun please stand behind the table

514
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:56,330
Which one is 1st place?

515
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,000
This one

516
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,640
Of course it is

517
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,780
So unfair

518
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,070
They're super cool!!

519
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,920
Right? They're so cool

520
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,270
Perfect for middle school

521
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,760
Is he your secret child or something?

522
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,240
Which one wins 2nd place?

523
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:32,040
Us two again

524
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,510
Another 1 - 2 for us

525
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:39,130
I guess after all, it's the guys who have raised boys who win

526
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,130
After all

527
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,420
Yes exactly

528
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,090
Our kids ask for this stuff

529
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:47,000
When they get a little older, right? Stuff like sneakers too

530
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,670
Yes, yes

531
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:51,090
We were at a disadvantage

532
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,070
So here we go,

533
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,040
Who is 3rd place?

534
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,270
This one

535
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,220
Oh that one?

536
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,000
Exactly Fuku-kun, thank you!

537
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,220
I don't wanna lose to this

538
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,870
It's interesting, and I like the realistic paper look

539
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:08,310
Well that one looks like a realistic rhino!

540
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,020
And this is a realistic shark!

541
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:20,090
"Housei's rhino bag, or Matsumoto's shark hat, which is worst?"

542
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:35,800
(skip to 22:35)

543
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:42,910
(recap)

544
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:46,110
I can get you blacklisted from lots of TV shows

545
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,160
Cut that out, Matsumoto-san

546
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,320
That's amazing

547
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,910
Fuku-kun, please select last place

548
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,760
Seroiusly?

549
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,760
Which one do you want the least?

550
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:01,980
Your least favourite

551
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:06,000
FUKU-KUUUUN!

552
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,240
You're joking, Fuku-kun!

553
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,200
FUKU KUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN!

554
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,200
Why is that last place?

555
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,780
It's kinda ...

556
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,640
Try it on again please

557
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,730
Seriously why is that the worst? I think it really suits him

558
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,380
The teeth ...

559
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,380
It looks so good on him!

560
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,380
Why is this last place?

561
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:30,490
It's too cute, right?

562
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,440
For a middle schooler, right?

563
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:32,440
It's kinda,

564
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,890
It's warm, which is good but,

565
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,240
It's warm

566
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,600
They'll make fun of you with that on, right?

567
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,600
Exactly

568
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,040
And there's no occasion to wear this

569
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,090
You're right

570
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,090
You're right

571
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:46,090
Maybe I should stab Fuku-kun?
