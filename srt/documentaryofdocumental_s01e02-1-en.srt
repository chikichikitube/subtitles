[Subbed by Thanos-no-Tsukai
Thanks For Watching!]

2
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,300
Actually, this time...

3
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:24,960
Yeah?

4
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,980
The one that shouldn't have existed.

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:28,440
Right.

6
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,740
We've decided to call it Season 0.

7
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:31,770
Right.

8
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,600
Well, an experiment can also
be experimental-

9
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:34,810
An experiment can also
be experimental.

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:35,340
I agree.

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:43,900
World Premiere
The Phantom Pilot Episode

12
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,140
What's really sticking out to me...

13
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,110
Trendy Angel's Saito

14
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,260
As soon as things got started,

15
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,860
screamed, "Peh!"

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,990
There's no way something
like that would happen

17
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,140
and so,

18
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,520
this is,

19
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,640
They'll say "That's it"!

20
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,660
Right, yeah.

21
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,430
Normally, anyone would laugh
at someone saying "Peh!" on TV

22
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,310
But you know, that seemed like
the beginning to Documental.

23
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,340
That's how I felt.

24
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,430
Yeah.

25
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,320
Whoa, whoa, what is this? (Editor's Note: 1)

26
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,000
This is crazy, whoa.

27
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,430
Seriously, wow.

28
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,240
There's no one here?

29
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,010
This is really, kind of foreboding.

30
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,030
[In Season Zero, no one is allowed
to bring any props with them.]

31
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,060
Wait a second, what is this?

32
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,720
Huh?

33
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,250
Well, I might as well sit down.

34
00:01:58,990 --> 00:01:59,370
Jiro? (EN: 2)

35
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,600
It's you, huh.

36
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,580
What?

37
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,310
I thought you'd be here.

38
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,040
Seriously?

39
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,240
You're here too?

40
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,830
I had a feeling you'd be here.

41
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,700
There's no way I could have known that.

42
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,530
Hey. (EN: 3)

43
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:20,730
Hello.

44
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:21,830
Wow

45
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,330
I get it now. This isn't a coincidence, is it.

46
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,220
Since Uchima is here too.

47
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:28,780
Are you nervous?

48
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,070
I'm not usually the funny one.

49
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,690
I've never been either.

50
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,500
I'm starting to realize that.

51
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,400
Something amazing just appeared. (EN: 4)

52
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,970
From the female contenders.

53
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,070
Where should I sit?

54
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,330
I have no idea.

55
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,510
This sucks.

56
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,620
An extremely clean envelope.

57
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,060
You brought that?

58
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,140
Yeah, I did.

59
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,810
They asked us to.

60
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,080
Because this is serious.

61
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,110
You brought something?

62
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,200
They're clothes. I changed my clothes.

63
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:12,780
Yeah.

64
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,270
You brought a change of clothes?

65
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,290
Basically, yeah.

66
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,330
If I got sweaty-

67
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,960
I don't think it's going to go that long.

68
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,580
I'm sure everyone will laugh
pretty quickly.

69
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,030
I wonder, I'm not too sure.

70
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,050
It's not me.

71
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:24,960
That wasn't really-

72
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,540
Something amazing just appeared. (EN: 5)

73
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,020
Wow.

74
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,360
Wow.

75
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,470
Wow.

76
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:35,370
Is this real?

77
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,120
Good morning.

78
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:36,920
Good morning.

79
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,260
Good morning.

80
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,770
Seriously...

81
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,390
Seriously...

82
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,400
What is he trying to say?

83
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,030
When he keeps saying "Seriously".

84
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,610
Your hair is a bit short isn't it?

85
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,280
Your hair is a bit-

86
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,300
Why'd you cut it?

87
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,170
Since I last saw you,

88
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,680
It's gotten way shorter than before.

89
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,250
Someone crazy could show up any second.

90
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:56,790
I want to see that.

91
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,060
It's happened again. (EN: 6)

92
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:06,920
another old man has appeared.

93
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,070
Good morning!

94
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,920
This is different.

95
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,590
Going by what I see,

96
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,300
I'm at a disadvantage.

97
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,530
Going by what you see?

98
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,390
His face looks pretty tough.

99
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,080
It does look tough.

100
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,230
Going by what you see.

101
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,270
Good morning. (EN: 7)

102
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,060
Good morning.

103
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,220
Another plain one has shown up.

104
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,410
Did you bring one million yen?

105
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,120
What?

106
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,140
Do you have the one million yen?

107
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,250
I barely got it together.

108
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,140
He's always... up to something.

109
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,290
Personally, I think Kiyoto is
the one to watch out for.

110
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,660
Wow. (EN: 8)

111
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,280
This is really..

112
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:51,920
Seriously.

113
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,340
Starting to take off.

114
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:55,230
Good morning.

115
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,770
Good morning

116
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,810
Good morning.

117
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,630
The worst guy (most dangerous) showed up.

118
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,100
The worst guy has shown up.

119
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,540
This isn't good.

120
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,490
I can't do this.

121
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,080
Did you bring it with you?

122
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:05,740
Do you have it?

123
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,530
One million yen.

124
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,240
Yeah, I have it.

125
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,940
It's dirty money, though.

126
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:09,700
Dirty money?

127
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,050
Yeah.

128
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,510
It's really dirty.

129
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,490
What is that?

130
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,730
You can't bring that here.

131
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,240
That's disgusting.

132
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,530
Morning! (EN: 9)

133
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,230
Huh?

134
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,200
Is this real?

135
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,220
Good morning!

136
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,950
Morning.

137
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:30,600
I'm Onigiri.

138
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,680
Right, right.

139
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,430
I'm getting nervous.

140
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,040
Are you nervous?

141
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,270
I am-

142
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:34,850
The one million.

143
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,120
Did you have one million yen?

144
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,560
You had it?

145
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,590
No, No.

146
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:38,830
I had to work for it.

147
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,790
I worked 18 hours straight.

148
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,630
I came straight from work.

149
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,210
I've got one million and five thousand
yen in cash right now.

150
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,600
After this, I'm only going to have 5000 Yen left
for the month.

151
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,590
You'll have to get a second job.

152
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,860
Wow. (EN: 10)

153
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,280
Seriously.

154
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,170
Good morning

155
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,050
This definitely isn't good.

156
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,620
Ah, I see.

157
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,990
And he's dressed so fashionably too.

158
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,540
This isn't good.

159
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,460
Why is he dressed so nicely?

160
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,400
Are you a comedian?

161
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:17,890
I don't think he is.

162
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,920
I think this is our first time meeting.

163
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,740
This is my first time.

164
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,220
It's nice to meet you.

165
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,340
It's nice to meet you.

166
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,470
As for being a performer,

167
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,100
Well, I used to play baseball
a long time ago.

168
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,830
But..

169
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,470
I can't.

170
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,500
Why are you laughing?

171
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,070
This isn't good.

172
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,450
Have you retired now?

173
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,780
I don't really get it but-

174
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,800
Good morning!

175
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:53,410
Good morning

176
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,110
Good morning.

177
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,840
Um..

178
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:57,860
One million yen.

179
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,210
Right.

180
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:01,190
Did everyone bring it?

181
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,100
One million Yen, everyone-

182
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,680
I brought it.

183
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,740
Yes.

184
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,150
Two hours before I left the house.

185
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,310
How did you get it together?

186
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,460
Um, Yoshimoto Finance

187
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,270
declined to help this morning.

188
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,290
Okay.

189
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,530
It's from my wife's younger sister and brother.

190
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,040
and my brother, who I don't even speak to.

191
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,490
Yeah.

192
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,240
Don't tell us anymore.

193
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:22,770
They gave it to me.

194
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,760
I got it. Thank you.

195
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,010
Yeah.

196
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,180
I'll start,

197
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,280
by going over the rules.

198
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:27,570
Okay.

199
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,640
Um..

200
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,800
What we want you to do today.

201
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,400
Yes.

202
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,190
It's very simple.

203
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,180
(1) Your time is unlimited

204
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,420
(2) Anyone who laughs will be asked to leave.

205
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:41,470
Okay.

206
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,200
(3) Those who have made it to the end
without laughing..

207
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,530
will be awarded 10 million yen.

208
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,020
You can do whatever you like,
there is nothing that is prohibited.

209
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,920
There are no time limits?

210
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,710
No time limits.

211
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:52,680
Forever?

212
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:53,360
Forever.

213
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:53,880
Until it's finished, right.

214
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,730
Until it's finished.

215
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,940
Not to be rude, but

216
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,280
If I look over there,

217
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,070
He has such a kind face,

218
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,360
so you can tell if he's laughing.

219
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,240
But me,

220
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,300
can a face like this laugh?

221
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,020
Well..

222
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,990
If you look at me...

223
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,610
I'll be the one who judges if
someone is laughing.

224
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:12,310
You'll be the judge?

225
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:12,950
Yes.

226
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:16,650
You’ll be able to look at our face
and tell who is laughing or not?

227
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:17,770
Well, yeah.

228
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,800
Well, obviously I can tell one of you
is an old man.

229
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,560
That's true.

230
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,540
As soon as he walked in,
he was holding his bag,

231
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,030
complaining like an old man.

232
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:32,260
Everyone please start gathering
the money together

233
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,640
and put it in the bag.

234
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,530
Pile it up, pile it.

235
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,240
That's crazy

236
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:44,910
Are you seeing this?

237
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,060
Wow!

238
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,780
Wow!

239
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,440
Whoa!

240
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:56,730
It's so tall.

241
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,120
Wow!

242
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,070
He's putting it all in a bag.

243
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,080
He's like the banker,
putting it in the bag.

244
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,480
Thanks for providing the money.

245
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,290
We have to work hard.

246
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,320
We have to work hard.

247
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,160
Well, everyone.

248
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,300
Do your best!

249
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:15,690
Okay!

250
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:16,540
Thank you!

251
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,000
Scary, scary, scary!

252
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,840
This is getting scary.

253
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,030
Not good.

254
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Calm down.

255
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,540
Documental

256
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,940
Start!

257
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,900
Peh peh peh!

258
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,780
Bando, did you come from the barber?

259
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:00,540
I just,

260
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,760
I just got a haircut.

261
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,490
Right, I went to the barber too.

262
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,210
Do you know whose haircut I asked for?

263
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,750
Who?

264
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,260
Kuwata Masumi. (EN: 11)

265
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,660
Now that you say something,
it does look like him.

266
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,790
It's the sides, I think.

267
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,090
You've got a stronger face, I think.

268
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,400
Really? But I'm talking about
hair right now.

269
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,670
Well, your entire face is like that so.

270
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,960
Well, they couldn't fix
my face at the barber.

271
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,480
This really isn't good.

272
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,960
Alright, alright, alright.

273
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,470
I can't, I can't.

274
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,560
If we drink, what happens?

275
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,680
Well, it's the timing isn't it?

276
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,770
This is going to be difficult.

277
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,840
I might get tired.

278
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,980
Where do they sell this?

279
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,420
Guam.

280
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,440
Yeah.

281
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,140
Guam? You went for work?

282
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,590
Yeah..

283
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:50,970
That sounds nice.

284
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,950
Everyone dresses like me there?

285
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,760
No, not really.

286
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,290
Anyway..

287
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,990
Really, what is happening here?

288
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,440
What is happening here?!

289
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,890
Please don't get so angry.

290
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,010
Yeah, we just got started.

291
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,610
What is happening?!

292
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,820
Isn't this weird?!

293
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,590
What in the world is
happening here?!

294
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,900
He's lost it. He's lost it.

295
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,320
This makes no sense!

296
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,730
They're really going to laugh!

297
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,100
Let me out!

298
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,680
Someone let us out of here!

299
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,790
What's wrong?

300
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,960
Let us out of here!

301
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,400
Calm down.

302
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,940
Someone is suspicious.

303
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,280
What happened?

304
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,120
What?

305
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,770
Hm?

306
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,080
That was really fast.

307
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,470
What?

308
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,400
What?

309
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,460
You're allowed to laugh now.

310
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,090
Who was it?

311
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,110
Did someone?

312
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,570
That was so quick.

313
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,000
What happened?

314
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,830
Oshima, yellow card.

315
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,060
Really?

316
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,440
Wait, wait, seriously?

317
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:10,880
Let me out!

318
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,280
Let us out of here!

319
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,590
What's wrong?

320
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,330
Let us out of here!

321
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,530
There it is!

322
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,560
There it is!

323
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,980
I was scared! It was scary!

324
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,290
You can't do that, you can't.

325
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,590
If the evidence was there.

326
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,980
You guys are way way too strict.

327
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,030
This is bad! I'm a bit hurt.

328
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,760
What were you doing?

329
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,110
Oh no, oh no..

330
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,850
Oh no, oh no!

331
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,290
Oh no!

332
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,740
What were you doing?

333
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,040
The cameras are amazing.

334
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:43,600
Really?

335
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,480
So is our Emperor.

336
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,120
You can see everyone reflected
in the window glass.

337
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,420
Oh wow, you can.

338
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,600
You can see everyone.

339
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,620
Everyone?

340
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,800
If I look behind, I'll laugh.

341
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,290
Scary.

342
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,360
I can't go back now.

343
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,230
To what I was saying.

344
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,730
How many windows are there?

345
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,370
Saito, you look terrible.

346
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,740
But he can come out as leader.

347
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,360
Why are you coming over here?

348
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,690
Why are you coming over here!?

349
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,890
Why do you keep following me?!

350
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,090
Huh?

351
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:42,480
You came over here and then you!

352
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,130
Huh?

353
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:48,130
You guys are definitely working together!

354
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,080
That's enough!

355
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:10,040
As soon as we started, this business
has gotten scary!

356
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,980
I'm not holding anything, I'm just a woman!

357
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,420
There's nothing going on, calm down!

358
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:16,900
It's okay.

359
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:17,930
I'm scared!

360
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,990
I'm scared!

361
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,140
Stop doing that.

362
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,080
There are beds here too! I'm so scared!

363
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,700
We're no where near the beds.

364
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,070
You guys are planning to
try something, aren't you?!

365
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,080
It's not like that.

366
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,840
You guys are definitely planning
to do something to me here.

367
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,800
As a woman, you're absolutely safe.

368
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,210
I'm scared of you the most!

369
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,260
Me?!

370
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,990
I'm way too old for that!

371
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,620
You still look like you've got some energy.

372
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,640
That's not true!

373
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,400
I'd need so much Viagra,
I'd have to go to the hospital!

374
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,460
Don't say that kind of thing in
front of a lady.

375
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,750
Sorry, sorry.

376
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,450
That's rude!

377
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,010
I'm just trying to comfort her.

378
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,090
Why would you say crazy things like
that to a woman?

379
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,140
That doesn't make sense.

380
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,340
What are you trying to say about Viagra?

381
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,520
I'm saying I take it, because I have no energy.

382
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,320
That's all I'm talking about.

383
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,590
Let's not talk about that
in front of women.

384
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,290
Okay, but you-

385
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:10,260
Let's stop acting so tough,
don't be so angry with me.

386
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,330
Okay, I'm sorry.

387
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,450
Right? Let's use our words.

388
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,520
We have so many performers here.

389
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:20,330
Does anyone have any one-liners
to make someone laugh?

390
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,260
One liners?

391
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,890
Saito, what's going on over there?

392
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,890
I can't tell if he's on the
offense or defense.

393
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,970
Bando, since entering Yoshimoto,

394
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,940
I'm sure you created some gags
or one-liners you could use?

395
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,150
Not, not at all.

396
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:38,020
I've just got some that I've
heard over the years.

397
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,990
Well, it's because I'm not a comedian.

398
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,930
Is the pay cheaper compared to us?

399
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,350
How much do you get paid?

400
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,240
Not that much. I never make
more than ten thousand Yen

401
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,280
Never more than that.

402
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,980
Less than ten thousand Yen?

403
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,670
If so, why not try something else?

404
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,010
Huh?

405
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,480
What?

406
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:58,650
You make more?

407
00:15:58,770 --> 00:15:59,770
Or less?

408
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,320
Me?

409
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:00,920
Yeah.

410
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,180
I think it's more than that.

411
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,370
Wow..

412
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,040
What type of comedy are you
doing right now?

413
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,190
Right now, I'm doing that
thing with Umemiya.

414
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,640
Right.

415
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,660
Where we imitate each other's body.

416
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,840
Can I show you?

417
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,960
Yeah.

418
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,370
Everyone is going to explode into laughter.

419
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,740
My body.. my body looks like his.

420
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,040
I don't have everything with me, so..

421
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,600
Ah, you didn't bring it with you.

422
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,130
So, I can't do it properly.

423
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,150
Right, right.

424
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,750
I'm usually not holding it.

425
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,950
Right, right.

426
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,020
Here I go.

427
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,860
I get it.

428
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,300
So you stand like that.

429
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,600
And you move around like that?

430
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,700
Yes.

431
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,660
Must be pretty tough.

432
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,310
Well, the point is our bodies
look pretty similar.

433
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,040
Ah, right, your body.

434
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,270
Is it because the look the same?

435
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,300
Oshima, what are you-

436
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,110
Oshima, you can't do that.

437
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,290
She's right on the line.

438
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:11,700
When this happens, I would
usually say something.

439
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,880
If there's anything you like, take it-

440
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:15,940
If it's you it's fine.

441
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:16,720
Really?

442
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,220
They said we could do whatever we liked.

443
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,970
I wonder how they collected
all of this stuff together.

444
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,810
Let's get a garage together.

445
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,300
- Right.

446
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:27,620
Somewhere to put stuff

447
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,780
It'll be our base.

448
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,020
You can take it-

449
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:35,180
Have you ever run to
a base like this before?

450
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:39,440
That's one of those American radios.

451
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,850
It'd be nice if someone could
make use of it again.

452
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,020
An-chan! (EN: 12)

453
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,310
An-chan, can you fix that posture?

454
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,880
Not that again.

455
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,260
Can you fix it, An-chan?

456
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:53,150
This old man runs to the base like that.

457
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,240
He always stands like that, right An-chan?

458
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,900
Well, everyone already knows this.

459
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,450
You're this huge thing, like when
your playing sports,

460
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,380
and then you suddenly shrink

461
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,860
It's crazy, I know.

462
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:05,890
I think Bando is..

463
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:06,660
It really is.

464
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:07,280
-Do you want a massage?

465
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:08,380
-I'm good, thanks.

466
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,360
He's trying so hard to hide it.

467
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,680
So impactful.

468
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,080
Right here

469
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,270
Look!

470
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,360
What do you want?!

471
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,840
What in the world.

472
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:20,950
What is that?

473
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,140
I know right?

474
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,520
I've got no idea

475
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:26,810
Huh?

476
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,060
What?

477
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,200
Who laughed, who laughed?

478
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:30,680
What?

479
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,700
What?

480
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,500
Akiyama

481
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,680
Seriously?

482
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:43,910
Yellow card.

483
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,310
I had no idea.

484
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,460
You showed up quicker
than I thought you would.

485
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,500
So impactful.

486
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,050
Probably right there.

487
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,090
Look!

488
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,080
What do you want?

489
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,180
That's out.

490
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,460
Also..

491
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,530
Bando, you always

492
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,180
looked like you were about to laugh.

493
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,370
When I was talking, I definitely
thought I laughed.

494
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,430
Yeah, you looked like you were laughing.

495
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,560
If that happens again,
it'll be a yellow card.

496
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,290
What?!

497
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,460
Go complain to my parents about it.

498
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,920
Your parents? No, we won't
tell your parents.

499
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:30,720
Your parents?

500
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:33,690
Man, I'm sitting down.

501
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,790
It's getting late.

502
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,660
There's so many ways to lose

503
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,210
Yeah, definitely.

504
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,310
You don't even realize it.

505
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,300
Start.

506
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,020
Are they warming up?

507
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,310
Not yet, I just turned it on.

508
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,570
You're cooking them?

509
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:52,190
Yes,

510
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:52,820
I'm cooking.

511
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,520
Is it okay?

512
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,140
Yeah.

513
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,260
Is it okay?

514
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,880
Are you okay?

515
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,940
Mayonnaise?

516
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,640
Sometimes, I do.

517
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Like that?

518
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:11,570
Thanks.

519
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,400
Thanks.

520
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,600
It's delicious.

521
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,760
They're hot!

522
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,580
These taste really good.

523
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,420
This is a different way of eating them.

524
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,140
It's delicious!

525
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,880
Instead of cracking them and eating them.

526
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,320
Does it make a difference?

527
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,490
The burners are electric, so there's that.

528
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:26,990
What?

529
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,580
The stove is electric, so it doesn't
heat as well.

530
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,200
Thanks for the food.

531
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,660
They're good.

532
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,520
Can I have some?

533
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,900
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

534
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,980
Can you crack them for me?

535
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,020
Whoa, whoa!

536
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,480
These are way too hot!

537
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,510
They're way too hot.

538
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,800
They're hot.

539
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,130
Who is it?

540
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,150
Who is it?

541
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,530
Now, I'm all tensed up.

542
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,630
This is terrifying.

543
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,900
I saw it.

544
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,500
Hachimitsu.

545
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:16,410
Huh?

546
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:16,810
What?

547
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,130
What?

548
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:17,630
Seriously?

549
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:18,780
You're giving me that?

550
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,100
You're laughing?

551
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,120
Right.

552
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:21,740
Yellow.

553
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,780
Got it.

554
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,790
Can you crack them for me?

555
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,640
Whoa, whoa!

556
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,530
These were way too hot!

557
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,750
Too hot!

558
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,940
He was absolutely laughing.

559
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,700
He was laughing with his entire face!

560
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:41,990
He was laughing!

561
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:42,920
What was it?

562
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:43,840
What made you laugh?

563
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,230
Of course, the food was hot.

564
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,280
He asked me to give him some.

565
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,190
Scooped them in his hand and-

566
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:48,510
They really were hot!

567
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,740
They were hot?

568
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,440
It was too funny.

569
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,080
It's those small things.

570
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:54,910
Right..

571
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,060
It was pretty funny.

572
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:00,520
Next time will obviously be a red card.

573
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:01,310
- Okay!

574
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:01,820
- Okay!

575
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,400
Okay.

576
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:03,520
Thank you.

577
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,340
Thank you.

578
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,440
Thank you.

579
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,260
This is hard.

580
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,490
Let's.. Let's clean up a bit.

581
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,510
Bando, do you know everyone's names?

582
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:21,030
No idea.

583
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:21,630
What?

584
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,960
Really?

585
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:24,830
So, you don't know him?

586
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,010
It's fine if you get it wrong.

587
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:26,890
No, no.

588
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,740
We were on Kanjani together. (EN: 13)

589
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,610
I remember that.

590
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,700
Kanjani?

591
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,440
We were on a TV program that-

592
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,340
It was for TV, right?

593
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,040
But, we haven't spoken
in a really long time.

594
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,240
Despite that, you don't know his name?

595
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,380
Names are a bit, you know..

596
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,560
Bando, it's not good to forget
people's names.

597
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,920
I mean, we're doing jobs
like this together.

598
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,180
You don't remember anyone's name?

599
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,240
Not one?

600
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:47,990
Really?

601
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:48,670
It's okay if you get it wrong.

602
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:49,410
It's okay to guess.

603
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,180
It's okay if you're wrong.

604
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,720
To be honest,

605
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,190
I'm pretty sure..

606
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,740
I've known him for over 15 years already.

607
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:56,930
What?

608
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,010
Seriously?

609
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,780
Chibata too, I think.

610
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,450
We even played baseball together.

611
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,090
What?!

612
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,620
A professional team?

613
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,080
No, we weren't on the same team.

614
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,650
He was on the opposite team.

615
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:10,190
Now that I think about it,
when I've heard you speak to others,

616
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,270
You usually just refer to everyone
by the title "you".

617
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,710
Really?

618
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:14,740
First of all-

619
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:15,330
Ah, sorry.

620
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,480
I have an excuse.

621
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,180
I have an excuse.

622
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,320
No matter how hard I try,
I can only remember the player numbers.

623
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,840
When I need to remember,

624
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,750
I look at each person and
write it down their numbers.

625
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,490
Should we all go around
and tell him our names?

626
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,400
Self introduction?

627
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:32,980
Sure.

628
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:33,570
Okay.

629
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,940
Everyone.

630
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,010
Let's do it.

631
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,080
I know everyone's names.

632
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:38,790
Huh?

633
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:39,550
What?

634
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,920
Everyone's name-

635
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,620
What, you do?

636
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:44,760
Wait, you know everyone?

637
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,060
I know everyone's names.

638
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:46,910
What?!

639
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,850
Try and say everyone's name.

640
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,510
Yeah, say our names.

641
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,830
That's Akiyama, right?

642
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:52,990
Yes.

643
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,100
Ah, looks like he remembers.

644
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,150
Then...

645
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,480
Umm..

646
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,030
That's Happou, right?

647
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,110
Huh, no?

648
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,200
I'm not.

649
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:02,890
He's Happou.

650
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:07,840
That's my dad.

651
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:08,930
Or your son?

652
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,120
Do you know his name?

653
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,600
Oda Mudo, right? (EN: 14)

654
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,980
No, I'm not.

655
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,080
Oda Mudo is someone else.

656
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,820
We might have the same haircut.

657
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:20,270
Oda Mudo is working in Roppongi,
he's not here right now.

658
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,210
Oh, really?

659
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,390
Yeah. He's making a lot of money.

660
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,550
You know a lot about Oda Mudo.

661
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,390
I think he's acting in a drama, right now.

662
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:31,590
That must be nice

663
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:32,270
That's what I just said.

664
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,840
He's working in Roppongi.

665
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:34,870
but living in Wasaki.

666
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,270
Right..

667
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,480
There's a lot to know.

668
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,230
Bando, what did you do
when things were tough?

669
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,880
I usually made my own food.

670
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,330
So I didn't leave the house
for a long time.

671
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,060
They called me a shut-in.

672
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,110
A shut-in?

673
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,620
Yeah, so I was always at home.

674
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,400
Wow..

675
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,240
When I hear that story,
I always start to cry.

676
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,780
What? Well yeah, it was tough.

677
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,810
But it was a really long time.

678
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,050
To the point where I dreamed
of going outside.

679
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,770
Wow..

680
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:07,810
I dreamed of going outside.

681
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,770
He really did his best, you know.

682
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,840
He did?

683
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,540
He was working so hard

684
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:15,570
When no one even knew.

685
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,920
He really....

686
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:20,240
You really never left your home, right?

687
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,330
I never left.

688
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,290
Is it okay if we hear it from him?

689
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:24,710
Right, sorry.

690
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:25,870
I had heard about it.

691
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,900
Ah, you knew about it?

692
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,490
It was really hard.

693
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,220
You understand me, right?

694
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,880
I saw you.

695
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,980
You saw him?

696
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,380
They made a TV show about it.

697
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,500
Whoa, they made a show about it?

698
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,500
Amazing.

699
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,940
Bando, isn't that called house arrest?

700
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:43,900
That's crazy.

701
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,910
No, it wasn't anything like that.

702
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,510
Maybe I made a mistake.

703
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,270
Who was that?

704
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,340
I might have been thinking of Ryotaro.

705
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,890
That's crazy if you can't tell
the difference between Ryotaro and I.

706
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,180
Ryotaro?

707
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,150
Who is Ryotaro?

708
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,140
Um.

709
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:00,090
Who?

710
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,920
Ryotaro?

711
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,380
Who in the world is that?

712
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,560
Was it non-fiction?

713
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,600
Ryotaro Blues?

714
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,940
Ryotaro Blues!

715
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,580
Ryotaro Blues.

716
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,300
That was 100%

717
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,640
That was definitely a laugh.

718
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:22,380
She shouted when she laughed.

719
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,990
If that's what you thought, I'm sorry!

720
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,170
She was just happy-

721
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,170
I was just so happy!

722
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,070
Oshima.

723
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,360
Yellow card.

724
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,470
Okay, you got me.

725
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:40,830
Which means!

726
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:41,220
Right.

727
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:41,970
You're out!

728
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,460
Wow!

729
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:52,770
It was, well, a laugh
from the heart, right?

730
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,290
You can leave happy!

731
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,940
I admit this one, yeah.

732
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:58,790
Who in the world is that?

733
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:01,360
Ryotaro?

734
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:02,240
Was it non-fiction?

735
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,610
Ryotaro Blues?

736
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,750
Ryotaro Blues!

737
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,420
Ryotaro Blues.

738
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,710
Even before that, it was pretty close.

739
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,950
Things like stuffing your mouth
full of bread.

740
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:14,860
I saw everything.

741
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,270
She's really stuffing it.

742
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,500
She was stuffing her mouth full of bread.

743
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:22,010
Stopping up the corners of her mouth
so we can't see her laughing.

744
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,370
Oshima, that's what you were doing?!

745
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,650
Were going to miss you, Oshima.

746
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:28,500
You're out!

747
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:29,810
Thank you! Excuse me.

748
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,700
Good luck.

749
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,880
That's all for now.

750
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:36,670
Right.

751
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,850
It's all for one million Yen..

752
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,160
One million yen..

753
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,290
Now we're in trouble.

754
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,560
We're getting close to winning
one million Yen.

755
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:46,590
Start.

756
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,640
Let's start a game.

757
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,100
A new game?

758
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:54,890
Something like Saito's game.

759
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:55,830
Saito is-

760
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,080
What is that?

761
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,480
Can you show us?

762
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,310
I want to play.

763
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:02,150
First, create a nickname using
the two syllables from your name.

764
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,580
For example, I'm Saito, so "Saito".

765
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,430
Kubo, so "Kubo".

766
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,290
So if it were me, then "Banden".

767
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,320
No, "boiled". (Yude)

768
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,110
"Boiled"?

769
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,770
"Boiled", right, okay.

770
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,330
Well once you pick the two syllables,

771
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,040
for example, if we were to start with me-

772
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,970
We, start, with Sai,

773
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,670
Match it, to, the rhythm.

774
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,380
First, both hands on the table.

775
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,270
One.

776
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,330
Two.

777
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,160
Right.

778
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:24,400
Right.

779
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,460
This is loud.

780
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:26,050
Then left.

781
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,550
The rhythm is those four beats.

782
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,120
One, two, three, start.

783
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:34,050
Match it, to, the rhythm.

784
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,680
Bam, bam, pe, pe.

785
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,720
Like that.

786
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,260
Bam, bam, pe, pe?

787
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:39,860
Bam, bam-

788
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:40,990
You do one right after the other?

789
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:41,560
Yeah, you do.

790
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,890
So there's at least four.

791
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:43,930
Ah, I get it.

792
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,690
If we lose should we create a punishment?

793
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,050
Yeah, why not.

794
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,430
We might as well.

795
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,980
How about this?

796
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,640
How about slapping our ass with these?

797
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:53,880
How about it?

798
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,910
As a punishment for losing.

799
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,440
We can try it and see how it goes.

800
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,150
Okay.

801
00:28:59,190 --> 00:28:59,710
One..Two..

802
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,510
The beat starts with Sai,

803
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,200
match it to the rhythm.

804
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,280
I choose Aki.

805
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
pe, pe.

806
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,040
I choose Sai.

807
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,040
pe, pe.

808
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,380
I choose Kubo.

809
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,310
pe, pe.

810
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,460
I choose "Boiled".

811
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,710
Ah, I messed up!

812
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:19,770
You got me.

813
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,510
That would be an out.

814
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,820
Let's do the punishment.

815
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:23,360
It's me?

816
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,530
That thing looks hard!

817
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,660
Well, it's just your butt.

818
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,520
Of course, just my butt.

819
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,440
I'll do it like this.

820
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:31,960
Okay, okay.

821
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:32,610
Here I go.

822
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,250
Here I go.

823
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,120
Oh, are you okay?

824
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:39,460
My butt hurts!

825
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:41,490
I'm sorry! I'm really sorry.

826
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,920
Say sorry to him.

827
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,880
I'm sorry.

828
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,650
I'm okay. Don't feel bad,
it's a punishment.

829
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,670
I'm sorry. Punishments have
to be like that. I have no choice.

830
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:50,690
I'm sorry.

831
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,350
The sound scared me the most.

832
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:55,470
Did it startle you?

833
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:58,250
I'll do it next, we'll take turns.

834
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,980
Let's start with Uchima, then.

835
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,820
Here I go.

836
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,140
The beat starts with Uchi

837
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,430
Match it to the rhythm.

838
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,950
I choose Kubo!

839
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,970
Pe, pe.

840
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,300
I choose Boiled

841
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,950
Wait, I'm still in the game?

842
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,570
No, it's fine.

843
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:16,560
Your rhythm was kind of off.

844
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,660
Uchima you were going too fast.

845
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,100
Bam, bam, I choose Kubo

846
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,140
You have to say it like that.

847
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,960
So who is out, then?

848
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:23,950
I think it's Uchi.

849
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:24,770
Uchi?

850
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,730
Uchi, you're out.

851
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,500
He's out.

852
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:28,950
It's because of his rhythm, right?

853
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,980
He didn't follow-

854
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,070
His rhythm was off, so he's out.

855
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:35,200
If you don't do it properly, your out.

856
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,470
So he's out then.

857
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:38,490
I got it! I'm out then.

858
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,470
This really is a part of the rules, right?

859
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,520
Yeah!

860
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,350
I don't think I can remember this.

861
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,270
That hurt.

862
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,530
You should put something damp on it later.

863
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,780
They got him completely.

864
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,180
I saw it too.

865
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,090
I thought maybe they missed it.

866
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,190
I didn't see it!

867
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,560
Me?

868
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,170
No, I don't know, but.

869
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:27,810
Bando.

870
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,600
Yellow card.

871
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:29,630
Really?

872
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,080
He said "Really?"!

873
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,420
He was completely laughing

874
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:34,540
Was I?

875
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:37,810
It was a completely normal laugh,
from an old man.

876
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:42,250
I want to see if I was really laughing!

877
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,960
Was I laughing?

878
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:46,990
This is different.

879
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,690
You were just laughing normally!

880
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,980
Next time will be a red card.

881
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,610
Wow, they really got me.

882
00:31:59,010 --> 00:31:59,980
You really were just laughing normally

883
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,430
That's his real face.

884
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:04,590
If you feel like showering, please do.

885
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,650
Ah, thank you.

886
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,350
They could see it.

887
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,760
That was really funny.

888
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:10,460
That was really..

889
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:11,970
Ha ha ha!

890
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:13,410
We're starting!

891
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:19,430
Bando, what time do you usually go to bed?

892
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,560
I usually sleep around 10.

893
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,760
Then I wake up around 6.

894
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,730
I go to sleep earlier.

895
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,190
Why do you go to bed so early?

896
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:27,800
I go to sleep around 8:30.

897
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,700
I'm usually in bed by now.

898
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:30,400
Really?

899
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,870
Wow, that's early.

900
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,100
You don't fall asleep again?

901
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,240
Well,

902
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:36,850
how do I explain it,

903
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,170
After the sun rises, I don't.

904
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:41,070
I always end up getting
tired in the afternoons.

905
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:44,830
But you look like you've
got so much energy.

906
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,170
No, that's definitely not true.

907
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:51,580
They says bad women are like piss stains.

908
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,750
You can't get rid of them, right?

909
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:55,770
Right..

910
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,880
Do you meet prostitutes?

911
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,000
No, I've never done that.

912
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:00,080
Speaking of prostitutes,

913
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,540
Women meet them too, I think.

914
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,320
They do.

915
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,910
They don't want anyone to know.

916
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,850
Right..

917
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,870
Do you know what I ask for?

918
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,410
I’ll get up and show you.

919
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,930
Let's pretend I'm thirsty.

920
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,390
You go like this.

921
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,920
Then it goes there.

922
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,470
That's it, you know?

923
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,550
That's what I like, anyway.

924
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:33,300
What type of entertainer is
Documental looking for?

925
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,700
As expected, well..

926
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:39,920
I'm looking for those who
will go on the attack and defense.

927
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,960
Right..

928
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,980
Of course, right?

929
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:45,070
If they don't attack,
then nothing will happen.

930
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:50,450
[Elapsed time 4 hours]

931
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:51,520
Okay.

932
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,190
Here I go.

933
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,480
Whoa..

934
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,450
That was amazing, just now.

935
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:05,240
Here I go.

936
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:05,900
Here I go!

937
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:06,500
Okay!

938
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:07,210
Okay!

939
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,630
Whoa...

940
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:13,530
You can't keep doing that!

941
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,380
Here I go. Third time is the real one.

942
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,540
It's coming.

943
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:20,270
I'm gonna aim for this area.

944
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:21,530
Okay?

945
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:21,980
Okay!

946
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:25,890
Whoa.

947
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,930
I can't do this anymore!

948
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:28,870
This is against the rules.

949
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,490
I really didn't hit him.

950
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:32,130
He didn't hit me,

951
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,030
But this is worse than getting hit!

952
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,500
You come over here.

953
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:37,930
You want to switch?

954
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:38,970
That's fine.

955
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,610
That's fine with me.

956
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:44,700
Here we go

957
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,720
Wait, that's already how many?

958
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,490
Come on.

959
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:00,130
You weren't scared?

960
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,260
I wasn't.

961
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,170
Go ahead.

962
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:06,760
Come on. Come on!

963
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,380
Come on!

964
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:08,650
What is that?

965
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:10,520
Come on!

966
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:17,680
There's no one here that isn't a performer.

967
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,760
[Eiji Bando's role in Season 0]

968
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:20,170
Well, Bando

969
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:23,070
Isn't really a comedian, is he?

970
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,550
He definitely acts like a performer.

971
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,420
Right!

972
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:28,510
There was that experience he told.

973
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,600
It was pretty funny.

974
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:34,610
Having him on the show and
messing around with him was really fun.

975
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:35,770
Absolutely.

976
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:38,520
You get a bit sentimental
thinking about it.

977
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:41,410
Ah, he took a shower.

978
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,250
Are you sure you wouldn't like
to take a shower?

979
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:47,730
No, I brought a change of clothes.

980
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:52,490
You brought pajamas?

981
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,580
No, just a change of clothes.

982
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,600
I didn't plan on sleeping here.

983
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:58,890
That's all.

984
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,500
Are they.. Well I saw this on Wikipedia..

985
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,270
Yes?

986
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,230
They have panties included inside.

987
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,130
Was it something else?

988
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,230
Panties?

989
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,180
Yeah, they have panties inside.

990
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,500
Basically, yeah, they have panties inside.

991
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,800
Women's panties.

992
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,910
They're supposed to have panties inside.

993
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,620
No way, absolutely not.

994
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:26,630
That's wrong, wrong, wrong.

995
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:27,800
Those are yours?

996
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:29,200
What is?

997
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,210
The ones with panties.

998
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,300
No, no these are-

999
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:34,110
I don't remember the store, but they're
regular men's underwear.

1000
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,690
They look really fashionable.

1001
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,370
Huh?

1002
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:36,930
They're fashionable.

1003
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:37,950
They are.

1004
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:39,460
Really?

1005
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,300
The giraffe print.

1006
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,430
They're just-

1007
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,320
If it was women's underwear,
there would be three giraffes.

1008
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,080
Here?

1009
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:10,750
Bando.

1010
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,030
You laughed normally again.

1011
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:18,960
I'm not saying anything.

1012
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:22,870
They got me again!

1013
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:24,570
You're out!

1014
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,820
What a shame.

1015
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:28,350
I even learned everyone's name-

1016
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,400
It's a shame, you came so far.

1017
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:30,950
Yeah!

1018
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:40,220
Could you, maybe look the other way?

1019
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,660
You can't?

1020
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,010
What are you talking about?

1021
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,050
I thought so.

1022
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,800
What a waste.

1023
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,670
I don't want to say that to you.

1024
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:52,240
Bando is going home. Thank you!

1025
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,320
Thank you! Man, I really messed up.

1026
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:55,370
Great job!

1027
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:56,390
Thank you!

1028
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,480
Good luck to the rest.

1029
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,560
We will! Thank you!

1030
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:02,190
I really messed up..

1031
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,270
8 are left.

1032
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:07,520
Right.

1033
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,180
Let's finish this.

1034
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,200
Okay!

1035
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:15,570
He left.

1036
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,110
Bando is gone now.

1037
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:20,250
We're starting.

1038
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,900
Well, now..

1039
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,770
Now that the oldest one, Bando, has left.

1040
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,660
Will something in them

1041
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:37,970
begin to change?

1042
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,610
We don't know, but it could.

1043
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:47,210
The atmosphere has definitely changed.

1044
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,410
What's wrong?

1045
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,330
Someone shut him up.

1046
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,140
Who is that?

1047
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:08,030
Wha- what's wrong?

1048
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,060
What is it?

1049
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,520
Peek a boo!

1050
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,240
Ah, he's started again.

1051
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:28,790
What are you doing?

1052
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:30,230
I feel bad for him.

1053
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:31,710
He's a crier, huh.

1054
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:38,650
Hello?

1055
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,750
Aki laughed, didn't he?

1056
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:44,330
Um.

1057
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:46,540
Akima, did you laugh just now?

1058
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:49,650
Just now, um..

1059
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:53,410
I was just trying to make someone laugh.

1060
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,250
Do you want to speak with him?

1061
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:56,430
Yeah, let me speak with him.

1062
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:00,830
Yes, hello?

1063
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,700
Um..

1064
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,160
Usually, that well,

1065
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:07,540
that would be against the rules.

1066
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,000
Right.

1067
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,450
That was pretty close.

1068
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,500
Yeah, you're right.

1069
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,900
When I was doing it, suddenly,

1070
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:13,460
I noticed it suddenly.

1071
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,320
I might look like I'm laughing.

1072
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,830
But it really was

1073
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:21,090
just a joke to make others laugh.

1074
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:23,670
It was close, really close.

1075
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,660
You were an inch from being axed.

1076
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,220
I'm sorry, I understand.

1077
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,900
I'll be more careful.

1078
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:34,030
That was a long talk.

1079
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,350
It was because I had laughed a little bit.

1080
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,090
So no matter what.

1081
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,190
I see.

1082
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,700
I've got to be careful in that area.

1083
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,850
It's hard to know if it's against
the rules or not.

1084
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:57,170
I'm about to change, will you watch?

1085
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:58,810
Sure.

1086
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,060
The briefs that I'm wearing right now,

1087
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,120
Yeah.

1088
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,700
I'll show you how I take them off.

1089
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,070
What?

1090
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,950
You're going to change?

1091
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:19,300
That's a good brand, Sophnet.

1092
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:25,590
Surprise!

1093
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,840
They came off pretty cleanly.

1094
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,280
They're not torn.

1095
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:33,530
What is this, an exhibition?

1096
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:35,820
How did he do that?

1097
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,990
It's an exhibition.

1098
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,280
Is there something attached?

1099
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,880
Can you lower your pants please?

1100
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:46,950
There's nothing there.

1101
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,020
He's right.

1102
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:49,730
The king has appeared.

1103
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:51,810
How did you do that?

1104
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,980
It's not torn, it's cut.

1105
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:56,820
You do that when you poop?

1106
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:58,490
Yeah, I do.

1107
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:01,850
When I poop, it pretty nice.

1108
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:07,840
But I can't carry a grocery bag.

1109
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:10,330
What in the world is he saying.

1110
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:20,400
It suddenly got really interesting

1111
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,900
and a lot started happening.

1112
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:24,330
Done.

1113
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,060
Huh?

1114
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,630
You're annoying!

1115
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:37,650
Get away!

1116
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,500
If you want me to stop, just say so.

1117
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,540
Go ahead.

1118
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:45,070
I think the old lady

1119
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:46,110
said something, sorry about that.

1120
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Life..

1121
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:54,450
isn't fun when no one's spreading rumors.

1122
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:58,830
Here's another thing that we've learned.

1123
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,230
[What does Matsumoto think of
the first half of Season Zero?]

1124
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:01,370
Eventually, that..

1125
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:03,890
how should I say this?

1126
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:05,010
Uchima, from the Slim Club

1127
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:08,710
He'll do anything!

1128
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:14,150
I had no idea, this type of guy
even exists.

1129
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:15,710
Right?

1130
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:17,750
He'll really do anything.

1131
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,230
He'll tell jokes,
He'll do anything.

1132
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,760
It helps me remember that
these guys do exist.

1133
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:26,210
So, what should we do?

1134
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,960
Well..

1135
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,250
There's not really

1136
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:32,850
any more challenges I can give them.

1137
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:36,270
A lot of them didn't even take a bath.

1138
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:38,710
I can't trap them here.

1139
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:40,630
What should I do?

1140
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:42,290
We're sorry.

1141
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:44,840
[Time Elapsed 6 Hours]

1142
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:56,290
He's sleeping.

1143
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:57,310
I can't do that.

1144
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:58,610
If it's not completely dark

1145
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:00,830
I can't go to sleep.

1146
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:02,440
He's sleeping better than I do.

1147
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:04,640
You know what we should do?

1148
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:10,020
Should we all show our asses?

1149
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,170
Or, maybe we should make our asses speak?

1150
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:13,930
Akiyama and the others can do the voices.

1151
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:16,930
Like some type of ass doll.

1152
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:18,830
Let's do that.

1153
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:20,690
We can have two people show their ass.

1154
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:25,610
So, how should we do it?

1155
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,450
How about Romeo and Juliet

1156
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:32,080
So paint them to look like
Romeo and Juliet?

1157
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:34,670
Or, we could do a married couple.

1158
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,460
Parents or something?

1159
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,180
Let's do Romeo and Juliet.

1160
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:40,280
We can make it dramatic.

1161
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:45,190
For starters,

1162
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:46,530
let's do the man first.

1163
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,330
You're good at this.

1164
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:55,460
Saito will be the girl.

1165
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:56,670
Okay.

1166
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:58,250
Try opening and closing your cheeks.

1167
00:44:58,990 --> 00:44:59,830
Try moving your ass.

1168
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:00,980
That's perfect! That's perfect!

1169
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:02,950
That's perfect! Perfect!

1170
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:04,350
Perfect.

1171
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:07,370
What happened?

1172
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:08,810
What happened?

1173
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:10,660
It's a bit delicate there.

1174
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,470
You can't even feel that.

1175
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,180
No, I can. I feel it.

1176
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:19,860
Well, I'm only human.

1177
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:27,370
Seriously? I'm trying to do this.

1178
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:28,750
Saito, have some self-control.

1179
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:31,140
It itches so bad.

1180
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:35,130
Wake him up when they start talking
to each other.

1181
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:37,050
Instead of just showing them.

1182
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:49,690
Jiro

1183
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:00,190
How are you, Jiro?

1184
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:03,590
You can do it! Keep going.

1185
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,100
How have you been?

1186
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:09,490
You went to Tokyo and went on
that comedy show, right?

1187
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,510
Yeah.

1188
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:14,440
Were you cooperating with everyone, Jiro?

1189
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,970
I heard you didn't make a lot of progress,

1190
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:19,360
and you were always talking about yourself.

1191
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:20,750
Go back to sleep.

1192
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:22,470
The story was different.

1193
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,200
The story was different.

1194
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:26,150
He was really calm about it.

1195
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:27,110
It was a waste waking him up.

1196
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:30,310
He probably saw us getting ready.

1197
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:31,740
Should we do another game?

1198
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:34,130
I'll start.

1199
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:35,790
You can get on all fours.

1200
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,080
Over the net?

1201
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:38,100
Okay.

1202
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:40,840
Can anyone give it out?

1203
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:43,130
That's amazing.

1204
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:45,470
Pull down your pants.

1205
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:46,280
Okay.

1206
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,600
Is that safe?

1207
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:55,120
What are these rules?

1208
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:56,880
Kneel in front of the net.

1209
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:03,910
Mommy.

1210
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,840
That was close. Akiyama almost laughed.

1211
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,220
Watch out! Watch out!

1212
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:22,130
Who was it?

1213
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:36,370
Akiyama.

1214
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:40,410
You're out.

1215
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,420
This was so hard. I can't believe
I'm leaving this far in.

1216
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:53,430
Not now.

1217
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:59,580
[Time Elapsed 8 Hours Stalemate.]

1218
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,380
Thank you for the food.

1219
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:02,740
It's good.

1220
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:03,560
It's delicious.

1221
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:06,960
[8 hours in: Only eating.]

1222
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:08,670
It's good.

1223
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:13,780
[8 hours in: Only eating.]

1224
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,840
I wasn't expecting this type of atmosphere.

1225
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:29,210
Umm..

1226
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:31,350
Probably, not one person

1227
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,810
is going to laugh any more.

1228
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,930
If you put your chopsticks like-

1229
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,090
When I eat, I get really sleepy.

1230
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:46,970
I'm not sure what to do.

1231
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,290
I'm don't know.

1232
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:07,830
We could stop it temporarily,
and take a break.

1233
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:10,580
They'd be pretty tired, right?

1234
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:12,010
[What to do during a stalemate]

1235
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,370
You're right, they'd be tired.

1236
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:15,050
Ah, there's places they can sleep.

1237
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:15,810
Yes.

1238
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:17,530
There are some beds.

1239
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:26,730
Hello?

1240
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:27,780
Hello?

1241
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,090
Um..

1242
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,980
Let's take a short break.

1243
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:32,490
Right, okay.

1244
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:33,980
Um..

1245
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,610
We'll start a timer for one hour.

1246
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:39,150
One hour, okay.

1247
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:40,540
That time,

1248
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:41,950
starts right now?

1249
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:43,080
Right now.

1250
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:44,850
Understood.

1251
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:45,890
Thank you.

1252
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:52,770
He says we're taking a one hour break,
starting now.

1253
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:55,110
Starting now?

1254
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:56,180
One hour.

1255
00:49:57,130 --> 00:49:58,680
I jumped in there.

1256
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:08,070
During the last part,
you went in there too.

1257
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:09,780
I think I did enter.

1258
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:10,870
You did enter.

1259
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,190
Did I? I did do something like that,
didn't I?

1260
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:13,690
You did.

1261
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:19,190
Let's change topics.

1262
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:21,150
This happened in Osaka.

1263
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:24,370
I have a really heartwarming story.

1264
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:25,930
Will you listen to my story?

1265
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,690
Should we all tell one?

1266
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:29,040
Will you?

1267
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,400
I have a heartwarming story.

1268
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:30,690
Okay.

1269
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:32,070
So, I'll start then?

1270
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:33,170
Sure.

1271
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:34,620
Sakata Toshio (EN: 15)

1272
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:36,410
Sakata was a-

1273
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,120
Yes?

1274
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:43,510
Hello?

1275
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:44,070
Yes?

1276
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,300
I'm heading over there now.

1277
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:47,310
Understood.

1278
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:49,930
But the no laughing rule will continue.

1279
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:50,920
Understood.

1280
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:51,970
I'll let them know.

1281
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:54,940
Right now,

1282
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:55,810
Um..

1283
00:50:55,830 --> 00:50:58,140
Matsumoto is on his way, but...

1284
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:00,890
The no laughing rule continues.

1285
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:07,890
That's not good.

1286
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:13,750
Good work.

1287
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:15,620
We've came this far.

1288
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:16,900
Yes.

1289
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:18,130
I thought I'd,

1290
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:19,830
for the time being,

1291
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:22,130
sit here with you guys.

1292
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:23,740
Okay.

1293
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:26,670
If I catch anyone laughing

1294
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:28,510
I can card you right away.

1295
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:30,650
I can laugh though, okay?

1296
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:31,240
Okay.

1297
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,530
You're going to try and make us laugh?

1298
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:35,290
Well, if I think of anything,

1299
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,250
Of course I'll try it.

1300
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:41,630
Okay.

1301
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:47,660
Okay.

1302
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:49,990
So what about that heartwarming story?

1303
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:50,910
Right.

1304
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,340
Koide was going tell us one?

1305
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:53,110
Right.

1306
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:54,390
So, what is it?

1307
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,950
His name is Sakata Toshio.

1308
00:51:57,530 --> 00:51:59,530
When the season is just right.

1309
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:03,890
There's a main street in Osaka
called Midosuji.

1310
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,400
That fall,

1311
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:07,910
Gingko nuts would ripen. (EN: 16)

1312
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:10,210
and fall to the ground.

1313
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:12,110
So Sakata would,

1314
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:13,730
every fall,

1315
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:16,110
go and collect them.

1316
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:17,290
So he could eat them at home.

1317
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:20,270
So, he went to collect them
that year as well.

1318
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:23,720
and he would pick them up
and put them in his bag.

1319
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:27,430
But it's hard to tell if a nut had
been sitting on the ground for awhile.

1320
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:31,410
He would try and check the color
and things like that.

1321
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:35,490
But the best way, was to smell it
and see if it smelled fresh.

1322
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:39,420
One day he saw a nut that was a weird color
and might have gone bad.

1323
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:41,950
He picked it up and when he smelled it

1324
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:44,030
It was poop.

1325
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,630
Which part was heartwarming?

1326
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:52,350
What was heartwarming?

1327
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:54,150
Yeah, what was so heartwarming?

1328
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:56,060
Well his name is Sakata and-

1329
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,230
I have one to tell.

1330
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:58,280
He's popular in Osaka.

1331
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,280
Many years ago,

1332
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:00,670
Yeah.

1333
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:03,640
I had been participating in M1 training.

1334
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:04,140
Right.

1335
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,110
I finished school around 20 years old.

1336
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:09,270
I had never in my life read
a textbook before.

1337
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,950
Then, someone gave me a textbook.

1338
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,040
My parents gave it to me.

1339
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:15,240
Two years later,

1340
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:17,270
During summer vacation

1341
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:19,240
So, it read

1342
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:20,650
"Today

1343
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:21,870
Jiro,

1344
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:24,110
my little sister,

1345
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:25,660
and little brother

1346
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:27,820
all went to see Toy Story 2 together.

1347
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:29,670
My little sister

1348
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:31,850
spilled cup corn

1349
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:33,200
Hm?

1350
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:34,670
She spilled cup corn-

1351
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:35,710
I wrote this down, okay?

1352
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,360
She spilled the cup corn,

1353
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:39,830
and it spilled all over the floor.

1354
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,070
Since she spilled the cup corn.

1355
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:43,750
So the teacher took a red pen, and wrote

1356
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:44,250
"Pop"

1357
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:45,290
"Pop"

1358
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,770
"Pop" and corrected all of the mistakes
in each sentence.

1359
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:51,870
My sister had dropped the cup corn, right?

1360
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:54,510
It was written "Jiro would be angry",

1361
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:59,010
I wrote "Jiro didn't get angry".

1362
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:01,510
The teacher wrote back in red pen,

1363
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,460
"Who is Jiro?"

1364
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:07,950
That's a heartwarming story.

1365
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:08,590
It was.

1366
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:10,160
It made me all fuzzy inside.

1367
00:54:10,370 --> 00:54:11,870
So, heartwarming stories,

1368
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,810
is all that we can tell now?

1369
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:17,780
Well, it looks like that's what
we were going for.

1370
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,090
Ah, let's do this!

1371
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:20,540
This will make things interesting.

1372
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:22,410
Tell me your shortest joke.

1373
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:23,720
Okay.

1374
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:25,790
It doesn't have to be that good.

1375
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:26,980
So my mom,

1376
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:31,120
When the pandemic had just begun,
she was riding the bullet train.

1377
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:34,550
She went with a friend to
Yominojika in Sendai.

1378
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:35,100
So-

1379
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,570
The person sitting in front of my mom

1380
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,760
asked if it was okay to fold the seats.

1381
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:41,690
So, my mom answered,

1382
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:42,740
"Please do."

1383
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:47,070
When I was in 6th grade,

1384
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:49,670
I was 170 cm tall

1385
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:51,350
so they made fun of me a little.

1386
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:55,730
I went to the Osaka Zoo for the first time.

1387
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:56,610
Yeah, the Osaka Zoo.

1388
00:54:57,350 --> 00:54:59,110
An old man was stopped at the ticket gate.

1389
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:01,050
He was stopped by an attendant

1390
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:02,920
When they asked him for a ticket

1391
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:04,100
He said, "I don't need a ticket!"

1392
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:07,420
Right..

1393
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:09,770
I was waiting for the train
at Osaka Station.

1394
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:11,390
When the doors opened

1395
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:13,110
An old man appeared.

1396
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:16,930
Your dad?

1397
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:18,690
I'm the only one laughing

1398
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,290
Laughter is a mystery.

1399
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:22,350
Yeah.

1400
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:25,470
I don't think there's anything
we can do to make you laugh.

1401
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:29,210
If someone sat on this table
and took a crap.

1402
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:30,030
No one would laugh.

1403
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:32,310
With who we've got left,
they definitely won't laugh.

1404
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:33,390
That's exactly what I'm saying.

1405
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:35,970
If one of the staff members
took a crap, we might laugh.

1406
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:40,990
When you tell someone not to laugh,
the opposite happens.

1407
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,900
When it's a TV show about not laughing,

1408
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:44,760
you expect everyone to always be laughing.

1409
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,900
This group definitely isn't going to laugh.

1410
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:48,350
I see.

1411
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:49,390
We're that type-

1412
00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:50,630
I get what you're saying

1413
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:51,740
-of person.

1414
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:54,260
The muscle that I use to laugh
doesn't even work anymore.

1415
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:55,260
Exactly.

1416
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:55,810
It's been half a day.

1417
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:58,310
Hachimitsu is the calmest person here.

1418
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:00,780
If someone like Hatchimitsu
is telling me that,

1419
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:03,270
I don't think he's wrong.

1420
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:06,100
This is really..

1421
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:09,050
This may affect your jobs tomorrow.

1422
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:11,690
The fact that we can never laugh again?

1423

[Time Elapsed 14 hours 25 Minutes]

[Time Elapsed 14 hours 25 Minutes]
[Finish]

1425
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:25,420
We saw a lot of things today.

1426
00:56:25,470 --> 00:56:26,050
[End of experimental Season 0]

1427
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:28,470
Some went on the attack.

1428
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:31,670
Some did things we didn't expect.

1429
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:34,710
Some are fit for this, some aren't.

1430
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:37,150
There are different types of people.

1431
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:39,990
We didn't really get a chance to

1432
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:44,890
See that type of thinking during Season 0.

1433
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,240
Yeah..

1434
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:49,050
Well, if it can't be helped,

1435
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:50,210
then it can't be helped.

1436
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:52,060
Well, it was an experiment.

1437
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:55,650
We wanted to give it a try, so we could
decide the rules for the future.

1438
00:56:56,770 --> 00:56:58,980
We went for 14 and a half hours.

1439
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:01,530
Nothing happened in then end, though.

1440
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:03,500
In the end, that's true.

1441
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:08,050
The hardest part was probably
the unrestricted time limit.

1442
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,410
It's true there weren't any rules,

1443
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:14,710
but no matter what form it takes,
a documentary is a documentary.

1444
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:16,790
We decided that from the beginning.

1445
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,040
But those members definitely went
and created their own rules

1446
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,740
Right?

1447
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:25,030
Whether there were rules or not.

1448
00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:26,670
I wonder what that is.

1449
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,630
Are you working hard in Tokyo?

1450
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:30,170
Jiro!

1451
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:30,940
Jiro!

1452
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:33,730

What are you doing?

1458
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:19,450
You need to pay extra for that.

1459
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:24,970
Let it go.

1460
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:36,390
It's almost time to release Season 4.

1461
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:37,840
Looks like it, huh.

1462
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:38,690
Season 4.

1463
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:40,750
I'm looking forward to it.

1464
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:46,080
What feelings are you carrying
into this documentary?

1465
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:48,600
Well you see,

1466
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:55,930
Every time a different group is invited.

1467
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:57,250
As for me,

1468
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,210
I want to try build a zombie rule,

1469
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:03,390
but I wonder if there is something else
I could do from here.

1470
00:59:03,850 --> 00:59:06,250
I'm going to have to think about it.

1471
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,440
But I think there's plenty.

1472
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:13,730
In order to spice things up a bit.

1473
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:14,990
Right?
