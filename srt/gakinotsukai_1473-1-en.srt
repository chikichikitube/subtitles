First time ever on Gaki no Tsukai

00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,170
Risk it all on one bite and fight for a 100'000 yen prize

00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,710
Kiki mentsuyu (noodle soup base)

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,970
He said 100'000 yen, but I think 20 millions would be better

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,970
Please do it, I'd love to

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,530
I'm going for it

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,600
Ok, if you get it, we'll give you 20 millions

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,970
Are you kidding me?!

9
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,810
You gotta promise that!

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,860
Rules are pretty simple

11
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:34,410
You just have to find the mentsuyu you tasted among the 10 types

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,810
Get it right and you'll earn 100'000 yen: who's going to win?

Our first challenger is Hosei

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,600
Please be nice to me!

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,360
They chose the industry leader

00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,930
"Tsuyu no moto", by Ninben

25
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,220
Its dense and delicate bonito taste

26
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,060
Makes for an excellent product

27
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,090
You can also add wasabi

28
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,570
He ate a lot

29
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:08,770
How is it?

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,930
Amazing, I love this salty taste

31
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,870
I mean, it's mostly soy sauce...

32
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,740
"Salty taste"?

33
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,060
There's more if you wanna go for another slurp

34
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,530
Give me those

35
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,240
Let me borrow your chopsticks

36
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,530
Give him those goddamn chopsticks

37
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,760
He's 51 years old, you know...

38
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,610
Let me say this first

39
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,240
You haven't been nice at all

40
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,320
Which one of us?

41
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,320
All of you!!

42
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,330
How come?

43
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,610
I was clearly suggesting you to pick this one

44
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,520
But I can tell it wasn't this

45
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,210
Why don't you think it's that?

46
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:52,750
He's right

47
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,610
Let me try this first

48
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,830
Why that...?

49
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,130
Yeah, he could be wrong

50
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,090
It could be

51
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,870
Please say the product's name

52
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,930
Its name is...

53
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:06,800
Akomeya... toukyuu...

54
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,180
Are you sure?

55
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,250
It says "soy milk"

56
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,180
He's right, "Akomeya Tokyu"

57
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,800
It's "Tokyo", actually

58
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:16,800
What's going on?

59
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,220
He got it wrong too

60
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,570
It's "Akomeya Tokyo"

61
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,960
And he came here just to correct me

62
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,160
See? It's different

63
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,990
Its smell?

64
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,900
Yeah, it's not close at all, you haven't been nice

65
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,900
But you can't know for sure

66
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,830
You could be wrong

67
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,200
It's completely different

68
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:42,390
What I ate wasn't soy milk mentsuyu ♪

69
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,080
Correct!!

70
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:51,080
No one is gonna laugh at it...

71
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,280
Can I go for "Ago-dashi"?

72
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,210
Oh, a different one

73
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,760
It became popular, lately

74
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,990
It smells so different

75
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,960
I'm glad I ate that

76
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,500
He's eating a lot

77
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:12,620
What I ate wasn't ago-dashi tsuyu ♪

78
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,710
Correct!!

79
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,910
You're laughing a lot, aren't you?

80
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,650
It's 'cause the staff isn't laughing at all

81
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:27,950
[muffled "x isn't what I ate"]

82
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:30,000
Aside from his comedy, his sense of taste is in good shape

83
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,820
And before he realized it, he completed 3 in a row!

84
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,140
I think the one I ate was somehow strong

85
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,070
I think it means it has a high salt content

86
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,070
Can I try this one?

87
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,920
Go for it, permanent boy

88
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,300
How did he call that? Design permanent?

89
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,300
I don't know how to call that

90
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,150
That's new

91
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,830
How about trying it with soumen?

92
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,830
You're right

93
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,770
Oh crap...

94
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,280
Really?

95
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,410
Did you really pick one from the center?

96
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,880
That's dirty, man

97
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,880
I don't think so

98
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,240
But man, it tastes the same

99
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,990
I can't just throw this away

100
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,260
But you said it wasn't "ago-dashi", didn't you?

101
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,260
Yes but I meant it was not that  ago-dashi

102
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,870
But I'm sure is this  ago-dashi

103
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,800
Alright, here goes nothing

104
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,010
Should I go for this one...?

105
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,890
What do you mean?

106
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,710
I'm asking you if I win by bringing this here

107
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,550
I swear today so far you have 0 laugh points

108
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,880
That's why

109
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,900
That's why I can't lose this game

110
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,140
At least, huh?

111
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,160
I feel you

112
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,720
WATCH ME GOOOOOO!!

113
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,780
Alright let's do this, I'm tired of staying behind that table

114
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,500
The one I drank...

115
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,540
"Drank"...?

116
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:24,960
Was Ago-dashi by Mitsukan!

117
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,140
Incorrect!!

118
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,490
Are you kidding me?

119
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,500
He's a mess today...

120
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,300
Your tongue is rotting away!

121
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,010
You expired comedian!

122
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,970
It was this, Ninben's tsuyu-no-moto

123
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:56,890
It was that

124
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,890
It's less intense than that one

125
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:06,210
Woah... it's this one!

126
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,900
Please don't say that

127
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,920
The next contestant is Tanaka

128
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,360
This one...

129
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,050
They have chosen

130
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,440
"Koi-dashi Hontsuyu", by Kikkoman

131
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,530
Its strong flavor goes well as mentsuyu

132
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,470
And it's also excellent for seasoning

133
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,500
Woah, wait a minute

134
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,320
Is it good?

135
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,120
Yeah, it's good

136
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,120
This is bonito

137
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,120
I know

138
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,580
Alright, I'm ready

139
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,280
Let me take this first

140
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,920
Oh! He looked!

141
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,820
You've seen it!!

142
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,200
I didn't see anything

143
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,100
This will cost you a penalty

144
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,020
I din't see it

145
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,020
You've just seen it?

146
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,020
You've clearly seen it

147
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,100
You saw it!

148
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,100
You saw it!

149
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,000
Tanaka, you've seen it, didn't you?

150
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,000
I did

151
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,570
Why?

152
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,570
Why did you look at it?

153
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,220
Wait

154
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,650
Wait, what should we do now?

155
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,340
If he gets it right, he'll get no prize money

156
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,880
Wait a minute, what's my motivation then?!

157
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,880
Let's make it 10'000 yen

158
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,180
It's not a good thing to lie

159
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,820
I thought Yoshimoto employees learned that last summer

160
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,250
Why haven't you learned that?

161
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,090
Yeah, you haven't studied enough!

162
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:25,220
Now you know for sure it's not a soy-milk based one

163
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,560
It's not this, I know

164
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,690
Of course you know

165
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,190
He said "I didn't" when he clearly saw it...

166
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,190
Yeah...

167
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,430
With such a straight face too

168
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,430
He seemed so honest about it

169
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,570
It really felt like it

170
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:39,870
I don't know which is it, but by the circumstances I can narrow it down to 2

171
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,340
But I really don't know which is it

172
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,340
That's because you saw it

173
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,010
I mean...

174
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,580
He looked at it from a 6cm distance!

175
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,350
That's not it, it was just a moment

176
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,630
The moment Tanaka stole a glance

177
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,150
But you know by now how it looks

178
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,350
Let me reenact how it went

179
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,220
Not convincing

180
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,790
But it's still something

181
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,190
It was way closer

182
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,670
Today's episode is crazy

183
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,800
Wrong

184
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,500
Are you talking about its taste?

185
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,500
Or maybe about its looks?

186
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
I'm sure this one's not it

187
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:18,580
Alright, the one I ate was not Iwate's local "Old shop tsuyu"

188
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,010
Correct!!

189
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,010
It's from Sasacho brewery, isn't it?

190
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,880
Why did he took the eyemask away so early?

191
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,320
Real strong tsuyu from Kikoman, here I go

192
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:36,130
I think we all ate this one at least once in our life

193
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,030
Hmm?

194
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,140
Compared to the other I just had, this is way closer

195
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:50,410
How about its looks?

196
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,410
It's close

197
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,410
He just confessed

198
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,150
Oh boy...

199
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,520
Wait a moment...

200
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,260
I think it's this one

201
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,800
The one I just ate

202
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,000
It's really this one, I'm going for it

203
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:19,100
Ok

204
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,110
Is it really true that even if I get this right

205
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,610
I won't get even one cent?

206
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,680
Well yes, can't be helped

207
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:34,090
Ok, let me just get this right first, we'll discuss it later

208
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:39,260
The one I ate was Kikoman's "real strong tsuyu"!

209
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,560
Correct!!

210
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,000
He looked at it, after all

211
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,300
He's not really happy about it, look at him

212
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,050
What is he thinking about?

213
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:11,160
They didn't give him anything

214
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:11,160
They just danced for him

215
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,760
He didn't seem so happy about it

216
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,330
Thank you so much, it was fun playing

217
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,000
I had fun

218
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,070
You could have actually got it right

219
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:24,040
I was so positive I could make it today

220
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,310
Our third challenger is Hamada

221
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,780
You gotta keep in mind Hamada is dumb

222
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,380
For him, they chose Mujirushi's Mentsuyu

223
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,480
It's made of a mix of frigate tuna and bonito

224
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,250
An excellent tsuyu with a refined taste

225
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:43,090
He's not saying anything

226
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,790
What a mouthful

227
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,000
Such a graceful way to eat

228
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,300
How is it?

229
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,560
I guess it's kind of thick

230
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,930
I think

231
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,500
It's like the broth you use for tenzaru soba

232
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,180
No one asked you

233
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,170
I'm pretty sure it had bonito in it

234
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:06,650
This one has shiitake mushrooms, it's not it

235
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:12,020
Could be this ago-dashi here, I don't know

236
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,020
It's a regular bonito broth

237
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,260
Uhhh, bonito broth

238
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,500
Wait

239
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:33,040
It doesn't seem thick enough, though...

240
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,920
If you told me it's this one, I'd agree

241
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:48,740
Huh?

242
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,220
He's stuck
- This is uncommon

243
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,220
Yeah, he's in trouble already

244
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,300
See, I ate a lot of these before

245
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:01,100
And now I narrowed them down to bonito-flavored ones only

246
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:06,240
And there are only these two left, so
I'm gonna taste real quick this other one too

247
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,980
You can't

248
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:15,050
For how long have we been doing this?
- 42 times

249
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,380
It's our 42nd round, man

250
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,520
Why bringing up bonito broth now?

251
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,860
Of course it's going to come out

252
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:34,030
I mean, it's mentsuyu, it's not unusual it's bonito-flavored

253
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,640
Am I allowed to smell it?

254
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,640
- No

255
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,640
You can't

256
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,370
He's eating a lot

257
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,080
This one's really close

258
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,700
Isn't it good?

259
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,880
We can't say anything

260
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,850
I'm not sure about its saltiness

261
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,190
Alright, I'm sticking to my first guess

262
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,190
Shouldn't I?

263
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,040
He's gonna mess up his neck

264
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,570
I guess our viewers just want me to hurry up

265
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:19,040
The one I ate...

266
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,900
Is Yamaki's mentsuyu

267
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,180
Incorrect!!

268
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,180
That was quick!

269
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,680
Way too quick

270
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,020
You got it wrong

271
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:28,840
Here he comes

272
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,560
Not only your face is hideous, your taste buds too!

273
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,220
He's saying pretty awful things

274
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,800
He hit really hard

275
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,970
Some fragments flew away

276
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,970
My ass hurts already...

277
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,410
Which was it?

278
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,610
You were close

279
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:52,130
You think so?
- In a way, yeah

280
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,310
That's right

281
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,650
In a way

282
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:59,680
It was Mujirushi's mentsuyu

283
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,950
You sure?

284
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,950
He has no confidence whatsoever

285
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,950
Alright, I'm ready

286
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,980
Get ready, Endo

287
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,960
The one they chose for Endo

288
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,530
Is Sasacho Brewery's tsuyu, from Iwate prefecture

289
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:19,200
Its matured broth and soy sauce make it shine

290
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,070
A high class mentsuyu

291
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,040
This is thick

292
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,850
Its smell?

293
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,650
Do you usually eat mentsuyu?

294
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,650
Yeah

295
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,720
I eat it a lot when it's summer

296
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,120
Usually for lunch

297
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,230
I really don't think of it as something you eat at night

298
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,200
It's more something you enjoy with your family

299
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,100
What does your wife think?

300
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:46,930
She likes it too---

301
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,430
Hurry up already!!

302
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,170
I think I'm going to find it by chance

303
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,710
I want to try the shiitake one

304
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:59,040
Just to see how different it is

305
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,910
He wants more screentime

306
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,910
He doesn't get much of it

307
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,910
He just wants to appear more

308
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,110
Nope, not this one

309
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,550
That's his biggest flaw

310
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:13,490
The one I ate is not Yamae's shiitake flavored tsuyu

311
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,690
Correct!!

312
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,030
That was an easy one

313
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,030
I was pretty sure about it

314
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:20,870
Now you're clear

315
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:25,170
I think I'm going to try the soy milk one, just in case...

316
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,170
He can't just do that, come on

317
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,940
I think it's essential he has the will to venture

318
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,940
But it's just as Yamazaki said

319
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,940
He already knows that's not it

320
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:40,950
The one I ate is not Akomeya Tokyo's----

321
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,050
Correct!!

322
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,400
Can he say that?

323
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,230
You surprised me with that

324
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,530
Ok, here I go

325
00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:01,670
So, the ones you haven't chose yet are these 5

326
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:07,980
But the one I ate was bonito flavored, pretty simple

327
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:13,320
I don't think it had konbu kelp nor it was ago, it had bonito

328
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,990
This one is also the most expensive

329
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,520
It must be the Isetan one, or the Mitsukoshi

330
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,920
Or the Kinokuniya, I'm going with this

331
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,910
Here comes my prejudice kickin' in, at last...

332
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,680
Mmh? Prejudice?
- At last...?

333
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,850
"Prejudice kicked in"...?

334
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:54,250
I swear the saltiness of the noodles is really close

335
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,690
The noodles have nothing to do with it

336
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:01,270
How should I say it? The chemical reaction from when I put 'em in...

337
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:05,070
I don't think there's any chemical reaction involved

338
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:07,510
You're just putting it in your mouth

339
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,590
I just have to keep on looking for the right bonito broth...

340
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,100
Wrong!

341
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:42,140
The one I ate isn't Sasacho brewery's tsuyu

342
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:50,950
Incorrect!!

343
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,950
Why didn't you go for it?

344
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,920
No way, dude

345
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,320
You were so close

346
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:05,700
Dontcha dare doin' another food report with Tsubokura again!

347
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,970
That was the worst one

348
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,970
What a waste

349
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:17,110
We all failed so far, so you have to get it right, Matsumoto

350
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,110
Why do I have to

351
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,210
Be put under pressure all the times?

352
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:23,710
I know it's something I should say aloud, but...

353
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:26,050
Can we fake my victory?

354
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,550
What?!

355
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:33,560
Just pick that soy milk tsuyu for me

356
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,560
Maybe we should

357
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,560
- Or that other one

358
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,860
The last challenger is Matsumoto

359
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,830
Just pick that white one on the table's edge

360
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,330
They picked this one to outsmart him

361
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,620
It's the soy milk tsuyu Matsumoto requested before

362
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:50,400
This is our only soy milk flavored tsuyu

363
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,400
It's easy to figure this one out, but will he?

364
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:59,680
I must say, it's not as clear to me as I thought it would be

365
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:05,960
This is one of the those with ago? Possibly?

366
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,580
It's considerably watery

367
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:20,540
Mh? You sure you stored this properly?!

368
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,870
Oi, you bastards!!

369
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,870
You're so noisy

370
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,710
It's sweet

371
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,870
The first thing that came to my mind is the ago broth

372
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:38,590
Because I haven't really ate it before

373
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:42,020
So I think the possibilities it's ago broth are high

374
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,500
It's not this one right? Or did you actually choose it?

375
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,640
Shoul I just go for it?

376
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,750
You can at least reply to me, you know

377
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,650
I just asked if I should go for it, answer me

378
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,450
It's 'cause this is our last round, you know

379
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,350
I think I should start from here to get it right, right?

380
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,060
Can this really be chosen as the last one?

381
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,670
Completely wrong

382
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,850
Completely wrong, I can do this

383
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:36,200
Totally wrong, what I ate was not Kikoman's strong tsuyu broth

384
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,620
Correct!!

385
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:40,620
Alright, I was really sure about that one

386
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,150
It must be the ago broth, after all

387
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:49,230
"ago" (type of broth) in japanese also means "chin"

388
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:49,230
Sorry, when I said "ago" I looked at you, Tanaka

389
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,230
No offense taken

390
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,770
Matsumoto is leaving the ago broth ones for last

391
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,430
And proceeds without risks

392
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:05,850
Why does it have to take this long to ring?

393
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:11,050
Alright, it's time to try this one, isn't it?

394
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,970
I just have to

395
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,800
I'm trying this

396
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,600
I didn't think this...

397
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,900
Oh no

398
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,540
My memories are gradually fading away

399
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,540
Holy crap

400
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:38,040
This is pretty close

401
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,710
Did you actually do it?

402
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,150
That's not it, right?

403
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:50,820
You can talk, you know

404
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:53,000
This is weird

405
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:58,350
Wait a second

406
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:07,540
I never had ago broth before

407
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,070
So I have no idea

408
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:12,440
Maybe this is not it

409
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:19,050
But if I get past this one, I finally enter the ago broth zone

410
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:20,720
Right?

411
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,860
This feels like bullying, really

412
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,860
No way

413
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:34,830
It's not like that, I swear

414
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:49,960
(Do not try this at home)

415
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:49,960
(Endo becomes gay... again)

416
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:49,960
(Man showing his d*ck to young ladies)

417
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:49,960
(Missed tip-tap master)

418
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:49,960
(The king of pop would be so proud)

419
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:49,960
(Yamazaki being racist)

420
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:49,960
(how to make bubble tea even more useless)

421
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:49,960
(subs by TofuPanda)

422
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:49,960
(time slip from when the world was a nice place to live in)

423
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:49,960

427

The one I ate wasn't Akomeya Tokyo's soy milk mentsuyu, please!

428
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,060
Incorrect!

429
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,160
You friggin' did it!!

430
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,770
He did

431
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,870

Thank you!!

433
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:16,070
You're really good friends after all!

At least get it right!

436
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,180
"Can we fake my victory?"

437
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,320
Wait a minute guys, I'm in a state of shock

438
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:33,320
Quit the proteins

439
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,760
And start drinking mentsuyu!

440
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,550
You thought it was ago tsuyu

441
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,670
Yeah I was sure about it

442
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:48,820
If only you would have talked to me some more!

443
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:53,770
You really bullied me here, giving me that cold attitude and everything

444
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,850
No way

445
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,850
I'm dead serious

446
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,850
Final thoughts?

447
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:01,800
You're really good guys, friends are the best!

448
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:03,970
So friggin' loud
