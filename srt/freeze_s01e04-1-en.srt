00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,660
Alright, the losers are back!

3
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:32,070
Something cute came slinking in...

4
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,150
And it turned out to be a little dog.

5
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,370
But I actually thought it might
be an exploding robot dog.

6
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,640
Seriously?

7
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,920
I was about to burst out laughing.

8
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,400
I was so embarrassed.

9
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,360
I was like, "this can't be real."

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,250
What's with that dog? Did
they train him to smell me?

11
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:54,050
This dog really likes the smell of urine.

12
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,260
That's really embarrassing.
Please cut that.

13
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,770
He peed!

14
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,380
- He peed!
- A little bit.

15
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,410
What's with that dog?

16
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,310
That's so weird.

17
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,640
I mean, he's cute and all.

18
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,360
He was pretty cute.

19
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:57,460
I kinda feel bad that we
watched him pee. I mean...

20
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,670
I think I've heard this sound before.

21
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,990
Something's coming.

22
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,700
What? What's coming?

23
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,090
I mean, we...

24
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:20,500
Okay.

25
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,150
That's good.

26
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,560
That's right.

27
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,800
Everyone is even right now.

28
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,070
Alright.

29
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:46,120
Some people have seen
this before and some haven't.

30
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,510
Some of them will be like, "This again?"

31
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,050
Others will be wondering
what's about to happen.

32
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,860
Non-chan...

33
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,180
They're getting stained.

34
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,160
It's coming from far away right now.

35
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,330
Let's go.

36
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,340
It's grabbing quite a lot.

37
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,310
Here we go.

38
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,280
Don't drop it.

39
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,300
I wouldn't like that.

40
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,420
This must be tough for Fujimon.

41
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,040
Okay, let's continue.

42
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:43,060
Once the arm is gone, the egg will...

43
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,710
What was that?!

44
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,860
- What? What broke?
- Damn it!

45
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,730
- The dish is broken!
- The dish broke!

46
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,300
- That's dangerous!
- It flew everywhere!

47
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,050
Hot!

48
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,200
- What was that?
- What was it?

49
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,360
- Fujimoto...
- Why me? Why just me?

50
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,160
That thing was super hot.

51
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,300
What was it?

52
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,330
It was super hot.

53
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,950
That robot...

54
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:54,790
The worst part was it
stayed there the whole time.

55
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,710
I hate loud sounds the most.

56
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,640
And it went like, "Bang!"

57
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,070
I really hate explosions.

58
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,020
Everyone flinched.

59
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,330
No one can get used to sudden explosions.

60
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,640
- That's true.
- For real.

61
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,420
It was super hot, and
it wouldn't move away.

62
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,560
Let's go again.

63
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,540
No, no.

64
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,090
No way...

65
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:08,090
No way, no, it's too scary.

66
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,310
No way!

67
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,520
No way! No way!

68
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,220
No way! No way! No way!

69
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,590
No way! I can't!

70
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,800
I can't! I can't!

71
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,340
No! No! No! No!

72
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,860
No! No way!

73
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,080
- Non-chan really hates this.
- No way! I can't handle it!

74
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,470
That's so funny.

75
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,110
What about Shizu-chan?

76
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,330
Go to Shizu-chan.

77
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,650
- No way! I really can't!
- Shizu-chan.

78
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,010
Let's go to Kuro-chan.

79
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,070
I can't! No way!

80
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,600
Go to Kuro-chan.

81
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,210
It'll be surprising if
Kuro-chan can handle it.

82
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,430
Wow!

83
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,990
He's good!

84
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,130
This is...

85
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,720
This is amazing!

86
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:38,980
Kuro-chan is good!

87
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,940
- Kuro-chan is doing great!
- So scary.

88
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,590
Alright, let's get off.

89
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,660
That's enough.

90
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,240
- Let's fly away.
- Scary, scary!

91
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,870
I can't! No way! No way!

92
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,590
I'm so scared! Seriously!

93
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,930
I just moved instinctively.

94
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,750
Wow, Kuro-chan is amazing.

95
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,880
You sure endured it!

96
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,370
It went into my ear!

97
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,340
Into my ear!

98
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,930
I was so scared! Oh my god!

99
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:39,220
- What the heck?!
- It was so scary! I can't.

100
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:46,960
- You two were moving way too much.
- I mean, I couldn't help it.

101
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,930
My body just moved on its own.

102
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,710
- It was instinct.
- I get why Suzuki moved...

103
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,240
- Look! She's crying!
- I can't.

104
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,650
A spider this big appeared!

105
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,490
Out of all the creatures in this world,

106
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:05,330
I hate spiders the most.

107
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:10,550
I mean, tarantulas are a no-go.

108
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,320
This is amazing!

109
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,340
Kuro-chan is good!

110
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,130
I guess it's because they move
a little and make rustling sounds.

111
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,690
You can't be doing that! It was so scary.

112
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,990
It's dangerous even.

113
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,120
I need a second. I can
still feel the gross-ness.

114
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,600
I'm fine when they're balled
up, but then they reach out.

115
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,740
Suzuki has already lost her cool.

116
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:14,900
This must be hell for them.

117
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,210
What's going on here?

118
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,680
Just shower him.

119
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,220
Alright, go back.

120
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,200
Go back, go back.
Thank you.

121
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,460
Okay, good job.

122
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,720
Alright.

123
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,130
Enough?

124
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,690
I'm going crazy!

125
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:06,240
- You didn't move despite all that.
- I just wanna give up!

126
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,990
That's amazing.

127
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,110
How come Bobby sneezed?

128
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,420
All the powder was coming this way!

129
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,650
You sneezed so suddenly,
everyone started laughing.

130
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,310
What was that?

131
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,960
What was the point of that?

132
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,910
That's not something you
should be allowed to do.

133
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:39,130
At first, I thought I'd
be able to endure it.

134
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,320
But then I was like, "no way."

135
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:47,340
I started thinking, "I can't keep
getting showered by this stuff."

136
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:52,450
Instinctively, my body
wanted to get the powder out.

137
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,720
- Here we go.
- What was that?

138
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,690
Non-chan...

139
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,390
Let's get started.

140
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,240
Let's go to Shizu-chan.

141
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,690
Alright, go to the next one.

142
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,740
Let's do a switcheroo here.

143
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,380
Shizu-chan again.

144
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,560
Go!

145
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:31,630
Go!

146
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,240
Alright.

147
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:47,820
To someone else.

148
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,210
Round and round.

149
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,990
Yes, round and round.

150
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,340
Let's try Bobby.

151
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,750
Go to Bobby.

152
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,160
Wait a little while.

153
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,390
A few more times.

154
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,890
Again.

155
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,800
Let's do it two more times.

156
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,290
Okay, let's move.

157
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,990
Let's go to someone else.

158
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,270
That's too much. Let's move.

159
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,940
Move, move, move.

160
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,580
What to do...

161
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,690
Should we try Fujimon again?

162
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,450
Let's go to Bobby again. Do him again.

163
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,680
Go back to Bobby. Go back, go back.

164
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,660
Back to Bobby.

165
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,480
Alright, hit it.

166
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,790
Let's go back.

167
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,450
If you're gonna do it, just do it!

168
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,300
If you're gonna do it, just do it!

169
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,450
If you're gonna do it, JUST DO IT!

170
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:41,850
Bobby, sit down.

171
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,410
Bobby, let's sit down.

172
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,270
- Sit down for now.
- Let's sit.

173
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,640
Let's sit for now.

174
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,740
Let's sit.

175
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,210
Huh? What?

176
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,460
Good job, everyone.

177
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,160
- Good job.
- It's over?

178
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,600
How was it?

179
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:06,610
- What do you mean?
- "How was it"?

180
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,890
"How was it", you ask?

181
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,450
No way!

182
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,740
No way! No way!

183
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,800
No way! No way! No way!

184
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,310
Wait a little while.

185
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,000
A few more times.

186
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:41,100
I mean, personally
I'd love to keep going...

187
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,990
- Let's stop.
- No more.

188
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,630
You're the only one having fun.

189
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,030
Right?

190
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,950
A lot happened, but I made a decision!

191
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,190
What?

192
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:53,970
The revived loser...

193
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,210
and winner is...

194
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,580
Kuro-chan!

195
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,350
I did it! I did it!

196
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,410
I win!

197
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,250
Kuro-chan is good!

198
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,590
Kuro-chan is doing great!

199
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,830
As expected...

200
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,840
He endured that big spider.

201
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,090
Congratulations.

202
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:18,120
Wait, you're sticky. It's getting on me.

203
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,460
I was clean...I was clean...

204
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,650
I'm here!

205
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:27,780
Who are you?

206
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,160
It's Kuro-chan!

207
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,610
You know me, don't you?

208
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,250
That hairstyle!

209
00:21:49,260 --> 00:22:14,510
