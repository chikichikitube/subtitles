00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,000
People who lose control of their emotions

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This, is that complete documentary.

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:29,400
subbed by jesper (www.jesperong.com)

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:29,400
thanks to kengho for helping out

00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:29,000

00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:29,000
Yamazaki

00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:29,000
color coding:

12
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Here, the members assemble.

13
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,000
By the look on their faces, they're still carrying smiles.

14
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Well then, guys

15
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
There's a sign there

16
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
(sign: wait here)

17
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
As always, the bags have no relation whatsoever.

18
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
This is irritating!

19
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You can actually see him from where the bus was can't you?

20
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:19,300
Fujiwara Hiroshi

21
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Hey you guys!

22
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,000
You're not being very cautious at all.

23
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But we already saw you from the bus

24
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,500
The stupid look on your faces is completely exposed.

25
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,000
Well we can see you from here too.

26
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,500
It's.... completely exposed.

27
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Do you know why...

28
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,500
...I'm on a stakeout, Yamazaki?

29
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,000
Me?

30
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,500
You're supposed to be a woman right?

31
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,400
Well, I can't say I know why

32
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,200
Why are you such an idiot?

33
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,500
If a celebrity,

34
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,100
acts like an idiot it won't do you know.

35
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,500
It becomes an unthinkable scoop

36
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,800
Sorry, who the hell are you supposed to be?

37
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,400
It's been decided that we're news reporters

38
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,500
As newbie reporters,

39
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,700
everyday, various...

40
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,100
no, not everyd..... Sorry.

41
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,000
How can you not laugh at this?

42
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,300
Act out your character properly!

43
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,100
As newbie reporters,

44
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,100
You have to take the various scoops as they come.

45
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,500
Speaking of "news reporters",

46
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,600
what's up with your appearances?

47
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,000
Well, we've only just heard about this.

48
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,500
Can't be helped

49
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,400
There're boxes(changing rooms) over there,

50
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,400
Go get changed quickly.

51
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:49,500
(Getting changed to the appropriate attire)

52
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,000
We'd like to at least decide on our own costumes yea?

53
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,400
Please step out in sequence.

54
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,700
Firstly, Hamada

55
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,600
- Oh fits you rather nicely.   - Oh yea? Thanks

56
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,800
(Competent old reporter Hamada)

57
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,400
Matsumoto

58
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:14,000
(Bald hoodlum reporter Matsumoto)

59
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:15,000
The cap sorta suits him

60
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Doesn't this look right for hunting?

61
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,300
Why here....

62
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,100
I look like a caddy don't I?

63
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,900
Yea you're right

64
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,400
Endou

65
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,600
(Fresh, handsome reporter Endou)

66
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Tanaka

67
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:40,500
(Skinny, lanky reporter Tanaka)

68
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,500
Yamazaki

69
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,200
What the hell?

70
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:51,300
(Oldboy reporter Yamazaki)

71
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,600
What's the meaning of this?

72
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,500
"What's the meaning"?.. This was there

73
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,500
You again...

74
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,100
If a celebrity acts like an idiot it won't do no?

75
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,400
This is a huge scoop!

76
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,100
If you keep that look, then it's enough

77
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,600
Ok guys gather round here

78
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,000
Let me explain the rules.

79
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
First of all

80
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,300
From now, you'll be working as news reporters for a day

81
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,300
Next,

82
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,400
Once we board the bus, you're not to laugh no matter what happens.

83
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
*cough*

84
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Suppose you do laugh

85
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,700
You will receive a harsh punishment

86
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,000
Well I don't really understand what that means

87
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But somehow I don't think it's a good thing either

88
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That's all.

89
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,900
Well then, shall we head to the bus-stop?

90
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,000
Is it time?

91
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Is it starting already?

92
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,500
Matsumoto-sempai, this is ridiculous isn't it?

93
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,800
I heard it was supposed to be paradise

94
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,200
For real

95
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,000
Ah, it's here.

96
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,900
Kurobikari News Company

97
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,400
Ga-su- Kurobikari..

98
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,500
Ah! To "Ga-su- Kurobikari News Company"

99
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,400
This is the name of company you'll be working for from now on

100
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,800
For celebrities, your reactions are pretty weak

101
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,300
No well, we don't really know what's going on.

102
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,800
It starts once we get on right?

103
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,200
We're a little nervous you see

104
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,500
Ok, let's get on.

105
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,800
It'll start once you get on

106
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,800
Ahh crunch time!

107
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,200
Here I go

108
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,600
Arrange yourselves -

109
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,200
Yamazaki, Matsumoto, Hamada, Endou, Tanaka

110
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,500

111
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,100
1st seat Yamazaki

112
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,200
Scary~

113
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,500
I don't wanna go to this so-called news company

114
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,100
Is it far?

115
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,700
I don't...

116
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,000
...think it'll take long.

117
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,700
It's bad talking to that guy

118
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,700
He fumbles on his own words

119
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,200
Yea you're right

120
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,400
Fujiwara-san, what kind of character are you playing?

121
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,900
I can't really tell

122
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,100
I'm a beautiful reporter!

123
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,800
It's a first for me

124
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,200
(Bus-stop Arrival)

125
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,400

127
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,000
(Matsuko Deluxe boards)

128
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,100
That's dirty!

129
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,600
That face is bad! It appeared all of a sudden!

130
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,100
(Receive ass-beating from Black Tights Corps)

131
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
My ass is crying!

132
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,500
(Corporate OL - Matsuko Deluxe)

133
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,700
What's up for today?

134
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,800
What should we do?

135
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,900
She came in with a face full of confidence

136
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,500
Deluxe, you're really popular with men aren't you

137
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,100
I'm so jealous~

138
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,200
I attract the weird ones, can't help it though

139
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,500
Rumor has it that Yamashita-san from the sales department

140
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,000
is also interested in Deluxe

141
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,700
It's totally hopeless!

142
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Hey look

143
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,800
Those 5 guys have been staring at Deluxe since just now

144
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,900
Deluxe is too popular~

145
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,900
Say about the first guy on this side,

146
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,400
(Deluxe evaluates the 5 guys)

147
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,000
Welllll... not bad...

148
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,200
What about the second guy with the shaved head?

149
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,900
Somehow it's difficult to say

150
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,300
Ahhh... I seeee....

151
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,000
What about the third guy?

152
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,800
That guy, even though he doesn't look very sharp

153
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,400
doesn't he look honest?

154
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,600
Doesn't he look respectable?

155
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,100
Then then, the next g...

156
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,500
That one looks extremely good!

157
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,700
(Endou is extremely good-looking ?)

158
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,800
(Since they have already begun laughing, please enjoy until the next bus-stop)

159
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,300
What about the last guy?

160
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,000
...Impossible...

161
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,400
Isn't that pubic hair on his head?

162
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,300
It's pubic hair!

163
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:07,500
(Not completely taken in - Tanaka)

164
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,500
Eeww.. Disgusting~

165
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,100
It's sorta making me angry

166
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,100
Eh? What's wrong?

167
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,100
Hold on, I'm going over there

168
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,400
(Deluxe draws near)

169
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,700
Oi, step outside

170
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,200
You! Step outside!

171
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,200
That's cheap!

172
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,900
She's still looking, still scowling.

173
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,500
She's humongous..

174
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,500
What made her flip like that?

175
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,400
Let's quickly leave! Let's go!

176
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,400
Why were you so detestable?

177
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,100
I have absolutely no idea.

178
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,900
She's staring really hard

179
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,800
Totally staring.

180
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,400
If Deluxe was thin, he'd be a handsome guy no?

181
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,200
Seriously, why do you say so?

182
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,500
Why? "If he was thin, he'd be a handsome guy"?

183
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,200
Huge eh?

184
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,300
Another bus-stop?

185
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,300
(Bus-stop arrival)

186
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,300
Wah!

187
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,300
Here it comes

188
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,200
Wah.. here we go

189
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,300
Somehow somewhat that's what I thought

190
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,400
If you're nervous it won't succeed

191
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,200
But we practiced alot

192
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,800
(Chinese - Gekidan Hitori & Yamauchi Kenji "Kamaitachi")

193
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,300
Good thing we did yea?

194
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,400
Really anxious yea?

195
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,300
You're nervous aren't you?

196
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,800
Look, how about trying them?

197
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,000
How about having them

198
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,300
look at our magic?

199
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,300
Excuse me!

200
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,900
We're magicians from China

201
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,900
Now, would you mind having a look at our magic?

202
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,300
Ah. ok.

203
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,500
- Thanks   - Please look

204
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,400
This trick has no set-up

205
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,700
This here is just a long cotton swab

206
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,100
It'll be stuffed into the nose

207
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,400
It'll then disappear altogether

208
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:53,700
(Original Magic - Cotton swab disappears in the nose)

209
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It won't disappear you know

210
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Do it

211
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's long you know

212
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Just do it

213
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I can't do it

214
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It doesn't matter

215
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Nono, Impossible impossible

216
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,200
YOU CAN DO IT!!

217
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,300
i can do it

218
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,700
I don't know how to do this

219
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,800
Please look here

220
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,100
EHAHgrhh~ ENDOU-SAN

221
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,300
ENDOU-SAN

222
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,100
ENDOU-SAN

223
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,400
Stop saying Endou-san will you

224
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,400
ENDOU-SAN

225
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,800
This is absolutely impossible to withstand

226
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,900
Now, this time you'll do it

227
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,300
A hot boiled egg will be placed in the mouth and then disappear

228
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,200
(Original Magic 2 - Boiling egg disappears in the mouth)

229
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,300
I can't do this

230
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,700
It's really hot!

231
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,500
It'll disappear in your mouth

232
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,700
I can't do it

233
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,500
I can't do it..

234
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,500
YOU CAN DO IT IDIOT

235
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,600
WHY DO YOU JUST ASSUME YOU CAN'T?!

236
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,000
i can do it

237
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,000
Here I go!

238
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,000
*cough cough*

239
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,000
Why you...!

240
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,600
Throats are supposed to be narrow right?!

241
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,600
Throats are narrow?

242
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,800
What're you doing?

243
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,200
Because your throat is narrow

244
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,800
I thought expanding it would be good

245
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,400
What the hell

246
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,300
There's no magic here at all!

247
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,600
Are you idiots?!

248
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,700
What are you trying to do?

249
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,000
If you're gonna die from doing magic, then this is enough

250
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Stop... OK?

251
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,800
Pull your act together will you

252
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,400
Guys, fix those faces

253
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,300
We didn't come to Japan for the sake of this

254
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,200
We came from China, just the two of us

255
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,700
hoping to become stars

256
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,100
We wanted to show the people back home...

257
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,100
our radiant appearance

258
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,700
Remember?

259
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,600
The song that was on the radio when we left China?

260
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
Long-winded!

261
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,100
Stop whining and shut up!

262
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:04,800
Oi, let's go!

263
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,300
What're you doing!?

264
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,800
These guys are extreme!

265
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,700
Ah.. It's amazing..

266
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,800
Can we just hurry to the news company?

267
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,400
(Just 15 minutes into work, there is already a "punishment" rush)

268
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:52,000
(But there's still a long way before reaching the news company)

269
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,900
(They're wary of the senior high student in front of them)

270
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,600
Hello

271
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,600
(Violation of manners - Having a conversation in a vehicle)

272
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,600
Eh? What? Are you an idiot?

273
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,300
Really? That's weird of you

274
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,900
Oi oi

275
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,600
That's awful of you - on the phone in a bus!

276
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,400
(From the back, a middle-aged salaryman appears)

277
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:45,500
(Oowada Shin'ya)

278
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,000
You're bothering everyone can't you see

279
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,400
Hand it over

280
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,600
Hold on, what're you doing?

281
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,400
When you're in the bus,

282
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,000
you shouldn't use your mobile, it's common knowledge

283
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,500
(Oowada's preaching begins)

284
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,300
You know don't you?

285
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,800
Are you in junior or senior high?

286
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,000
- Senior high   - Senior high?

287
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,000
Which year?

288
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,500
Senior 1st year

289
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,200
Well, that means your exams are soon right?

290
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,500
Ehh?!

291
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,800
If you can, try to understand alright?

292
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,400
(Bus-stop arrival)

293
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,200
If you understand then respond!

294
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,700
Yes.

295
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,700
Oh Akira!

296
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,000
Takeshi!

297
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,800
Somehow I've been caught up with some weird geezer

298
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,200
Oi, old man!

299
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,200
What business you got wit Akira?

300
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,900
(Oowada in a pinch!!)

301
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:58,700
I'm just trying to educate him about not using the mobile in the bus

302
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,600
Who here saw a phone bein' used?

303
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,300
Nobody oi!

304
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,000
In a train, a mobile...

305
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,200
It's a bus yes?

306
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,000
Stop beating around the bush oi!

307
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,100
Can't we discuss about this huh

308
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,100
Geezer, alight at the next stop

309
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,610
I can't, I'm going to work

310
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,300
(Bus-stop arrival)

311
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,500
- Get off!       - What is this!

312
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,800
Alright! Tell you what.

313
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,300
So you wanna have a go at it huh?

314
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,400
Then...

315
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,300
...Follow me!

316
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,900
(Oowada escapes!!)

317
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,800
His leg went limp!

318
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,800
It did! It did!

319
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,400
His leg went limp didn't it?

320
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,300
It must really hurt

321
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,700
His leg went limp c'mon!

322
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,400
I guess it wouldn't just end with that

323
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,400
His leg went limp..

324
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,300
That was an amazing combination

325
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,300
Yea

326
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,900
I didn't even know he was sitting there

327
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,500
Was he there since the beginning?

328
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,200
I guess so

329
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,600
This is really taxing

330
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,600
Oh. Something's there

331
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,900
(Bus-stop arrival)

332
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,400
More people coming on board?

333
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,500
You're kidding!

336
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,100
Sorry.. I'm really sorry

337
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,700
Really. Sorry

338
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,600
This is messed up!

339
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
This is really scary!

340
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,300
What's the purpose of this?

341
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,900
He's always staring at me or Matsumoto

342
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,100
(Ishikura left on the floor)

343
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:27,580
What're you gonna do about this?

344
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,620
What're you gonna do about this?

345
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,000
(Bus-stop arrival)

346
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,800
His face turned sour when it met his feet!

347
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,800
Woah! He's still looking

348
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,800
He's still looking!

349
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,600
Woah scary!

350
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,100
Like an occult

351
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,600
Why did you have to go look a second time?

352
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,600
Let's go already

353
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,400
Yea

354
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,400
Are we reaching?

355
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,300
Yea just a little more

356
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,900
That's what you've always been saying!!

357
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,400
Could you not speak with such Tsukkomi-like timing?

358
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,300
The art of timing Tsukkomi lines..

359
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,400
is what makes it funny

360
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,600
That's true

361
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,300

(News Company founder - Suga Kenji "youth")

377
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,900
Cute huh?

378
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,500
Because of this youngster's...

379
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,700
...passion for journalism...

380
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,000
This company, from his passion

This comp...

382
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,900
This news comp... huhu... company has come to exist

383
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,300
What do you think?

384
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,100
How many times do you need to repeat yourself

385
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,900
Their brandishing hurts

00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,700
Our company is also active in cultural exchanges globally

388
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
We received this during a partnership agreement

389
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,900
with a Chinese news company - a stuffed panda.

390
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,600
It's name is Mun Mun

391
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,600
Ah... It's Nun Nun

392
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,500
Wait, Hamada-san laughed too!

393
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,700
Just now at the front gate, Hamada did laugh though

394
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,200
Read properly, it's Nun Nun

395
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,700
It'd be bad if they really did kill it

396
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,700
(This is not a real stuffed animal)

397
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,800
Hamada-san laughed

398
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,100
This is a pretty messed up company

399
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,700
This is a picture taken from that time

400
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,260

00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,500
Ok alright sorry we're done

404

Please no more Suga-san

He kept repeating "agreement"

410
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,100
Well then, let me introduce you to the receptionist

411
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,400
Yes. Suga-san - Clear.

412
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,500
Huh? The reception lady isn't here.

(Receptionist - Katahira Nagisa)

417
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,900
This development is too unpredictable!

418
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,500
Fujiwara-san, good morning

419
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,400
These gentlemen are?

420
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:44,800
From today, they'll be under training to become reporters

421
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,500
Ahh.. so that's how it is

422
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,600
The truth is I did think you looked inexperienced

423
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,200
You.

424
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,400
Your name is?

425
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,000
I'm called Hamada

426
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Hamada-san? And your given name is?

427
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Ah. Masatoshi.

428
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,600
Ah... by the way, your father's name is...

429
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,800
It's Kengorou..

430
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,000
Eh? Kengorou?!

431
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,000
What's up with that sound effect

432
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,100
This one's dangerous, really dangerous

434
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,400
Let's see...

435
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,400
You. What's your name?

436
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
It's Yamazaki

437
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,900
Yamazaki-san, have you settled down yet?

438
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,400
I see...

439
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,900
So, when you get home,

440
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:48,100
a meal prepared by your wife should be waiting for you right?

441
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,000
Yes.

442
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,200
What's the best dish from the Yamazaki household?

443
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,400
I guess that would be our Pork Cutlet

444
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,800
PORK CUTLET!?

445
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,500
Shit! Anything you say can be used

446
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,400
There're still some of you I've yet to know...

447
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,000
This gentleman here, your name is?

448
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,800
I'm called Endou

449
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,900
Um.. During your school years, what was your best subject?

450
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,700
Sports. I liked baseball very much

451
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,100
Then shall we have a little test?

452
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,700
Can you recite the alphabets for me?

453
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,300
You're terrible!

454
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,300
Anyway, please do your best for this first day

455
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,100
It really hurts..

456
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,500
It's really amazing this time round huh...

457
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,500
I don't get it.. I should know the 26 alphabets

460
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,700

00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,700
Ah. Hello.

Well.. I...

465
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,400
...thought it was 8:2 you see...

(A confirmed blunder in the insurance company's ratio)

467
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,000
That was harsh.

100%

470

471
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,200
Ah here they come

472

First off, you.

Which do you prefer?

496
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,500
The taste of curry from curry...

497
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,800
Oh the taste of curry from curry?

498
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,600

At last!

523
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,200
At long last! Finally

524
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,900
So guys, sit at your desks

525
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,600
Just to get here, we had to go through many terrible things

526
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,200
It was long

527
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,200
Its gonna be a long day today

528
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:03,000
Ahh... this is tiring

00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,600
"Maeda Bibari speaking" she said

530
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,300
Those kinds of things should be said only once

531
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,800
There's no need to repeat it

532
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,900
In my opinion, Endou has been laughing at everything

533
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,900
Yea

534
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,700

535
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,800
Hold on, I have a "laughing" face

536
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,800
No you don't

537
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,700
You're laughing right now too

538
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,700
Yamazaki and I are relatively more disciplined right

539
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,500
That's not true!

540
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,400
No but umm

541
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,300
When Fujiwara-san made a mistake back there about the panda's name?

542
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,400
You laughed at that didn't you?

543
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,900
Noo~pe

544
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,300
Didn't you laugh and get away with it?

545
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,300
Stop being so rough!

546
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,200
You should stop destroying yourself

547
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,560
Yea you should stop it

548
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,100
Do you think there's anything planted in our desks?

549
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:20,100
(Everyone's cautious about what's in their desk drawers)

550
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,100
If I'm not wrong there should be

551
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:40,000
(CO2 gas from the drawer)

552
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,300
I didn't think there'd be an accident!

553
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,600
Eh? it's this kind of system?

554
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,400
EhHhH~

555
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,100
You're kidding!

556
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,200
I thought I was gonna die.. really..

557
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,200
I was really frightened

558
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,400
That really scared the hell outta me!

559
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,700
Wah.. Now its scary to open them

560
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,100
This is the first time in my life

561
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,300
to really slip and fall off a chair

562
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,400
That was inevitable

563
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,700
Matsumoto-san couldn't have seen anything, except for pure-white

564
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,800
Ah. I remember, somehow really

565
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,100
It was instant right?

566
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,000
Yea, in that instant, I was thinking -

567
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
"An accident! An accident is happening!"... Somehow

568
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,100
This conversation is long huh

569
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,800
Well I understand

570
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,100
It can't be helped, if the cause of it is like that

571
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,400
Yea, you regret opening it

572
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,400
If it's your own, open it yourself

573
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,100
Endou, open yours

574
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,900
(Taking turns to open the drawers)

575
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,900
Woah this is really scary!

576
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,400
Here I go

577
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,800
Open it normally

578
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,000
Empty

579
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,500
I see, so this means there won't be anything

580
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,300
There's nothing

581
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,300
Empty

582
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,200
Why did you have to pull it so hard?

583
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,400
Why did you have to pull it so hard just now?

584
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,000
We would've been happier if you did it gently

585
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,800
Here I go

586
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:50,590
WAAAHHH

587
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,000
Empty

588
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,790
I'm sorry

589
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,300
Tanaka you're noisy

590
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,730
Tanaka!

591
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,900
Tanaka being scared like this isn't a good thing

592
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,900
It'll be better if you do it fast

593
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,500
NgAaaaah

594
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:10,500
Sports Newspaper

595
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,500
What the hell!

596
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,600
Why was I the very the first one to open this drawer this time round?

597
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,500
It's as if everything the staff planned will happen

598
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,000
You got that right

599
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,700
There're signs that this third table was tampered with

600
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,500
Matsumoto-san, please open the drawers

601
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,900
Well why don't you stick that up my ass

602
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,600
(I'm very unsure about this)

603
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,100
Why don't you....

604
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,600
...stick that up my ass

605
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,300
That's harsh isn't it?

606
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,700
It's been a long time since things are happening to my pace

607
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:59,000
There should be something, everyone else doesn't have it

608
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:02,000
I think we should deal with what's already at hand first

609
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,900
Woah, you're gonna open them all?

610
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,100
There it is!

611
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:18,500
(Suspicious button found!!)

612
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,500
Not this again!

613
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,800
Because you had to open it, Yamazaki-san

614
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,100
But I had to

615
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,800
Isn't it abit too early for us to have found this?

616
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,600
Well if we don't press it everything will be fine no?

617
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,200
There's no need to push it on purpose

618
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,200
That's true

619
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,500
It's found from Yamazaki's desk anyway

620
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,400
But I'm afraid I'd anger someone if I have to press it

621
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,100
What's there to get angry about?

622
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,100
Who'd get angry?

623
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:40,800
Someone will

624
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:46,800
(1 hour passed)

625
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,400
(It is still undecided on what to do with the dubious button)

626
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,700
Hey, there's a clock here this time

627
00:43:55,700 --> 00:44:01,000
(First clock in the Batsu Series)

628
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,800
Yea because of it, you can actually feel time moving

629
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,100
I was surprised too

630
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,200
I'm sorry for this, it seems I have no choice

631
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,200
Eh? Now?

632
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,300
Eh for real?

633
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,100
But I really have no choice

634
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,400
It's alright if you press it though

635
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,700
Since it's from your place

636
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:26,600
But if I laugh or something because of that

637
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,600
By some big explosion, I'm gonna get really pissed

638
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,500
Please don't say that

639
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,100
It's really ridiculous

640
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,200
that it's gonna 'hurt pretty bad'

641
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,200
Here, look at the face he's making

642
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,100
You're breaking the rules there

643
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,600
Then shall I press it

644
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,900
Well if you feel like it

645
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:11,500
(Roulette START!)

646
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,500
You're kidding me!

647
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,800
This button is dangerous!

648
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,200
Nobody could have expected this

649
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,100
It's like a manga

650
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,200
Amazing

651
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,400
This is a really impressive system huh

652
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,400
Alright now there's no reason to push the button

653
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,700
Yea you're right

654
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,900
I was in a dangerous position too

655
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,600
Hold on, when is it gonna close?

656
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,600
I won't be able to tell the time like this

657
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,500
That incident wasn't funny at all right?

658
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,600
Yea

659
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,500
There's nothing in this one

660
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,100
Matsumoto-san, could you open your drawers?

661
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,300
Nothing

662
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:18,800
So if I open this one, it's considered that my area's cleared right?

663
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,500
Ah, thankfully nothing

664
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,400
Alright! With this I've done my part

665
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,400
Me too

666
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:34,700
Shall we?

667
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,900
Yea, just do it at your own pace

668
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,900
Ah it's ok

669
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,800
Something's inside

670
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,700
Waaahh..

671
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,800
(This time a yellow button appears)

672
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:01,100
Ah "Endou" is in yellow, and the button's also yellow

673
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,300
But Yamazaki's button is blue!

674
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,200
No when I pushed the button, the blue "Hamada" got an out

675
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,200
But there wasn't a red button for Matsumoto-san

676
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,700
But it wasn't in Matsumoto's desk

677
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,200
(Red button appears)

678
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,900
So this is Matsumoto's button

679
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:30,500
Nothing inside

680
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,600
Nothing inside?

681
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,600
So what does this mean?

682
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,400
I think there's no relation what-so-ever

683
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Wait look here

684
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,900
Pressing the red could be Matsumoto-san or it could mean something else altogether

685
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,300
Let's be certain

686
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,900
(Sweets fall from the ceiling)

687
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,500
Wait a minute

688
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,000
So the outcome was sweets huh

689
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,600
Should we try the yellow button?

690
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,100
What's up with this...

691
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:31,100
What an amazing device

692
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,900
Is this a reward? Sweets?

693
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,400
I don't get it

694
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,400
What's up with the sound it made when it came out

695
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,700
Like a "Buu"

696
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,300
He's laughing, he's laughing

697
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,300
That wasn't necessary!

698
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:58,000
I think an absolutely different thing will happen for Endou's

699
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,500
Yea maybe. I'm gonna do it OK?

700
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,500
Here I go

701
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,300
(Roulette START!)

702
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,300
Matsumoto was laughing

703
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,000
So what's the meaning of all this?

704
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,200
This means...

705
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,200
When Endou pushes the yellow button, thinking

706
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,400
"It's Endou, it's Endou"

707
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,200
it turned out to be Hamada-san

708
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,800
We've pushed them all, Hamada-san's was different

709
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,300
These two buttons yea?

710
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,300
This one was special(Red)

711
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:48,800
Then shall we press the red one again?

712
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,200
Shall I?

713
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:55,400
(Roulette START!)

714
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,600
What is this?

715
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,400
I don't really get what's going on here

716
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,100
What is this?

717
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,900
It's better to put these away

718
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,300
I'm putting them here

719
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,100
(Switch on)

720
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,000
You pushed it

721
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
You pushed it just then

722
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,600
I saw it too

723
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:41,300
(A photo drops from the ceiling)

724
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,200
This(photo) came out?

725
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,300
I didn't see it at all

726
00:50:49,400 --> 00:51:16,300
(Yonesuke 22years old)

727
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:52,900
You...

728
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,400
I haven't a clue who that is

729
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:07,400
Who is that?

730
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,800
Yonesuke-san

731
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:10,500
When he was young

732
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,200
A good-looking chap huh

733
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,100
How come?

734
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:33,700
Ouch

735
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,700
Ouch

736
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,700
Enough of this too

737
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:42,700
Put it away

738
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,000
Pretty merciless huh

739
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,500
Man... the worst has yet to come

740
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,700
It was pretty tough in the bus

741
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,000
Matsuko Deluxe yea?

742
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:09,700
And it wasn't just the pressure she gives alone

743
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,200
She was huge huh

744
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,700
Huuuge

745
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:14,800
Takada-san

746
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,300
Yamazaki-san also feels that it was a well-suited role right?

747
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,100
Yea

748
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,500
Everyone should work hard too, to achieve that standard

749
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,100
Work for dear life, body and soul

750
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,200
to achieve that standard

751
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,800
His legs went limp when he got off the bus

752
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,000
That Oowada-san

753
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,800
It wasn't an act right?

754
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,900
I was really surprised!

755
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,800
There's still more to come from here on

756
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:52,000
(Matsumoto-san,

757
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:52,000
-Cue Card)

758
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:52,000
please present the next video segment

759
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,300
Can't you stop this?

760
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,300
Nobody is looking forward to it

761
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,900
See, it was a bad response

762
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:10,900
This time there was a photo inside huh

763
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:14,400
It all started from this (CO2 gas)

764
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,800
I agree...

765
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:28,000
(Sudden outburst - Matsumoto)

766
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,600
This was something

767
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,400
I laughed because I remembered

768
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,500
This time it really hurts

769
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,600
Umm, can I have a little of your time

770
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,700
Uh... I forgot everyone...

771
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,900
Aah... I forgot to tell everyone something

772
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,200
There's a smoking area over there

773
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,700
Shall we have a look

774
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,000
Also, the scenery is beautiful

775
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:09,300
(Smoking area)

776
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:09,300
(Oowada, who got hunted down by the juveniles)

777
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,500
Oh, really pretty

778
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:21,700
(The members are oblivious to the existence of Oowada)

779
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:20,200
There's a Japanese martial arts hall!

780
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,670
(Discovery of Oowada)

781
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,670
Seconds

782
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:36,450
Dangerous dangerous dangerous

783
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:38,650
Man... I'm falling I'm falling!

784
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:39,650
Of all places to do this!

785
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:40,650
Careful careful careful

786
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:41,550
Shit! It's dangerous!

787
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:43,150
I'll fall getting it from here!

788
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:44,090
Ah! OW!

789
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,770
So he was caught after that incident huh

790
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:58,940
As I thought, he really did sprain his leg

791
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:00,240
He's dragging his feet

792
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:03,680
He's dragging them because of the strain

793
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:24,680
Yea doing it here's dangerous

794
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:32,370
We survived that huh, we could take it

795
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:36,240
This is frustrating~

796
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:51,960
Hamada, wanna go for a smoke?

797
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:53,830
This is tiring me out

798
00:55:57,270 --> 00:56:00,230
Until now, there has been no form of release for the members

799
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:03,470
With this, a sigh of relief

800
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,650
It's peaceful here eh?

801
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:19,750
This time

802
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:22,790
I think it's strange that my ass doesn't hurt that much

803
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:24,090
Instead my thighs, for one

804
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:26,490
Did they miss?

805
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:27,490
Sorry?

806
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:28,960
They did

807
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:29,760
Aaahn?

808
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:38,640
They missed totally, they got my thighs, or my back

809
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:57,430
Careful careful

810
00:56:57,430 --> 00:56:59,030
Yea I'm going I'm going

811
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:02,230
Again, Hamada-san with his "AaaHn?"..

812
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,170
Couldn't catch what I said?

813
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:12,000
No, it wasn't that I couldn't understand

814
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:34,300
(Sudden crashing noise)

815
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,500
Guys, bad news!

816
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,630
There was a loud noise coming from the rooftop

817
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:38,930
Like a huge roar, shall we go see?

818
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:55,980
(A scoop on the roof? What in the world...)

819
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:06,330
(UFO crash on the rooftop)

820
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:10,130
This is certainly amazing

821
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:17,140
(UFO Open!)

822
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:18,970
An alien is coming out!

823
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:38,090
(Alien? - Itao Itsuji)

824
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:44,000
Excuse me, are you an alien?

825
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,100
Haar?

826
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:51,140
The hell are ya sayin' huh!?

827
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:58,750
His ears are super evolved

828
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:09,790
But because you came out from a UFO...

829
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:11,990
I can't hear you at all

830
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:15,090
But you came out from a UFO didn't you?

831
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:19,730
But you came out from a UFO didn't you?

832
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:21,730
Yea so I did

833
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:24,030
You saw me come out so why da hell ya asking

834
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:24,730
"You came out didn't you?"

835
00:59:42,490 --> 00:59:44,790
Sorry, could we have a look at your teeth?

836
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:47,960
Why do you need to look at my teeth?

837
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,110
Well they're sharp aren't they?

838
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:51,710
It doesn't matter, particularly if they're sharp or not

839
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,710
Wait, isn't it difficult for you to talk?

840
00:59:57,710 --> 01:00:00,780
His face doesn't look right too huh?

841
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:11,950
Are you really not an alien?

842
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:13,450
FAR FROM IT!

843
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:31,170
There it is! Over there!

844
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:33,170
(Entrance of Earth Defense Corps)

845
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:37,710
Is everyone ok?

846
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:39,510
Nobody hurt?

847
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:43,350
That was without a doubt, a human possessed by an alien

848
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:50,660
As I thought, it really was an alien

849
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,860
Let's go shall we

850
01:00:54,330 --> 01:00:55,660
This is a first

851
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:08,680
The crows are crying

852
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:09,980
Why I wonder

853
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:11,380
In symphony

854
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:12,780
"Course"

855
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:14,850
There was a Japanese martial arts hall right?

856
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:17,100
Did you say "course"?

857
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:20,390
I was thinking about the crows' "course"

858
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:26,160
Because crows have a "course"

859
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,460
No they don't

860
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:32,060
Isn't "course" used for airplanes?

861
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,640
No, there were many reasons why I laughed

862
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,090
Hamada-san kept looking at me

863
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:43,440
Who's this guy!?

864
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:47,450
Full of energy huh

865
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:48,720
The guy's young

866
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:52,920
He joined NSC around last year or the year before

867
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:59,060
If he went to Volks(steak-house), he'd always be eating instead

868
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:19,380
So far, Yamazaki's in the lead yea? (Number of Outs)

869
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:22,780
To get whooped? That may be the case

870
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:27,120
From the start, it was "straight"

871
01:02:27,790 --> 01:02:30,060
I faltered at every single joke, how do I describe that?

872
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:31,560
"Straight" right?

873
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:33,960
Ah, It's "perfect"

874
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:49,040
Isn't making funny faces prohibited?

875
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:52,640
Isn't humor(amongst ourselves) prohibited?

876
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,140
Yama-chan, that was cheap just then

877
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:55,940
It was cheap and not just then

878
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:57,940
So why should funny faces be prohibited?

879
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:00,760
I have two evil reasons for that

880
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:05,160
People who are smiling, can trap others unknowingly, and 1 more reason

881
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,460
Accordingly, if you keep making funny faces

882
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:08,260
When you smile, it's as if you were trying to deceive

883
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:10,660
These double evils, are for me, latent

884
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:12,570
At... at least that's what I think

885
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:21,110
You should have said so directly

886
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:40,160
Absolutely no response yea?

887
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:44,360
If you're gonna lecture Yama-chan, then you shouldn't do it yourself

888
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:47,100
That's how I am when I'm in pain

889
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:51,310
When in pain, people can't make the correct decisions

890
01:03:51,310 --> 01:03:53,010
But you just...

891
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:54,110
This is in fairness

892
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:56,740
Everytime, as always, there's no reason to strike at each other right?

893
01:03:56,740 --> 01:04:01,540
My motivation now, is to get through this and say, "Aah... It's done"

894
01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:06,220
But this is just my personal opinion

895
01:04:06,790 --> 01:04:08,990
It's just an individual's opinion

896
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:20,970
In our newspapers

897
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:23,870
There's a popular corner for dinner recipes

898
01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:26,570
Incidentally, the chef is in the vicinity

899
01:04:26,570 --> 01:04:28,070
Let's go collect some data on the recipes

900
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:42,990
(Cooking Studio)

901
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:47,790
Sit accordingly - Tanaka, Endou, Hamada, Matsumoto, Yamazaki

902
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,260
First seat at the end - Tanaka

903
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:57,640
So then, sensei, if you would please..

904
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,680
Ehm, Gwood day~

905
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:04,780
(Culinary Lecturer - Sekine Tsutomu as Wajima Kouichi)

906
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:10,780
(Wajima Kouichi was a former boxing world champion known for his peculiar 'frog jump' uppercut)

907
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:11,920
For real?

908
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:22,360
Riiiight, that was a good punch but off a little eh?

909
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:23,800
I, Wajima,

910
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:26,630
Yes~, will be preparing the dish for today

911
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:27,570
Recipes yes?

912
01:05:27,570 --> 01:05:28,970
Jot this down eh?

913
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:31,240
Why do you need to take this down?

914
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,340
???

915
01:05:34,910 --> 01:05:38,150
Right, this is my assistant, Megumi-chan

916
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:40,180
She's the traditional round-girl with

917
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:43,750
? ? ?

918
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:44,650
Eh?

919
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:48,590
Just listening to him is hard

920
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:55,630
You can't tell what he's trying to say right?

921
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:02,440
Sensei, what were you trying to say just then? 'Round-girl'...

922
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,940
Sorry eh.. I'll stop

923
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:06,470
Sensei, so what are we preparing this time?

924
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:09,840
This time, it's a man's dish yea

925
01:06:11,310 --> 01:06:16,980
(Today's Menu - Pork and Tomato flavored stew)

926
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:18,180
Right, here's the frying pan

927
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:21,880
(Spread oil over frying pan)

928
01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:22,360
Putting the oil is dangerous eh?

929
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:24,980
When the oil splashes, you gotta defend yourself

930
01:06:39,210 --> 01:06:41,380
You gotta defend yourself

931
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,680
???

932
01:06:46,450 --> 01:06:53,120
(Tenderize the pork)

933
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:50,420
???

934
01:06:52,490 --> 01:06:53,820
Right, hold this for me

935
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:55,720
You gotta snap, snap!

936
01:06:58,030 --> 01:06:59,190
You can't do it slow

937
01:06:59,190 --> 01:07:01,400
If you do that, it'll be like...

938
01:07:12,870 --> 01:07:13,870
This cooking lecture...

939
01:07:23,550 --> 01:07:25,090
Could you please talk about the cooking itself?

940
01:07:25,090 --> 01:07:26,990
This here...

941
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:28,660
You can't pull your punches yea?

942
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:36,030
Will you please stop it

943
01:07:36,030 --> 01:07:37,330
This IS cooking right?

944
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:43,000
You can stop now, I get it already

945
01:07:47,010 --> 01:07:49,110
The pork's tenderized already

946
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:54,180
(Place the lid, so that it cooks well)

947
01:07:56,580 --> 01:07:57,950
Oh, the gong(bell) has gone

948
01:08:18,810 --> 01:08:19,810
It's done like this right?

949
01:08:21,070 --> 01:08:22,110
You have to do it standing no?

950
01:08:22,110 --> 01:08:23,640
This is how I thought up of the frog jump uppercut

951
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:24,950
I'll first make the opponent think I've disappeared

952
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:26,380
See, he can't get to me right?

953
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:28,380
Not even here

954
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:32,450
So what now? I jump up and "Biing~"

955
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:50,470
Ahh, thank you very much

956
01:08:50,970 --> 01:08:52,910
(Wajima Kouichi dinner recipe complete)

957
01:08:57,010 --> 01:08:58,850
How many blows was that?

958
01:08:58,850 --> 01:09:00,310
We were being force-fed

959
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:08,760
Itadakimasu

960
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:10,390
Itadakimasu

961
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:21,470
This is bad, my ass seriously hurts

962
01:09:21,470 --> 01:09:22,340
Seriously?

963
01:09:25,470 --> 01:09:26,940
The watchman...

964
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:28,980
...are not paying attention at all

965
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:34,080
(Sudden judgment on the programme)

966
01:09:35,850 --> 01:09:36,920
It's because of what you said

967
01:09:37,450 --> 01:09:38,720
Eh?! For real?

968
01:09:39,490 --> 01:09:40,620
You shouldn't have done that you know

969
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:44,190
It was an act of rebellion that's why

970
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:47,290
Wait, someone try saying something

971
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:49,900
I don't think so...

972
01:10:11,190 --> 01:10:13,190
Can we stop this?

973
01:10:21,130 --> 01:10:22,800
And I was enjoying my meal...

974
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:25,230
I've already been hit

975
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:35,980
You gotta stop it!

976
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:39,580
This chair isn't stable to begin with!

977
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:42,920
Well I wasn't the one who knocked it over

978
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:44,220
It was dangerous you know

979
01:10:46,650 --> 01:10:49,060
Even that kind of expression counts?!

980
01:10:55,930 --> 01:10:57,660
It's cuz you keep saying awful things

981
01:10:57,660 --> 01:10:59,100
You've made the watchman angry

982
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:02,340
You brought this on yourself

983
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:06,310
This chair is really scary

984
01:11:06,310 --> 01:11:07,610
Wasn't it really dangerous?

985
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:10,110
He almost knocked the back of his head

986
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:19,590
Please just let me have my meal. Please let me have my meal

987
01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:24,860
This guy's totally laughing!!

988
01:11:26,630 --> 01:11:29,160
Hamada-san's laughing!

989
01:11:31,530 --> 01:11:33,570
Uwaah... It's just the crows crying..

990
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:34,770
Oh he's laughing

991
01:11:34,770 --> 01:11:36,170
Yes he just did

992
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:40,840
Can you guys not do that? You were mistaken about earlier

993
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,840
Hamada-san, you started it first

994
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,740
No that's not it!

995
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:57,320
Doesn't it feel good doing that?

996
01:11:59,790 --> 01:12:01,330
Les' juz eat properly

997
01:12:01,330 --> 01:12:03,400
"Les' juz eat" he says

998
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:07,900
I think the watchman is kinda offended

999
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:10,870
Isn't the tempura a little bad? Sometimes

1000
01:12:11,270 --> 01:12:12,540
Right?

1001
01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:16,280
Man, do you only know how to complain?

1002
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:20,580
That was the worst

1003
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:37,130
??

1004
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:46,070
If even this is also a "Matsumoto OUT"

1005
01:12:46,610 --> 01:12:48,780
How do you expect me to escape huh?

1006
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,380
Somewhat, I,

1007
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:53,780
Naa!

1008
01:13:07,490 --> 01:13:09,060
Right, listen here

1009
01:13:10,330 --> 01:13:12,730
Noone...

1010
01:13:12,730 --> 01:13:16,470
.... can be bothered about this and just continues eating

1011
01:13:17,070 --> 01:13:20,270
"Playing it safe at any cost"... Kinda right, kinda wrong

1012
01:13:35,990 --> 01:13:38,660
Ahh it hurts it hurts it hurts

1013
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:45,370
This time round, finally you get to see Hamada go "Ah, it hurts it hurts"

1014
01:13:45,970 --> 01:13:49,570
No matter how painful it is, I never utter a word

1015
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:52,240
But probably...

1016
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:54,740
In the end it doesn't matter

1017
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:57,610
Sort of a cause for anxiety isn't it

1018
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:11,190
(Looking for something in Hamada's desk)

1019
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:23,070
(Yonesuke 22years old)

1020
01:14:20,370 --> 01:14:23,070
(Placed atop the seat cushion - standby)

1021
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:53,170
Who did this?

1022
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:05,310
Wasn't it supposed to be left here?

1023
01:15:13,650 --> 01:15:19,160
(Hamada goes to the smoking area)

1024
01:15:26,270 --> 01:15:30,800
(Placed atop the seat cushion - standby)

1025
01:15:26,270 --> 01:15:30,800
(Yonesuke 22years old)

1026
01:15:39,710 --> 01:15:42,550
(Placed under the seat cushion - standby)

1027
01:15:39,710 --> 01:15:42,550
(Yonesuke 22years old)

1028
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:28,300
There's a press release at another location

1029
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:31,100
Let's go collect some data

1030
01:16:40,210 --> 01:16:42,780
He didn't even say whose press release it is huh

1031
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:47,810
We'll be going by car. The car up front - Hamada, Matsumoto

1032
01:16:47,810 --> 01:16:51,010
Behind - Endou, Tanaka, Yamazaki

1033
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:57,860
We're in the middle of a war eh

1034
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:01,490
Eh!?

1035
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,230
I'm in the middle?

1036
01:17:04,230 --> 01:17:06,530
You should be in the middle

1037
01:17:05,330 --> 01:17:06,730
Sorry

1038
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:10,740
Why do I have to sit where the bulge is? It's not right ya know

1039
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:13,040
This guy's laughing

1040
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:23,550
You keep pushing and hogging space eh

1041
01:17:23,550 --> 01:17:26,750
Why are YOU pushing and hogging space!?

1042
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:28,350
WHAT THE HELL

1043
01:17:28,350 --> 01:17:30,250
You're taking up all the space!

1044
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,570
What the hell is this....

1045
01:17:46,270 --> 01:17:47,310
Oh it's taking place here huh

1046
01:17:47,310 --> 01:17:57,080
(Huge numbers of press members packed together - attention levels are high)

1047
01:17:47,310 --> 01:17:57,080
(Staged press release public interview)

1048
01:17:58,350 --> 01:17:59,450
Over here

1049
01:18:06,230 --> 01:18:10,660
(Press release - Hall)

1050
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:15,900
This place is huge huh

1051
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:23,280
Taking time off your busy schedules to come here,

1052
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:25,410
Everyone, really, thank you very much

1053
01:18:26,850 --> 01:18:29,350
Putting that aside, the great national theater will present to you this play,

1054
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:33,320
in celebration of its 25th anniversary.

The theme for the play is this -

01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:40,360
Stage Version - Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back

1057
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,500
They had to do a Star Wars play...

1058
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:49,840
Now, let me introduce the main cast of this version of Star Wars

1059
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:53,770
Playing as Luke Skywalker -

1060
01:18:55,710 --> 01:18:58,180

1061
01:19:17,430 --> 01:19:22,370

MEGURO YUUKI

1071
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,760
Wasn't the speed of which he came out just strange?

1072
01:20:25,670 --> 01:20:29,800
So, members of the press, please feel free to ask any questions

1073
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:31,800
(Question & Answer Session)

1074
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:38,550
I have a question for Claudia-san

1075
01:20:40,350 --> 01:20:43,620
Where is the one place that you would like to visit the most?

1076
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:46,820
Because I have alot to say...

1077
01:20:46,820 --> 01:20:48,320
I'll try to bring across my message properly

1078
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,660
My heart is racing

1079
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:52,390
Ah, it's ok, I'll help you in every way I can

1080
01:20:53,230 --> 01:20:55,660
Ah.. I wonder if doing so might anger Umemiya-san

1081
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:59,670
Thank you very much

1082
01:20:59,670 --> 01:21:01,670
That is all for the question & answer session

1083
01:21:01,670 --> 01:21:03,240
Still to come,

1084
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:07,710
we would like you to watch a special segment from the play

1085
01:21:07,710 --> 01:21:09,980
Please kindly wait

1086
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:19,450
They unveiled something really shameless eh

1087
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:54,690
He's really close

1088
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:06,630
Five minutes later

1089
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:19,210
Ten minutes later

1090
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:36,000
Eh wait this guy here's sorta laughing also

1091
01:22:41,230 --> 01:22:43,970
Ah, he's going back

1092
01:22:47,310 --> 01:22:49,710
That sort of gag is just terrible

1093
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:59,820
A long time ago, in a galaxy far away

1094
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:05,430
Under the reign of the dictator, Darth Vader,

1095
01:23:05,430 --> 01:23:08,030
Princess Leia has been held captive

1096
01:23:08,030 --> 01:23:10,460
At that time, Luke...

1097
01:23:24,510 --> 01:23:28,510
? I am Luke Skywalker ?

1098
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:34,850
? Protector of peace in space ?

1099
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:38,190
Master Luke!

1100
01:23:38,190 --> 01:23:40,130
What's wrong? C3PO?

1101
01:23:41,730 --> 01:23:44,400
I've learned the whereabouts of Princess Leia

1102
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,470
Let's save her at once

1103
01:23:47,830 --> 01:23:49,840
Let's go C3PO!

1104
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:52,670
Wait for me Master Luke!

1105
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:56,810
They're kidding right....

1106
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:59,280
Meanwhile...

1107
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:03,980
Princess Leia is being held captive by Darth Vader

1108
01:24:19,530 --> 01:24:21,570
Everything is going according to plan

1109
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:28,710
Release me. Release me.

1110
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:35,350
Absolutely no emotions at all

1111
01:24:36,620 --> 01:24:40,690
(Reading from script)

1112
01:24:40,690 --> 01:24:44,390
I knew it, this was all your doing

1113
01:24:47,830 --> 01:24:49,860
I... Aldar...

1114
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:52,700
She's just reading

1115
01:24:55,470 --> 01:25:00,370
Planet Alderaan's Princess Leia, descendant of Breha Organa

1116
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:03,810
This is a war

1117
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:06,280
A galactic war

1118
01:25:06,950 --> 01:25:09,180
In other words, star wars.

1119
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:13,890
Luke Skywalker, C3PO & R2D2

1120
01:25:13,890 --> 01:25:18,090
will surely come to save me

1121
01:25:18,090 --> 01:25:25,290
And then, by the hands of Luke Skywalker, C3PO & R2D2

1122
01:25:25,290 --> 01:25:27,390
I will be saved

1123
01:25:27,390 --> 01:25:33,090
Because Luke Skywalker, C3PO & R2D2

1124
01:25:33,090 --> 01:25:37,100
are my best partners

1125
01:25:40,250 --> 01:25:41,180
Miss Leia

1126
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:42,820
With that, are ya done?

1127
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:44,980
That's in Osaka dialect

1128
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:46,450
Take her inside!

1129
01:25:46,450 --> 01:25:52,630
Save me Luke Skywalker, C3PO & R2D2

1130
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,330
That was awful..

1131
01:26:00,330 --> 01:26:02,900
It's supposed to be their 25th anniversary right?

1132
01:26:03,870 --> 01:26:05,370
Meanwhile..

1133
01:26:05,370 --> 01:26:08,210
An intense mid-air battle unfolds

1134
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:12,810
as Luke and R2D2 linked up to fight enemy forces

1135
01:26:29,130 --> 01:26:32,170
What is this

1136
01:26:34,630 --> 01:26:37,670
Man.. What the hell is this

1137
01:26:40,770 --> 01:26:43,080
Let me go, you rude people

1138
01:26:46,550 --> 01:26:48,350
Eh you're pretty noisy aren't you

1139
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,250
Wait!

1140
01:26:57,490 --> 01:26:59,560
You're finally here, Luke

1141
01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:03,900
Let's battle with our sabers

1142
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,980
What an awful play

1143
01:27:18,210 --> 01:27:20,710
They're actually using toys for this

1144
01:27:20,710 --> 01:27:22,950
Look at Claudia, look at Claudia

1145
01:27:24,250 --> 01:27:26,450
She's just plain standing there

1146
01:27:34,230 --> 01:27:37,630
And so begun their grand struggle

1147
01:27:38,060 --> 01:27:44,070
And then manifested Luke's master, Yoda, who then pulverized Darth Vader

1148
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:48,440
Thank you Luke

1149
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:51,980
Where has C3PO & R2D2

1150
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:54,380
gone to I wonder

1151
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,220
You're right! Where could they have gone to?

1152
01:27:57,220 --> 01:27:59,450
Where I wonder

1153
01:27:59,450 --> 01:28:01,950
Where exactly, they were around earlier

1154
01:28:01,950 --> 01:28:03,950
Where I wonder

1155
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:06,790
Where I wonder

1156
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:09,830
Where I wonder

1157
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:12,770
Where I wonder

1158
01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:19,610
(Finally, R2D2 enters the scene)

1159
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:19,770
R2D2, are you alright?

1160
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:22,440
EH? Weren't you with C3PO earlier?

1161
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:26,480
pipopa i don't know pipopapipo

1162
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:31,250
Let's just leave C3PO be

1163
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:33,520
Oh what the heck

1164
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:49,970
? I was born for the sake of protecting the galaxy's peace ?

1165
01:29:01,950 --> 01:29:05,050
My stomach hurts my stomach hurts my stomach hurts

1166
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:32,980
It's gonna be a big hit, no doubt about it

1167
01:29:33,850 --> 01:29:34,650
Awful

1168
01:29:34,650 --> 01:29:37,150
All of them were just awful

1169
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:46,760
(Level 4 Lobby)

1170
01:29:47,530 --> 01:29:51,000
(Matsumoto goes to the toilet by himself)

1171
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:05,110
Ouch!

1172
01:30:05,110 --> 01:30:10,350
(Collision with a boy holding soft cream)

1173
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:15,720
Are you ok?

1174
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:17,020
Ryo-kun~

1175
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:18,290
MAMA!

1176
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:29,600
What happened?

1177
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:32,040
A boy was running,

1178
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:34,840
then he bumped into me and got soft cream on me

1179
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:38,210
His name was Ryo-kun right?

1180
01:30:38,980 --> 01:30:41,010
For a moment I thought

1181
01:30:41,010 --> 01:30:42,350
his father would appear

1182
01:30:42,350 --> 01:30:46,420
That father is Chouno-san, the guy who slaps your face

1183
01:30:47,790 --> 01:30:48,820
Wait a minute

1184
01:30:48,820 --> 01:30:49,620
Yamazaki, if you wish

1185
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:51,390
You can go to the dressing room to get a change of clothes,

1186
01:30:51,390 --> 01:30:52,460
since yours are dirty

1187
01:30:53,060 --> 01:30:54,790
Why are these here?

1188
01:30:59,530 --> 01:31:01,330
This time it's gonna be really harsh

1189
01:31:02,030 --> 01:31:03,700
The buttons huh

1190
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:06,370
Yama-chan is getting changed now right

1191
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:19,850
(Dressing room)

1192
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:18,820
While Yamazaki is changing

1193
01:31:19,620 --> 01:31:22,720
the respective members spend their time freely

1194
01:31:19,850 --> 01:31:22,290
(Smoking area)

1195
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:33,930
And Matsumoto is lonely all by himself

1196
01:31:39,470 --> 01:31:41,510
Those buttons are detestable

1197
01:31:42,270 --> 01:31:43,310
Is Yama-chan done changing?

1198
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:46,780
May I?

1199
01:31:48,950 --> 01:31:51,380
You should just come out if you're done

1200
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:03,230
You're a newspaper reporter right?

1201
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:17,310
You shouldn't say things like "You're a newspaper reporter right?"

1202
01:32:31,220 --> 01:32:34,190
Nobody asked you to wear something like this

1203
01:32:34,190 --> 01:32:35,790
It's like you're just trying to make us laugh

1204
01:32:35,790 --> 01:32:37,100
I'm not trying to be funny here,

1205
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:41,100
I'm not trying to be funny here, I'm really gonna catch a cold

1206
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:44,500
Then I guess it can't be helped

1207
01:32:47,170 --> 01:32:49,070
Do you mind...?

1208
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:50,910
Do you mind...?

1209
01:32:56,450 --> 01:32:58,180
What do you mean by "Do you mind?"

1210
01:32:59,050 --> 01:33:00,420
I don't know

1211
01:33:00,420 --> 01:33:02,020
What do you mean by "Do you mind?"

1212
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:04,320
Oh no.. This big guy

1213
01:33:09,130 --> 01:33:11,160
I have no idea what you're trying to say Yama-chan

1214
01:33:12,770 --> 01:33:14,400
There's no specific meaning to it

1215
01:33:15,170 --> 01:33:16,440
Do you mind.. This?

1216
01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:21,210
Do you mind...?

1217
01:33:26,450 --> 01:33:27,750
Do you mind...? For real..

1218
01:33:29,780 --> 01:33:31,880
What the hell...

1219
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:34,850
Why are you so persistent?

1220
01:33:34,850 --> 01:33:36,360
What's the meaning of all this?

1221
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:38,160
Just stop it

1222
01:33:44,060 --> 01:33:46,100
What do you want? Can you just say it?

1223
01:33:47,570 --> 01:33:48,430
Yea

1224
01:33:50,940 --> 01:33:52,640
You want me to hold it?

1225
01:33:57,580 --> 01:33:59,180
Heavy

1226
01:34:00,650 --> 01:34:03,020
Then you could've just said so in the first place

1227
01:34:03,020 --> 01:34:04,620
But you have to feel it for yourself to know

1228
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:06,220
But if you just said so in the first place...

1229
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:07,850
It's not something you'd expect you know

1230
01:34:08,420 --> 01:34:10,220
No need for this, it's heavy I know

1231
01:34:10,220 --> 01:34:11,820
Just a little, feel it for yourself

1232
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:20,670
The weight isn't something you'd expect right?

1233
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:28,670
There's reason to be seriously alarmed by this yea?

1234
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:37,280
Heavy..

1235
01:34:38,020 --> 01:34:42,720
??

1236
01:34:44,660 --> 01:34:46,490
I'll drink something hot

1237
01:35:02,540 --> 01:35:03,640
The buttons

1238
01:35:14,020 --> 01:35:15,250
I'm gonna press it

1239
01:35:15,790 --> 01:35:16,460
Seriously?

1240
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:18,720
Why am I the only one who's ok with it?

1241
01:35:21,330 --> 01:35:24,960
(Roulette START!!)

1242
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:37,580
Wait! Wait! This will hurt!

1243
01:35:42,180 --> 01:35:44,580
This definitely hurts!

1244
01:35:52,490 --> 01:35:54,860
Ah pain..

1245
01:36:13,780 --> 01:36:15,580
Kintaro-han, are you for real?

1246
01:36:17,180 --> 01:36:18,920
You'll be fine!

1247
01:36:19,490 --> 01:36:20,520
This is awful

1248
01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:23,660
But I'm just wearing a rag

1249
01:36:23,660 --> 01:36:25,460
The hit is direct on my ass

1250
01:36:25,460 --> 01:36:26,690
Eh? Guys, come here and have a look

1251
01:36:26,690 --> 01:36:27,890
Eh? Is it bad?

1252
01:36:27,890 --> 01:36:29,460
Nono, this underwear...

1253
01:36:29,460 --> 01:36:31,030
He didn't actually choose to wear this himself right?

1254
01:36:31,030 --> 01:36:33,000
Why are you wearing that kind of underwear?

1255
01:36:34,870 --> 01:36:36,840
C'mon please spare us!

1256
01:36:38,740 --> 01:36:41,010
Why are you wearing a T-back!? (G-string)

1257
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:46,010
Why are you wearing a T-back?

1258
01:36:49,850 --> 01:36:51,020
All of a sudden...

1259
01:36:51,780 --> 01:36:54,890
So why are you wearing a T-back?

1260
01:36:56,420 --> 01:36:57,920
...Why not?...

1261
01:37:00,130 --> 01:37:02,330
What if I've always been wearing them?

1262
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:05,700
You're kidding!

1263
01:37:11,370 --> 01:37:13,340
What's wrong with you!?

1264
01:37:22,050 --> 01:37:23,750
See!

1265
01:37:27,390 --> 01:37:28,950
That's bad, really

1266
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:33,360
It's bad, it's turned pink

1267
01:37:33,930 --> 01:37:36,090
This is definitely no laughing matter

1268
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:38,900
I'm gonna get chewed out for this...

1269
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:41,130
Who?

1270
01:37:48,170 --> 01:37:50,410
That was Tanaka!

1271
01:37:57,480 --> 01:37:58,950
Who's gonna scold you?

1272
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:05,420
Yama-chan, was this whooping as terrible as yours?

1273
01:38:05,420 --> 01:38:07,320
Mine was worse

1274
01:38:09,190 --> 01:38:10,830
Who's gonna get angry at you? Just curious

1275
01:38:10,830 --> 01:38:12,260
If...

1276
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:14,230
Blood or something gets out..

1277
01:38:14,230 --> 01:38:15,730
And stains the underwear, I'm gonna get scolded

1278
01:38:15,730 --> 01:38:16,730
Who's going to?

1279
01:38:16,730 --> 01:38:18,430
Everyone...

1280
01:38:18,430 --> 01:38:20,330
Everyone?....

1281
01:38:25,340 --> 01:38:27,880
Zaki-san, just be more careful

1282
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:33,720
Shall we try the blue button?

1283
01:38:35,950 --> 01:38:37,520
Waitwaitwaitwaitwait

1284
01:38:38,190 --> 01:38:39,860
You wanna press it?

1285
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:42,330
This one's done, I'll put it away

1286
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:44,860
Yea that one's taken care of

1287
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:48,870
Ah, Endou should push it

1288
01:38:50,370 --> 01:38:52,140
Here I go

1289
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:11,620
(Itao Itsuji's license)

1290
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:27,970
This did it! This button sure did it!

1291
01:39:28,970 --> 01:39:30,410
That was pretty awful yea?

1292
01:39:32,110 --> 01:39:33,580
This is the worst...

1293
01:39:34,050 --> 01:39:35,580
It's cold you know

1294
01:39:35,580 --> 01:39:37,320
You're gonna catch a cold

1295
01:39:41,790 --> 01:39:43,220
Maybe we could make a hot bath?

1296
01:39:43,220 --> 01:39:45,460
Nonono... I don't want that

1297
01:39:47,230 --> 01:39:51,230
??

1298
01:39:52,300 --> 01:39:53,930
I wonder if there's a dropper

1299
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:55,430
Wait.. Hamada-san

1300
01:39:55,430 --> 01:39:57,840
Really.. really.. I..

1301
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:00,310
I think Yamazaki is probably thinking..

1302
01:40:00,310 --> 01:40:03,440
that Hamada is up to no good

1303
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:06,240
Yes that's right, it's written all over his face

1304
01:40:07,210 --> 01:40:10,610
Wait wait wait.. no no no please

1305
01:40:35,640 --> 01:40:38,840
Yama-chan, that movement of yours is disturbing

1306
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:41,280
Nono, you're mistaken, I'm just getting a drink

1307
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:43,320
??

1308
01:40:44,620 --> 01:40:46,220
Ah there it is

1309
01:40:46,220 --> 01:40:47,520
Nonono, please wait a moment

1310
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:48,520
This is crazy isn't it?

1311
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:50,520
Wait guys, please just calm down

1312
01:40:51,660 --> 01:40:53,530
This is really ridiculous

1313
01:40:53,530 --> 01:40:55,530
Why??

1314
01:40:55,990 --> 01:40:58,000
You're mistaken, we were just thinking of

1315
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
putting the stove sideways so it'd warm the place up

1316
01:41:00,700 --> 01:41:01,700
Ohh I see

1317
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:04,070
I'm sorry

1318
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:15,450
You.. don't need this do you? You only need one cup right?

1319
01:41:16,010 --> 01:41:17,120
What's up with you?

1320
01:41:17,750 --> 01:41:18,580
Please stop..

1321
01:41:18,580 --> 01:41:19,480
Oh no...

1322
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:21,290
I can't trust anyone anymore

1323
01:41:21,990 --> 01:41:24,390
You're gonna drop the stove on my head aren't you?

1324
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:30,260
What's the point of dropping the stove on your head?

1325
01:41:34,030 --> 01:41:35,430
Yama-chan are you cold?

1326
01:41:35,430 --> 01:41:36,430
No I'm not

1327
01:41:36,900 --> 01:41:38,340
I'm fine

1328
01:41:40,210 --> 01:41:42,070
It's not a bad substitute for a pocket warmer

1329
01:41:42,070 --> 01:41:43,680
Nah, I'm absolutely fine

1330
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:47,850
Endou, the tea-bag(T-bakku) over there...

1331
01:41:48,310 --> 01:41:50,150
Isn't the T-back with you?

1332
01:41:50,150 --> 01:41:53,350
It's tea-pack(teii-pakku)

1333
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:12,400
(Stove)

1334
01:42:33,050 --> 01:42:34,690
I hate this

1335
01:42:36,850 --> 01:42:38,130
I hate this

1336
01:42:45,940 --> 01:42:52,140
Attending a party celebrating the establishment of a new office

1337
01:42:53,480 --> 01:42:54,710
Why is it like this?

1338
01:42:54,710 --> 01:42:57,750
Why do you always naturally end up getting in first?

1339
01:42:57,750 --> 01:42:59,450
Because I got here earlier

1340
01:42:59,450 --> 01:43:01,790
And you were behind...

1341
01:43:01,790 --> 01:43:04,110
...taking your own sweet time weren't you

1342
01:43:06,630 --> 01:43:08,660
That's sadly true

1343
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:27,610
(Party Hall)

1344
01:43:34,150 --> 01:43:37,820
Ladies and gentlemen, for taking time off your busy schedules

1345
01:43:37,820 --> 01:43:39,930
to attend this event, I honestly thank you

1346
01:43:39,930 --> 01:43:44,200
Now, an entertainment production, "Field of Butterfly",

1347
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:47,430
Let the party begin

1348
01:43:53,670 --> 01:43:56,740
Firstly, let's get this started with a ceremonial sake barrel breaking

1349
01:43:57,340 --> 01:44:00,350
You should remember this man, when celebrating the establishment of new offices

1350
01:44:00,350 --> 01:44:03,650
may we invite on stage, the barrel breaking expert!

1351
01:44:03,650 --> 01:44:07,020
(Barrel breaking expert enters)

1352
01:44:07,020 --> 01:44:10,560
(Egashira 2:50)

1353
01:44:36,010 --> 01:44:40,720
(the expert who's not breaking the barrel)

1354
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:02,270
It's my honor to split open the barrel

1355
01:45:02,270 --> 01:45:03,610
How's he gonna do it?

1356
01:45:06,580 --> 01:45:10,880
(Breaking the barrel by head-butting)

1357
01:45:17,620 --> 01:45:21,360
Allow me, to split open the barrel

1358
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:23,150
But you already did...

1359
01:45:30,740 --> 01:45:31,870
It's already open!

1360
01:45:31,870 --> 01:45:34,140
Oh no oh no oh no oh no!

1361
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:39,180
Th...thank you very much

1362
01:46:00,670 --> 01:46:02,030
Let's move on

1363
01:46:03,270 --> 01:46:07,240
(Debut of a member of the company)

1364
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:10,340
Presenting this gentleman, with his comical 'BIG 3' on stage!

1365
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:17,620
(Koji Tomita as Tamori)

1366
01:46:20,590 --> 01:46:24,490
In this world, there're many people with different bad habits right?

1367
01:46:25,820 --> 01:46:28,290
For example, Tunnels' Ishibashi-kun...

1368
01:46:28,290 --> 01:46:30,790
When he's trying hard to read off a message during filming

1369
01:46:30,790 --> 01:46:37,120
(Trying hard to read off a message - Ishibashi Takaaki)

1370
01:46:33,570 --> 01:46:37,400
Ooh this is good, extremely good

1371
01:46:38,740 --> 01:46:39,740
Thank you very much

1372
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,010
This here is...

1373
01:46:41,010 --> 01:46:42,310
Yokohama's...

1374
01:46:42,310 --> 01:46:51,220
???

1375
01:46:55,320 --> 01:46:58,820
Speaking of which, Bandou-san's Kansai dialect's intonation...

1376
01:46:58,820 --> 01:47:00,690
...is kinda wrong right?

1377
01:47:00,690 --> 01:47:05,930
(Weird intonation - Bandou Eiji)

1378
01:47:41,570 --> 01:47:45,370
Next we have this year's runner-ups for "King of skits"

1379
01:47:45,370 --> 01:47:48,040

(Nobu as Himura Yuuki)

1383
01:48:06,930 --> 01:48:08,690
Looks like the real thing!

1384
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:27,350
They were too similar. I mean I've watched them perform before

1385
01:48:36,050 --> 01:48:38,420
Ladies & gentlemen, thank you for waiting

1386
01:48:38,420 --> 01:48:41,190
This cute, 'elder sister' character who captivated many in no time at all

1387
01:48:41,190 --> 01:48:43,860
Getting her huge break from this year's Air Ayaya(Matsuura Aya)

1388
01:48:43,860 --> 01:48:46,490
Please get to know her, presenting..

(Nakamura P as Haruna Ai)

1390
01:49:10,020 --> 01:49:11,260
The clothes are awful

1391
01:49:27,640 --> 01:49:30,070
I've had enough of laughing

1392
01:49:30,070 --> 01:49:32,660
He(Nakamura P) sure practiced hard for this

1393
01:49:38,420 --> 01:49:39,850
Next, let's invite our next performer

1394
01:49:39,850 --> 01:49:41,320
More!?

1395
01:49:41,750 --> 01:49:43,560
Scouted from Europe,

1396
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:45,410
Presenting, this street dancer...

(Morisanchuu's Kurosawa Kazuko)

1398
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:58,270
What's up with that body!?

1399
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:07,010
That's some body..

1400
01:50:19,260 --> 01:50:23,260
(Longevity)

1401
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:23,330
That's the nastiest

1402
01:50:30,100 --> 01:50:31,800
Go die!

1403
01:50:33,270 --> 01:50:34,440
You're the worst!

1404
01:50:36,710 --> 01:50:39,110
It's to the extent that I would've rather laughed

1405
01:50:50,490 --> 01:50:51,590
Moving on,

1406
01:50:51,590 --> 01:50:54,790

(Chouno Masahiro)

1410
01:51:10,340 --> 01:51:11,380
OI!

1411
01:51:11,380 --> 01:51:13,230
The two officials over there, come up here!

1412
01:51:13,710 --> 01:51:16,510
Why was today's performances so weak?

1413
01:51:17,750 --> 01:51:19,680
Is that kind of standard OK for you?

1414
01:51:20,590 --> 01:51:21,890
Who was the one who gave you the instructions?

1415
01:51:25,660 --> 01:51:28,490
(Punished by a slap in the face)

1416
01:51:46,380 --> 01:51:50,080

(What crossed Yamazaki's mind - "Where has he seen this similar turn of events")

1419
01:52:01,530 --> 01:52:02,860

1420
01:52:04,160 --> 01:52:07,800
(No Laughing in Hospital)

1421
01:52:04,160 --> 01:52:07,800
(Recollection of exactly one year ago)

1422
01:52:08,470 --> 01:52:12,940
Dr. Chouno's most treasured handkerchief has been stolen

1423
01:52:13,710 --> 01:52:15,370
It's design is something like this

1424
01:52:16,540 --> 01:52:18,810
Everyone here please check your pockets

1425
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:23,080

(President Chouno's notebook stolen!!)

1430
01:52:43,470 --> 01:52:45,740
The stolen notebook looks identical to the one I'm holding

1431
01:52:46,370 --> 01:52:50,680
The culprit should be here in this room

1432
01:52:50,680 --> 01:52:54,080
(Escaped after much difficulty - Yamazaki)

1433
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:56,480
This isn't true right?

1434
01:52:56,480 --> 01:53:01,250
(Culprit found!!)

1435
01:53:01,590 --> 01:53:03,990
Hurry on up here!

I didn't steal the notebook you know

1441
01:53:20,240 --> 01:53:21,740
Did you look at what's inside?

1442
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:26,080
Are you trying to use that to blackmail me?

1443
01:53:26,680 --> 01:53:28,280
Well I've only been using it to collect data

1444
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:29,250

Do you remember how this person looks like?

1461
01:54:26,740 --> 01:54:27,870
Yea

1462
01:54:31,180 --> 01:54:32,540
The guy might be in here for all we know

1463
01:54:32,540 --> 01:54:34,310
Ryo-chan, see if you can find him here

1464
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:40,350
(Search for the culprit!)

1465
01:54:41,220 --> 01:54:42,620
Changing the look on your face might save you

1466
01:54:53,730 --> 01:54:54,830
It's him Papa!

1467
01:54:54,830 --> 01:54:58,470
(Culprit found!!)

1468
01:55:00,340 --> 01:55:02,610
Oi! Get up here!

1469
01:55:02,610 --> 01:55:08,050
(Culprit gets punished by a slap in the face!!)

1470
01:55:08,510 --> 01:55:09,950
Are you trying to oppose me!?

1471
01:55:11,180 --> 01:55:11,850
Please wait

1472
01:55:11,850 --> 01:55:13,380
Please Wait

1473
01:55:14,590 --> 01:55:15,650
Chouno-san..

1474
01:55:15,650 --> 01:55:18,090
I am truly very scared already

1475
01:55:18,820 --> 01:55:20,590
I'm really very scared

1476
01:55:25,930 --> 01:55:28,130
But you were the one who bumped into the kid earlier

1477
01:55:28,130 --> 01:55:31,800
How the hell did you knock into my kid for him to sustain such injuries!?

1478
01:55:32,270 --> 01:55:34,310
Wait wait! WAIT WAIT REALLY PLEASE

1479
01:55:36,540 --> 01:55:37,910
Your son....

1480
01:55:38,740 --> 01:55:39,910
He fell....

1481
01:55:40,440 --> 01:55:42,080
So I asked him if he was alright

1482
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:44,080
Why didn't you help him!?

1483
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:45,180
I DID!

1484
01:55:45,180 --> 01:55:46,800
How? Show me

1485
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:47,590
I said "Are you ok?"...

1486
01:55:48,750 --> 01:55:49,950
Then I sympathized with him

1487
01:55:52,520 --> 01:55:53,820
Come up here!

1488
01:55:54,590 --> 01:55:56,190
Wait, I really don't want this...

1489
01:55:56,600 --> 01:55:59,230
But we weren't the ones who knocked into the kid...

1490
01:56:04,070 --> 01:56:07,300
Then you should have made me the lead right from the start...

1491
01:56:09,470 --> 01:56:12,040
Wouldn't it be better if I was holding the notebook instead!?

1492
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:13,040
Are you trying to insult me!?

1493
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:14,750
I'm sorry! Wait!

1494
01:56:36,430 --> 01:56:39,800
Is this the only way? Please say it isn't true

1495
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:40,870
These are your circumstances

1496
01:56:40,870 --> 01:56:42,410
What do you mean?

1497
01:56:42,410 --> 01:56:44,780
If you can explain to me clearly, then...

1498
01:56:44,780 --> 01:56:47,140
OK I'll explain everything to you in detail

1499
01:56:47,140 --> 01:56:48,110
OK get started

1500
01:56:49,010 --> 01:56:50,750
I was walking normally

1501
01:56:50,750 --> 01:56:52,080
Then your child...

1502
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:54,790
....came running and knocked into me

1503
01:56:54,790 --> 01:56:56,820
It's because you didn't give way that it happened

1504
01:56:56,820 --> 01:56:58,120
I DID give way

1505
01:56:58,120 --> 01:57:00,360
But even then, he came knocking into me

1506
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:01,680
I was like, "Are you OK? Are you OK?"

1507
01:57:01,680 --> 01:57:03,830
Then how did my child sustain such injuries?

1508
01:57:03,830 --> 01:57:05,930
I have no idea

1509
01:57:22,910 --> 01:57:25,730
It seems you won't be persuaded huh....

1510
01:57:25,730 --> 01:57:27,350
Then let's do this oi!

1511
01:57:28,420 --> 01:57:29,950
What's up with you

1512
01:57:29,950 --> 01:57:33,450
What's wrong?

1513
01:57:34,130 --> 01:57:35,850
I'm scared....

1514
01:57:44,170 --> 01:57:46,340
Now you know how I feel don't you!!

1515
01:57:50,980 --> 01:57:54,110
You know I was really ecstatic when it turned out to be Tanaka

1516
01:57:54,110 --> 01:57:56,650
It can't be helped Zaki-san..

1517
01:57:58,850 --> 01:58:00,650
OK OK OK we'll do it we'll do it

1518
01:58:01,990 --> 01:58:03,190
OK we'll do it

1519
01:58:06,260 --> 01:58:08,030
Could you do it with a little bit of a warning..? A warning

1520
01:58:08,030 --> 01:58:08,760
What do you mean?

1521
01:58:08,760 --> 01:58:10,080
Well, that way, it won't hurt as much

1522
01:58:13,100 --> 01:58:14,370
But I haven't even moved yet..

1523
01:58:15,230 --> 01:58:16,800
Please, a little warning...

1524
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:21,840
Wait wait

1525
01:58:29,580 --> 01:58:31,580
My ass feels weird...

1526
01:58:42,190 --> 01:58:43,630
I don't feel so good...

1527
01:58:44,530 --> 01:58:46,030
Save me Tanaka

1528
01:58:47,260 --> 01:58:48,930
I don't feel so good anymore

1529
01:58:51,440 --> 01:58:53,900
Alright, let's get this over with

1530
01:58:58,310 --> 01:59:00,340
Say, "I am a bad person."

1531
01:59:00,340 --> 01:59:03,150
Say, "I'm sorry, I've been a bad person!"

1532
01:59:04,780 --> 01:59:06,480
Forgive me!!

1533
01:59:13,290 --> 01:59:19,560
(Moment of execution)

1534
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:18,800
Amazing huh!

1535
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,570
Yea! Stars were flying!

1536
01:59:24,940 --> 01:59:27,710
I've never experienced a slap like this before!

1537
01:59:39,750 --> 01:59:41,920
Show's over! Get out of here!

1538
01:59:42,190 --> 01:59:43,490
Get the hell out!

1539
01:59:43,790 --> 01:59:45,560
All of you get out!!

1540
01:59:57,470 --> 01:59:59,500
Ah... I just got it...

1541
01:59:59,740 --> 02:00:02,110
Field of Butterfly...

1542
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:04,480
is Chouno

1543
02:00:15,090 --> 02:00:16,120
Ah excuse me

1544
02:00:18,790 --> 02:00:20,590
Ah hello

1545
02:00:20,590 --> 02:00:24,600
(Unforseen visitor - Murakami Shoji)

1546
02:00:26,200 --> 02:00:27,630
Wah!!

1547
02:00:30,630 --> 02:00:33,540
I've been studying comedy inside a tiger's cave..

1548
02:00:34,470 --> 02:00:36,540
And I was picked up by the news

1549
02:00:38,810 --> 02:00:40,980
(Island)     .     (Roast pork)     .     (Everybody)

1550
02:00:38,810 --> 02:00:40,980
Kyushu   .   Charshu   .   Minnanoshu    Ha Ha

1551
02:00:56,530 --> 02:00:58,260
Can you stop going "Wahh"..

1552
02:01:05,870 --> 02:01:07,240
How did udon...

1553
02:01:07,240 --> 02:01:10,310
...gradually become popular

1554
02:01:10,310 --> 02:01:13,780
Udon is actually a product of China

1555
02:01:13,780 --> 02:01:16,180
How was udon discovered?

1556
02:01:16,180 --> 02:01:18,880
I'm sure everyone is familiar with Marco Polo

1557
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:21,650
Though in Kanji, it's written as Wantan

1558
02:01:22,650 --> 02:01:24,290
(Or rather, it's Y・ Tun)

1559
02:01:22,650 --> 02:01:24,290
But in Chinese, it's read Undon

1560
02:01:24,290 --> 02:01:26,060
So after going through different dialects and accents..

1561
02:01:26,060 --> 02:01:27,890
it gradually became udon

1562
02:01:27,890 --> 02:01:31,360
So in Kanagawa Prefecture..

1563
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:34,530
it appeared there, I don't know if you know this...

1564
02:01:34,530 --> 02:01:39,900
the truth is that, there was one time, Marco Polo...

1565
02:01:39,900 --> 02:01:42,900
...took it from China...

1566
02:01:56,850 --> 02:01:59,290
Then brought it back to Italy with him

1567
02:01:59,290 --> 02:02:04,030
Then presented it to the King

1568
02:02:04,760 --> 02:02:06,060
And he ate it

1569
02:02:06,330 --> 02:02:09,670
Uh.... uh...

1570
02:02:17,740 --> 02:02:18,940
Can you stop doing that with your hand?

1571
02:02:25,420 --> 02:02:26,880
Thank you very much

1572
02:02:32,790 --> 02:02:34,760
I knew it would go like that..

1573
02:02:37,360 --> 02:02:38,230
Guys

1574
02:02:38,230 --> 02:02:41,570
Now there's a wedding conference for a big celebrity.

1575
02:02:41,570 --> 02:02:42,670
Let's go collect data

1576
02:02:44,500 --> 02:02:46,870
Wow... one after another

1577
02:02:47,340 --> 02:02:48,370
Seriously?

1578
02:02:48,370 --> 02:02:50,140
News agencies sure are busy huh

1579
02:02:54,310 --> 02:02:55,550
It smells like winter huh

1580
02:02:55,710 --> 02:02:57,080
It doesn't matter, does it?

1581
02:03:01,450 --> 02:03:03,350
I'm just saying this...

1582
02:03:03,350 --> 02:03:05,720
Why? (being in the centre)

1583
02:03:06,060 --> 02:03:10,460
(On the way to a wedding conference in hired cars)

1584
02:03:06,060 --> 02:03:10,460
(Successive attacks from funny set-ups)

1585
02:03:11,430 --> 02:03:15,000
(Who could this big celebrity be?)

1586
02:03:17,330 --> 02:03:21,670
(The conference will turn into a comedic hell)

1587
02:03:22,570 --> 02:03:26,610
(A certain hotel, hall entrance)

1588
02:03:26,010 --> 02:03:26,980
Who is it?

1589
02:03:36,090 --> 02:03:37,620
This is the husband huh

1590
02:03:39,260 --> 02:03:41,530
Oh it's not a fellow big celebrity huh..

1591
02:03:41,530 --> 02:03:45,130
Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the delay

1592
02:03:45,900 --> 02:03:50,830
Please welcome the blessed wife onto stage

1593
02:04:10,820 --> 02:04:11,820
You're getting married?

1594
02:04:12,020 --> 02:04:15,330
(Chiaki is Endou's ex-wife, I believe they divorced in late 2007)

1595
02:04:12,020 --> 02:04:15,330
(Shocking wedding - Chiaki)

1596
02:04:15,330 --> 02:04:17,760
Is this for real!?

1597
02:04:21,330 --> 02:04:22,430
Thank you for having me

1598
02:04:22,470 --> 02:04:23,000
I'm Chiaki

1599
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:24,540
PuU~

1600
02:04:25,270 --> 02:04:32,740
Now we have the Q&A segment. To the journalists here, please feel free to ask questions

1601
02:04:33,310 --> 02:04:35,550
Yes, that gentleman over there

1602
02:04:36,610 --> 02:04:39,620
Chiaki-san, what do you usually call your husband?

1603
02:04:41,020 --> 02:04:42,490
Ummm..

1604
02:04:43,020 --> 02:04:45,890
(Affectionate name which means something like "Big brother")

1605
02:04:43,020 --> 02:04:45,890
For my ex-husband, I called him "Onii"

1606
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:49,330
For my current husband, it's "New Onii"

1607
02:05:05,810 --> 02:05:07,510
I feel like my ass is swelling

1608
02:05:07,980 --> 02:05:10,450
How did he propose to you?

1609
02:05:14,150 --> 02:05:15,950
For my ex-husband..

1610
02:05:15,950 --> 02:05:20,790
"I want to be with you even as you grow old"

1611
02:05:20,790 --> 02:05:22,660
For example, when it comes to death

1612
02:05:22,660 --> 02:05:25,000
To illustrate with soft cream...

1613
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:28,300
"You would be pink strawberry cream..

1614
02:05:28,300 --> 02:05:31,640
and I would be chocolate cream,

1615
02:05:31,640 --> 02:05:34,000
so that when they mix,

1616
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,540
they would also disappear together when they melt

1617
02:05:36,540 --> 02:05:38,510
similarly, if you die, I'll die with you."

1618
02:05:38,510 --> 02:05:39,910
...was what he said

1619
02:05:39,910 --> 02:05:41,950
For my current husband, it's the regular

1620
02:05:41,950 --> 02:05:43,810
"Would you marry me?"

1621
02:05:43,810 --> 02:05:46,480
This is amazing stuff, everything is exposed

1622
02:05:59,330 --> 02:06:03,170
Chiaki-san, what made you decide that he was the one for you?

1623
02:06:04,200 --> 02:06:06,100
Compared to my ex-husband,

1624
02:06:06,100 --> 02:06:08,140
he is absolutely unique

1625
02:06:09,270 --> 02:06:12,110
Sir, if you will, can you show us something interesting?

1626
02:06:12,110 --> 02:06:19,620
(New Onii showcasing something interesting)

1627
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:26,360
I'm really receiving every blow eh?

1628
02:06:35,330 --> 02:06:38,670
So gentle... patting his cheeks..

1629
02:06:56,950 --> 02:06:58,890
Actually I've heard that..

1630
02:06:58,890 --> 02:07:02,190
..you husband is exceptional at impersonations

1631
02:07:02,190 --> 02:07:03,430
Chiaki-san, is this true?

1632
02:07:03,430 --> 02:07:05,330
Yes, that's right

1633
02:07:05,330 --> 02:07:07,730
His impersonation of Beat Takeshi is rather good

1634
02:07:05,330 --> 02:07:09,730
("Beat Takeshi" Takeshi Kitano is a prominent Japanese celebrity)

1635
02:07:08,230 --> 02:07:10,400
Wow, then let's have a look

1636
02:07:10,440 --> 02:07:13,470
(Impersonation of Beat Takeshi)

1637
02:07:16,170 --> 02:07:18,280
Endou, you bastard!

1638
02:07:26,780 --> 02:07:28,850
You were made to say that weren't you?

02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:37,930
Chiaki-san, does he have anything else in stall for us?

1640
02:07:38,460 --> 02:07:40,360
His impersonation of Mori Shin'ichi-san is also excellent

1641
02:07:38,460 --> 02:07:42,360
(Mori Shin'ichi is an old Enka singer)

1642
02:07:40,360 --> 02:07:41,960

1646

That wasn't good at all!

1647
02:07:59,820 --> 02:08:01,550
What was he spouting?

1648
02:08:01,550 --> 02:08:03,390
He said 'mum'

1649
02:08:06,220 --> 02:08:10,630
(Mori Shin'ichi had a dispute with the late composer, Kohan Kawauchi, over the song "Ofukuro-san", or "Dear Mother", for changing the lyrics. It has since been settled)

1650
02:08:07,220 --> 02:08:08,630
It's supposed to be 'dear mother' right?

1651
02:08:10,630 --> 02:08:13,700
So next, to the journalists seated in the front row..

1652
02:08:13,700 --> 02:08:17,670
whose impersonation would you like to see?

1653
02:08:17,670 --> 02:08:21,240
Please make a request with the celebrity's name

1654
02:08:21,240 --> 02:08:24,570
So, could we have Yamazaki-san make a request?

1655
02:08:26,140 --> 02:08:28,280

No! No! No!

1819
02:24:33,080 --> 02:24:35,810
There was no need to do that right?

1820
02:24:46,520 --> 02:24:48,760
There was really no need to do that right?

1821
02:24:56,330 --> 02:25:00,370
(Iwao Nozomu)

1822
02:24:56,330 --> 02:25:00,370
(Ogi Hiroaki)

1823
02:25:10,080 --> 02:25:11,780
That's good taking him from the back

1824
02:25:11,780 --> 02:25:12,480
That's right that's right!

1825
02:25:30,230 --> 02:25:31,300
Eh? What's going on?

1826
02:25:31,300 --> 02:25:32,470
This isn't right!

1827
02:25:57,330 --> 02:25:59,930
That was mortifying

1828
02:26:22,890 --> 02:26:25,190
In the end, it was nothing but his anus

1829
02:26:25,650 --> 02:26:27,160
He was totally nude huh?

1830
02:26:27,160 --> 02:26:29,330
Why are they going back as if they've accomplished something?

1831
02:27:01,560 --> 02:27:03,330
I would like to begin the "Regular Report" Meeting

1832
02:27:03,930 --> 02:27:10,200
(The journalists will exchange their inside stories/reports)

1833
02:27:09,970 --> 02:27:12,940
Firstly Yoshimoto Kogyo's talent,

1834
02:27:09,970 --> 02:27:15,200
(I apologize, I believe most of this segment is translated wrongly)

1835
02:27:12,940 --> 02:27:15,640
Yamazaki Housei... any stories on him?

1836
02:27:18,540 --> 02:27:20,580
Umm.. About that guy..

1837
02:27:20,580 --> 02:27:24,110
Something disastrous happened

1838
02:27:30,090 --> 02:27:31,790
He was staying over at an inn in the countryside

1839
02:27:31,790 --> 02:27:33,590
For a TV program

1840
02:27:33,690 --> 02:27:35,390
- Right, TV Tokyo.        -Ah, that's right.

1841
02:27:35,390 --> 02:27:38,760
So one morning...

1842
02:27:38,760 --> 02:27:40,500
I wanted to go meet him

1843
02:27:40,500 --> 02:27:43,600
But it's like Yamazaki just refused to.

1844
02:27:43,600 --> 02:27:48,770
So Yamazaki kept rejecting

1845
02:27:48,770 --> 02:27:51,140
One of the reasons he gave was

1846
02:27:52,540 --> 02:27:54,910
"He was sleeping at a stranger's place"

1847
02:28:02,020 --> 02:28:04,320
From one's knowledge you'd know he wasn't at a stranger's place and yet...

1848
02:28:04,320 --> 02:28:05,390
But then the next morning came..

1849
02:28:05,390 --> 02:28:07,660
"That's no reason to cry"

1850
02:28:08,160 --> 02:28:12,600
So then after, he did leave the place

1851
02:28:12,960 --> 02:28:15,830
For some time, I discussed the matter with the staff

1852
02:28:15,830 --> 02:28:18,970
You'd get disoriented due to the time-difference

1853
02:28:18,970 --> 02:28:22,810
The regular guests cried twice as much

1854
02:28:24,810 --> 02:28:26,310
That's mean

1855
02:28:26,640 --> 02:28:28,940
Every time I greet him my heart goes...

1856
02:28:33,350 --> 02:28:35,020
He supposedly causes miracles to happen doesn't he?

1857
02:28:35,020 --> 02:28:37,120
With Ameagari-san,

1858
02:28:35,020 --> 02:28:41,490
(Ameagari Kesshitai is a comedy duo)

1859
02:28:37,120 --> 02:28:39,490
they went for the written oracles (fortune-telling)

1860
02:28:39,490 --> 02:28:41,060
Miyasako-san got slightly good luck

1861
02:28:41,060 --> 02:28:42,960
Hotohara-san got moderate good luck

1862
02:28:43,990 --> 02:28:46,860
But Yamazaki-san got a blank piece of paper

1863
02:28:48,700 --> 02:28:50,600
So everyone was like, "Wow that's amazing!"

1864
02:28:50,600 --> 02:28:52,800
Then later with a friend, I messaged Yamazaki-san

1865
02:28:52,800 --> 02:28:55,170
to ask where he was

1866
02:28:55,170 --> 02:28:57,610
And later proceeded to the get written oracles too

1867
02:28:57,610 --> 02:28:59,940
I got slightly good luck

1868
02:28:59,940 --> 02:29:02,180
the friend got moderate good luck

1869
02:29:02,180 --> 02:29:03,710
When Yamazaki-san drew his lot...

1870
02:29:03,710 --> 02:29:05,080
there was no need for a second look

1871
02:29:05,080 --> 02:29:09,080
on it was written "Plain"

1872
02:29:33,280 --> 02:29:38,180
Recently, Yamazaki-san got into the iPod

1873
02:29:39,150 --> 02:29:42,150
There were various things you could do with it

1874
02:29:42,150 --> 02:29:44,960
Editing sceneries, photos or even music... it's all in

1875
02:29:44,960 --> 02:29:47,160
So he was showing some juniors his pictures

1876
02:29:47,160 --> 02:29:50,730
He was showing this photo to Kobayashi

1877
02:29:50,730 --> 02:29:52,160
So holding his iPod like so...

1878
02:29:52,160 --> 02:29:56,470
Caught in the nail of his pinky was a strand of pubic hair

1879
02:29:59,770 --> 02:30:01,300
Was that true?

1880
02:30:10,550 --> 02:30:12,480
Pubic hair huh...

1881
02:30:14,820 --> 02:30:17,420
Regarding the boom of his shophouse home

1882
02:30:18,650 --> 02:30:22,160
He wanted to turn it into...

1883
02:30:22,560 --> 02:30:25,230
A shop specializing in Yakisoba

1884
02:30:31,570 --> 02:30:34,440
-

1885
02:30:34,870 --> 02:30:38,010
He then hired a chinese guy from the mahjong club

1886
02:30:39,110 --> 02:30:42,340
He wanted to a start a store specializing in fried rice.

1887
02:30:55,920 --> 02:30:59,330
He wanted me to teach him how to headhunt for people

1888
02:31:00,460 --> 02:31:02,830
The guy likes to blow his nose alot doesn't he?

1889
02:31:00,460 --> 02:31:09,710
(Haven't the slightest what this joke is, sorry.)

1890
02:31:04,430 --> 02:31:06,770
He rips off from Koike Eikoe

1891
02:31:06,770 --> 02:31:09,710
Saying, "Chan is 'clip-clop'".

1892
02:31:12,210 --> 02:31:14,010
For real?

1893
02:31:14,010 --> 02:31:16,550
Are all these stories real you guys?

1894
02:31:41,710 --> 02:31:43,340
Any other news?

1895
02:31:43,340 --> 02:31:45,410
Something like scandals?

1896
02:31:45,910 --> 02:31:50,180
I just got this news though

1897
02:31:52,110 --> 02:31:53,720
Just recently at the wrestling club..

1898
02:31:55,080 --> 02:31:57,820
Shoufukutei Shouhei was there wasn't he?

1899
02:31:57,820 --> 02:31:59,590
I helped him with his costumes yes?

1900
02:31:59,590 --> 02:32:03,160
So when I did, I noticed his pubes were all white.

1901
02:32:14,170 --> 02:32:16,640
What kind of conversation is this?!

1902
02:32:29,550 --> 02:32:32,220
This is about Miyasko Hiroyuki during his lowest

1903
02:32:32,220 --> 02:32:37,190
He claimed "I'm as interesting as Downtown".

1904
02:32:34,740 --> 02:32:37,000
(This is Miyasako Hiroyuki)

1905
02:32:48,500 --> 02:32:50,770
And despite saying that....

1906
02:32:52,070 --> 02:32:55,440
Now even though he's actually earning quite a sum of money,

1907
02:32:55,440 --> 02:32:59,110
He admitted, "My honeymoon was on the sandy beaches of Wakayama".

1908
02:33:01,880 --> 02:33:03,920
There's nothing wrong with that really.

1909
02:33:13,030 --> 02:33:15,330
Furthermore, he went by express train.

1910
02:33:18,130 --> 02:33:19,570
But its suitable for working class people

1911
02:33:20,570 --> 02:33:22,300
But its suitable for working class people right?

1912
02:33:26,010 --> 02:33:28,810
This is about Downtown's Hamada Masatoshi

1913
02:33:29,480 --> 02:33:31,480
He doesn't just do comedy does he

1914
02:33:31,480 --> 02:33:33,150
There are dramas and movies too

1915
02:33:33,150 --> 02:33:34,920
Also as a voice actor yes?

1916
02:33:34,920 --> 02:33:36,820
Like in Shrek...

1917
02:33:39,320 --> 02:33:44,490
So he casted as Shrek, which was suitable with his Kansai dialect

1918
02:33:45,730 --> 02:33:49,000
And Fujiwara Norika...

1919
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:53,100
Though was quite compatible, casting as his female companion,

1920
02:33:53,100 --> 02:33:55,440
and they've co-starred quite a number of times before.

1921
02:33:55,440 --> 02:33:56,970
I daresay that at least once...

1922
02:33:57,070 --> 02:34:00,210
He carried her in his arms

1923
02:34:07,720 --> 02:34:09,820
Who's earning from all this!?

1924
02:34:23,530 --> 02:34:28,040
-

1925
02:34:28,040 --> 02:34:31,070
Jinnai was worried about his physical condition

1926
02:34:29,860 --> 02:34:32,010
(This is Jinnai Tomonori)

1927
02:34:31,070 --> 02:34:35,340
It was said he had problems with his stomach, according to reports

1928
02:34:35,610 --> 02:34:38,080
In the dressing room, he was eating pastries

1929
02:34:38,080 --> 02:34:40,580
And all of a sudden, he vomited.

1930
02:34:40,620 --> 02:34:42,080
When asked "what's wrong?"

1931
02:34:42,080 --> 02:34:46,460
He said, "Oh no, I forgot I'm already full."

1932
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:57,600
Why do I have to get my ass whooped from your lying!?

1933
02:35:06,310 --> 02:35:09,810
-

1934
02:35:11,410 --> 02:35:12,750
Some time back...

1935
02:35:16,990 --> 02:35:20,460
During that time, there was an event late in the night.

1936
02:35:21,120 --> 02:35:23,690
Everyone was sharing scary stories

1937
02:35:25,730 --> 02:35:28,400
Then all of sudden, Jinnai turned pale...

1938
02:35:28,400 --> 02:35:29,730
and broke into cold sweat.

1939
02:35:29,730 --> 02:35:31,970
saying, "It's cold, it's cold.."

1940
02:35:31,970 --> 02:35:34,640
As if he was in his final moments.

1941
02:35:34,640 --> 02:35:37,340
And then Tamura Keiji (another celebrity)...

1942
02:35:37,340 --> 02:35:40,110
when he saw this, he started hitting Jinnai's back

1943
02:35:40,910 --> 02:35:44,010
(looks like an exorcism ritual)

1944
02:35:44,510 --> 02:35:47,050
Jinnai was healed.

1945
02:36:01,030 --> 02:36:05,000
There are some reports associating Jinnai with Kobayashi Kendo right?

1946
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:09,670
From my info, it's known that Kendo Kobayashi was quite the prankster.

1947
02:36:07,480 --> 02:36:09,770
(This is Kendo Kobayashi)

1948
02:36:11,440 --> 02:36:15,040
There were pranks done to Jinnai's glasses

1949
02:36:16,350 --> 02:36:18,880
???

1950
02:36:18,880 --> 02:36:22,850
So what happened was that the glasses were stir-fried in a fry pan

1951
02:36:24,550 --> 02:36:28,120
He said, "Don't just use the gas as you please!"

1952
02:36:40,100 --> 02:36:43,000
Normally you'd say, "What are you doing to my glasses!" and get angry

1953
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:46,210
But he reacted to the gas being used instead huh

1954
02:36:50,010 --> 02:36:51,210
What about the rest?

1955
02:36:54,550 --> 02:36:57,950
This is from Mimata Matazou the celebrity

1956
02:37:00,020 --> 02:37:02,720
About Takeshi and Hitoshi, both of whom he's acquainted with

1957
02:37:02,720 --> 02:37:04,960
At Matsumoto Hitoshi's household,

1958
02:37:04,960 --> 02:37:07,230
The paparazzi was constantly snooping around.

1959
02:37:10,730 --> 02:37:13,370
This is something I heard from others who saw it.

1960
02:37:13,370 --> 02:37:19,410
As mentioned earlier, Matsumoto was having a meal with his other Yoshimoto colleagues

1961
02:37:19,580 --> 02:37:22,010
Then Matsumoto Hitoshi-san...

1962
02:37:22,040 --> 02:37:27,280
he went to Dyson the next day, with the intention of buying a vacuum cleaner

1963
02:37:27,280 --> 02:37:34,760
The person there said, "I have a Dyson cleaner that's been used only twice."

1964
02:37:34,760 --> 02:37:38,790
So Matsumoto said, "I'll take it".

1965
02:37:38,790 --> 02:37:42,960
From what I know, he then had it delivered to his Yoshimoto junior.

1966
02:37:46,230 --> 02:37:48,600
It was well-received.

1967
02:37:48,600 --> 02:37:50,240
"Thanks for the vacuum cleaner"

1968
02:37:50,240 --> 02:37:51,910
Text messages as well.

1969
02:37:51,910 --> 02:37:55,410
He even received calls like, "Thank you so much."

1970
02:37:57,150 --> 02:38:00,520
Then he was like, "What good manners he has, he must be a good person"

1971
02:38:13,460 --> 02:38:16,730
As was said earlier, what did the "twice" stand for?

1972
02:38:16,450 --> 02:38:17,130
-The times it was used

1973
02:38:17,130 --> 02:38:20,770
Right, just twice. Doesn't it concern you? What those 2 times were used for?

1974
02:38:22,900 --> 02:38:25,610
According to investigations..

1975
02:38:25,610 --> 02:38:29,210
it was used to suck the anus

1976
02:38:33,920 --> 02:38:36,850
But the person in question doesn't seem to know about it does he?

1977
02:38:41,060 --> 02:38:44,760
So you're saying he didn't know what it was being used for?

1978
02:38:44,760 --> 02:38:47,060
Right he just thought that the cleaner being used only twice was a good thing

1979
02:38:58,340 --> 02:38:59,710
Any more?

1980
02:38:59,710 --> 02:39:02,710
Last week there was a report on Matsumura Kunihiro..

1981
02:39:02,710 --> 02:39:07,150
(I believe it's masturbation)

1982
02:39:02,710 --> 02:39:07,150
about his ****** incident.

1983
02:39:11,450 --> 02:39:14,760
He fell in love with someone in the sports club

1984
02:39:14,760 --> 02:39:18,990
A 64 year old woman that he met

1985
02:39:18,990 --> 02:39:21,060
Every Monday and Friday

1986
02:39:21,060 --> 02:39:25,630
Twice a week, in the locker rooms, he'd ******.

1987
02:39:50,660 --> 02:39:52,730
(Someone asking Mimata Matazou...)

1988
02:39:53,700 --> 02:39:56,330
...asked him if he had any interesting stories to tell

1989
02:39:57,570 --> 02:40:00,100
Then he said, "I'm going out with Idol A's mother".

1990
02:40:09,280 --> 02:40:11,310
(This is Mimata Matazou)

1991
02:40:18,850 --> 02:40:20,490
That Mimata,

1992
02:40:20,490 --> 02:40:22,520
at 4am in Roppongi Sushi,

1993
02:40:22,520 --> 02:40:26,160
was having a lover's quarrel with Actress A

1994
02:40:42,280 --> 02:40:44,550
After thorough investigations

1995
02:40:44,550 --> 02:40:47,650
the 4th date he had was with someone new

1996
02:40:49,780 --> 02:40:53,990
Even though until now he still has prostitute's panties, I believe... (not sure about this)

1997
02:40:54,390 --> 02:40:56,690
Later it was found out there was a third party involved.

1998
02:40:56,690 --> 02:40:59,690
When **** introduced them to each other,

1999
02:40:59,690 --> 02:41:02,430
it turned out to be Yamashiro Shingo-san

2000
02:41:01,430 --> 02:41:04,430
(Yamashiro Shingo is an old actor. Around 70 years of age.)

2001
02:41:20,080 --> 02:41:22,520
This is the best story

2002
02:41:24,050 --> 02:41:25,250
So shall we go with this?

2003
02:41:25,250 --> 02:41:30,060
Big actress A introduces Yamashiro Shingo to him

2004
02:41:25,250 --> 02:41:30,060
Morning paper headlines - Mimata's 4th date!!

2005
02:41:33,290 --> 02:41:35,060
Dismiss~

2006
02:41:47,680 --> 02:41:48,880
I can't take in anymore

2007
02:41:54,620 --> 02:41:57,520
In our news agency, we have horror department duties.

2008
02:41:57,520 --> 02:41:59,920
The duties start at this time

2009
02:41:59,920 --> 02:42:01,920
Would you guys like to help out?

2010
02:42:01,920 --> 02:42:04,630
Aww maan....

2011
02:42:05,060 --> 02:42:07,760
The room is in basement 1.

2012
02:42:07,760 --> 02:42:09,560
But I'm not going, because I'm scared.

2013
02:42:09,560 --> 02:42:11,170
What the hell?

2014
02:42:11,170 --> 02:42:14,070
In any case, from here on, it's OK to laugh,

2015
02:42:14,070 --> 02:42:15,700
But it's an 'out' if you get scared.

2016
02:42:15,700 --> 02:42:17,410
Here we go..

2017
02:42:18,640 --> 02:42:19,770
Excuse me,

2018
02:42:20,540 --> 02:42:23,240
I don't wanna be with Tanaka in this case

2019
02:42:24,880 --> 02:42:27,680
Anything strange would be enough to scare him

2020
02:42:28,120 --> 02:42:33,690
(Late night special rule)

2021
02:42:29,750 --> 02:42:33,690
(No getting frightened news agency)

2022
02:42:44,100 --> 02:42:48,200
(Illumination within the building has changed)

2023
02:42:48,200 --> 02:42:50,440
Tanaka, it's scarier at the back.

2024
02:42:50,440 --> 02:42:52,310
Right, you should stay in front, it's definitely better

2025
02:42:52,310 --> 02:42:55,080
OK, please walk behind me then.

2026
02:42:55,410 --> 02:42:59,150
(Toaster)

2027
02:43:05,420 --> 02:43:07,720
Tanaka with his reaction...

2028
02:43:07,720 --> 02:43:09,790
Stop that will you

2029
02:43:10,590 --> 02:43:12,330
I think he landed on his knee

2030
02:43:12,330 --> 02:43:13,260
Keep it together will ya

2031
02:43:16,900 --> 02:43:20,840
(Heipo scream)

2032
02:43:26,910 --> 02:43:28,210
What the hell

2033
02:43:28,210 --> 02:43:29,740
What the hell are ya doing?

2034
02:43:29,740 --> 02:43:31,610
Tanaka are you dead?

2035
02:43:34,150 --> 02:43:37,820
If a person's voice is your limit then there's something wrong with you

2036
02:43:39,390 --> 02:43:44,060
(Carefully sweeping across the basement towards their destination)

2037
02:43:44,860 --> 02:43:50,130
(What will the horror dept. have them do?)

2038
02:43:52,730 --> 02:43:54,800
Ah here we are! The horror dept.

2039
02:43:54,800 --> 02:43:56,600
Endou, you're a little too loud

2040
02:44:12,520 --> 02:44:18,260
(Farewell letter)

2041
02:44:12,660 --> 02:44:18,260
Sit and wait

2042
02:44:22,260 --> 02:44:24,430
Absolutely no manners huh...

2043
02:44:22,260 --> 02:44:25,530
(Horror department member)

2044
02:44:42,720 --> 02:44:43,990
Hello

2045
02:44:43,990 --> 02:44:47,720
I'm looking for someone from the horror department

2046
02:44:47,720 --> 02:44:49,720
Endou-san

2047
02:44:53,060 --> 02:44:54,200
Endou speaking

2048
02:44:54,860 --> 02:44:58,730
Hello, I have a request.

2049
02:45:00,070 --> 02:45:02,170
In the archives on the 3rd floor

2050
02:45:02,170 --> 02:45:06,170
There are 3 portraits on display

2051
02:45:06,170 --> 02:45:10,410
Please take photos of these portraits

2052
02:45:10,580 --> 02:45:13,180
so that the spirit will be caught

2053
02:45:14,120 --> 02:45:18,190
Endou-san and Yamazaki-san

2054
02:45:18,190 --> 02:45:22,520
would you be so kind as take the spirit photographs?

2055
02:45:23,420 --> 02:45:26,190
The archives on the 3rd floor

2056
02:45:26,360 --> 02:45:28,330
There are 3 portraits

2057
02:45:28,330 --> 02:45:32,870
If their photos are taken, we'll have ourselves spirit photos.

2058
02:45:32,870 --> 02:45:37,640
This was requested of Yamazaki-san and myself

2059
02:45:37,640 --> 02:45:39,340
You're kidding!

2060
02:45:40,040 --> 02:45:42,580
Portrait photos and Shouzou ... complicatedly related.

2061
02:45:40,040 --> 02:45:45,580
('Portrait' and Endou's given name are pronounced the same = Shouzou)

2062
02:45:57,930 --> 02:46:02,100
(Discharging of CO2 gas)

2063
02:46:05,500 --> 02:46:07,570
This would definitely scare anyone

2064
02:46:16,110 --> 02:46:19,110
(2 meter tall Kitarou)

2065
02:46:25,550 --> 02:46:27,220

2067
02:46:39,630 --> 02:46:40,840

That head...

2072
02:46:56,220 --> 02:46:59,550
Don't worry~

2073
02:46:59,550 --> 02:47:01,890
This IS worrisome

2074
02:47:01,890 --> 02:47:08,700
(The echoes of the 2 screaming men)

2075
02:47:05,890 --> 02:47:08,030
They're really noisy

2076
02:47:09,400 --> 02:47:12,200
You can hear them all the time

2077
02:47:17,270 --> 02:47:17,940
I'm sorry!

2078
02:47:19,040 --> 02:47:20,340

2083
02:48:12,490 --> 02:48:14,060

Housei-san (Yamazaki), please sign.

2085
02:48:24,170 --> 02:48:25,510
It'll be OK if you use your sleeves

2086
02:48:39,750 --> 02:48:42,220
It's really painful and scary you know

2087
02:48:45,260 --> 02:48:46,930
It's fine even if we don't write anything

2088
02:49:14,060 --> 02:49:15,720

You guys sure were noisy

2103
02:51:13,570 --> 02:51:15,410

(Snakes from the ceiling)

2105
02:51:26,020 --> 02:51:27,820
That scared me!

2106
02:51:28,020 --> 02:51:29,260
Were there instances like this one?

2107
02:51:29,260 --> 02:51:32,430
This is nothing.

Why did Sento-kun enter all of a sudden?

I have to bring back spirit photos from a mountain nearby

2171
02:58:28,680 --> 02:58:29,880
Where where?

2172
02:58:29,880 --> 02:58:32,580
There's a car waiting for me by the entrance

2173
02:58:33,050 --> 02:58:34,350
Eh? You're kidding

2174
02:58:35,120 --> 02:58:40,850
There will be a coordinator dressed in a red hood waiting for you there

2175
02:58:45,190 --> 02:58:48,200
What's wrong? You looked like a sardine can

2176
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:53,500
Your legs are bad so be careful

2177
02:58:58,410 --> 02:59:00,740
Doing this alone is just impossible

2178
02:59:17,360 --> 02:59:21,630
Tanaka: The mountain nearby... which vicinity is it in?

2179
02:59:22,230 --> 02:59:26,370
Driver: ...

2180
02:59:32,010 --> 02:59:33,340
Tanaka: Ah there

2181
02:59:37,040 --> 02:59:38,980
Coordinator: Eh?

2182
02:59:40,680 --> 02:59:41,550
Tanaka: WOah!

2183
02:59:41,550 --> 02:59:42,980
Coordinator: What?

2184
02:59:42,980 --> 02:59:44,980
Coordinator: You're late! You should have hurried here!

2185
02:59:44,980 --> 02:59:47,590
Coordinator: Cuz I'm really scared, I hate this

2186
02:59:49,190 --> 02:59:52,560
Coordinator: Hurry up I'm really scared, hurry

2187
02:59:52,960 --> 02:59:54,560
Tanaka: Eh? What's going on here?

2188
02:59:54,560 --> 02:59:57,130
Coordinator: I don't know, they just told me to stay here

2189
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:00,330
Tanaka: You're Heipo-san aren't you?

2190
03:00:00,330 --> 03:00:01,700
Heipo: Right it's Heipo

2191
03:00:02,470 --> 03:00:04,570
Tanaka: Is it OK if you get in?

2192
03:00:04,570 --> 03:00:06,810
Heipo: Woah the driver!

2193
03:00:07,780 --> 03:00:08,340
Tanaka: Har?

2194
03:00:08,340 --> 03:00:10,140
Heipo: Give this letter(map) to the driver

2195
03:00:10,140 --> 03:00:12,150
Heipo: I don't know, I was given this for company

2196
03:00:12,450 --> 03:00:13,650
Tanaka: Right, so it's OK if you get on right?

2197
03:00:13,650 --> 03:00:14,820
Heipo: Right and give that to the driver

2198
03:00:14,820 --> 03:00:16,920
Heipo: With that we should be OK

2199
03:00:16,920 --> 03:00:18,190
Heipo: Ahh.. Scary

2200
03:00:19,320 --> 03:00:22,760
Heipo: Excuse me Mr. Driver, but on it is written where our destination is right?

2201
03:00:22,760 --> 03:00:24,590
Heipo: Could you get us there?

2202
03:00:24,660 --> 03:00:26,430
Heipo: Eh? Please say something

2203
03:00:26,430 --> 03:00:29,300
Heipo: Eh? This guy's scary...

2204
03:00:30,160 --> 03:00:33,200
This video tape recording is recorded by Tanaka & Heipo themselves, and unmanned cameras.

2205
03:00:33,200 --> 03:00:35,700
The staff was not involved with anything that happened on scene

2206
03:00:35,700 --> 03:00:38,110
Heipo: This is pretty amazing, it's pitch-black outside

2207
03:00:38,110 --> 03:00:40,610
Tanaka: Yea it's pitch-black

2208
03:00:40,810 --> 03:00:41,880
Tanaka: Just calm down OK? Heipo-san

2209
03:00:41,880 --> 03:00:44,310
Heipo: OK, I understand

2210
03:00:44,310 --> 03:00:46,310
Tanaka: We've entered one heck of a place

2211
03:00:46,310 --> 03:00:48,120
Heipo: Eh~ Noo

2212
03:00:49,680 --> 03:00:52,020
Heipo: No good Tanaka-kun, I'm scared

2213
03:00:52,020 --> 03:00:53,920
Heipo: I've had enough

2214
03:00:57,360 --> 03:00:59,560
Heipo: Ah ow ow ow ow ow

2215
03:00:59,560 --> 03:01:01,560
Heipo: Is the red light on? (Video recording)

2216
03:01:01,560 --> 03:01:02,500
Tanaka: Ah yes yes

2217
03:01:02,500 --> 03:01:04,930
Heipo: Look at this, this is somewhat incredible

2218
03:01:05,700 --> 03:01:08,370
Heipo: There's something, something over there

2219
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:09,970
Heipo: Looks like we're here

2220
03:01:09,970 --> 03:01:11,970
Tanaka: Eh? We've arrived?

2221
03:01:11,970 --> 03:01:13,540
Heipo: Uwaahh.. I don't wanna go out there

2222
03:01:13,540 --> 03:01:15,040
Heipo: EHH~!

2223
03:01:15,040 --> 03:01:16,240
Heipo: ah...

2224
03:01:16,240 --> 03:01:17,040
Heipo: ...my bad

2225
03:01:17,040 --> 03:01:18,610
Tanaka: Eh? What is it?

2226
03:01:19,040 --> 03:01:21,280
Heipo: I don't know, I thought I saw something move

2227
03:01:21,280 --> 03:01:22,820
Tanaka: Does this mean we have to get off?

2228
03:01:22,820 --> 03:01:24,850
Heipo: I don't know...uWOOAAHH  DRIVER

2229
03:01:25,690 --> 03:01:26,790
Tanaka: What's the matter?

2230
03:01:26,790 --> 03:01:29,760
Heipo: I just saw a shadow over there! A red one

2231
03:01:30,320 --> 03:01:31,360
Tanaka: Eh? What kind of shadow is it?

2232
03:01:31,360 --> 03:01:32,490
Heipo: See? A red one!

2233
03:01:32,090 --> 03:01:34,490
Tanaka: Isn't that your reflection Heipo-san!?

2234
03:01:35,900 --> 03:01:36,760
Heipo: UwaAAhh!

2235
03:01:36,760 --> 03:01:37,660
Tanaka: What's the matter?

2236
03:01:37,660 --> 03:01:40,170
Heipo: I.. don't know

2237
03:01:40,400 --> 03:01:43,100
Tanaka: Could you stop saying "I don't know"?

2238
03:01:43,940 --> 03:01:46,440
Heipo: WaAAh~ No more!

2239
03:01:46,440 --> 03:01:48,010
Tanaka: This is just terrible

2240
03:01:48,410 --> 03:01:52,450
Heipo: A torchlight this weak is just no good! Aaah

2241
03:01:54,250 --> 03:01:56,150
Tanaka: Eh? What's wrong?

2242
03:01:58,720 --> 03:02:01,820
Heipo: Ah.... I don't know

2243
03:02:02,590 --> 03:02:04,390
Tanaka: This is that right? A tent

2244
03:02:04,390 --> 03:02:05,960
Tanaka: Are we supposed to get inside it?

2245
03:02:05,960 --> 03:02:07,490
Heipo: I guess so

2246
03:02:07,790 --> 03:02:09,130
Tanaka: We have no other choice but to enter

2247
03:02:09,130 --> 03:02:11,930
Heipo: The car's gone...

2248
03:02:12,230 --> 03:02:14,270
Tanaka you're talented,

2249
03:02:13,670 --> 03:02:14,770
Heipo: Eh?

2250
03:02:14,270 --> 03:02:16,240
with the camera

2251
03:02:19,010 --> 03:02:20,270
Heipo: Alright! This is fine

2252
03:02:20,270 --> 03:02:20,640
Tanaka: Right

2253
03:02:20,640 --> 03:02:22,140
Heipo: Ahh.. I'm scared

2254
03:02:27,780 --> 03:02:30,250
Heipo: Tanaka-kun, let's close this, it's scary

2255
03:02:33,890 --> 03:02:36,490
Heipo: Scary~ scary

2256
03:02:37,120 --> 03:02:39,960
Heipo: Man.. Pull yourself together

2257
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:42,930
Heipo: Oh I don't know

2258
03:02:52,440 --> 03:02:54,210
Heipo: Tanaka-kun please stop it

2259
03:02:57,440 --> 03:03:00,580
Addressed to Tanaka and Heipo

2260
03:03:00,580 --> 03:03:02,450
You'll spend this short period of time

2261
03:03:02,450 --> 03:03:04,280
in this tent

2262
03:03:04,280 --> 03:03:06,020
When the alarm rings

2263
03:03:06,020 --> 03:03:08,660
Open the envelope and you'll find a map

2264
03:03:08,660 --> 03:03:11,360
On it you'll find the location of the spirit spot and

2265
03:03:11,360 --> 03:03:13,630
how to get there

2266
03:03:16,060 --> 03:03:19,300
PS: Heipo should also appear in the photograph that's taken

2267
03:03:20,800 --> 03:03:21,770
Be safe

2268
03:03:24,170 --> 03:03:33,080
Stay in the tent temporarily

2269
03:03:24,940 --> 03:03:33,080
When the alarm rings, head for the spirit spot

2270
03:03:25,510 --> 03:03:33,080
Heipo should be in the photograph that's taken

2271
03:03:33,180 --> 03:03:33,750
Heipo: So what does this mean?

2272
03:03:33,750 --> 03:03:35,850
Heipo: Is there really a map or something?

2273
03:03:36,120 --> 03:03:37,950
Heipo: "When the alarm rings, the map in the envelope..."

2274
03:03:37,950 --> 03:03:39,490
Heipo: It's that!

2275
03:03:40,290 --> 03:03:42,360
Heipo: I'm scared...

2276
03:03:44,990 --> 03:03:47,590
Heipo: I'm already worn out.. coming out here

2277
03:03:47,860 --> 03:03:49,230
Heipo: No more...

2278
03:03:55,200 --> 03:03:57,140
Heipo: No more~~

2279
03:04:00,210 --> 03:04:01,810
Tanaka: Cold~

2280
03:04:01,810 --> 03:04:03,580
Heipo: It's because it rang so suddenly

2281
03:04:04,280 --> 03:04:07,050
Heipo: So what now? Do we look at it (the map)?

2282
03:04:07,380 --> 03:04:08,780
These two are really something huh

2283
03:04:09,880 --> 03:04:12,090
Heipo: What does this mean?

2284
03:04:10,680 --> 03:04:12,320
The worst duo

2285
03:04:12,620 --> 03:04:14,720
Heipo: Mizunomi...

2286
03:04:14,720 --> 03:04:21,160
Take the photo in front of Mizunomi

2287
03:04:30,840 --> 03:04:32,670
Tanaka: Look at the map carefully

2288
03:04:34,070 --> 03:04:35,280
Heipo: Now we're outside aren't we?

2289
03:04:35,280 --> 03:04:36,440
Heipo: It's like plaza isn't it?

2290
03:04:36,440 --> 03:04:38,210
Heipo: We need to go straight and then make a right

2291
03:04:38,210 --> 03:04:39,180
Tanaka: So we go straight huh

2292
03:04:39,180 --> 03:04:41,820
Heipo: So firstly we go straight right?

2293
03:04:41,820 --> 03:04:47,050
Heipo: I can't see anything with the camera's light on!

2294
03:04:47,790 --> 03:04:50,020
Tanaka: Are we still to go straight?

2295
03:04:52,160 --> 03:04:52,860
Tanaka: Wait wait

2296
03:04:55,160 --> 03:04:56,360
Tanaka: Wait calm down calm down!

2297
03:04:56,360 --> 03:04:59,530
Tanaka: It's alright! Heipo-san calm down

2298
03:05:02,900 --> 03:05:04,300
Heipo: I don't know...

2299
03:05:04,600 --> 03:05:05,270
Heipo: EH~!

2300
03:05:05,270 --> 03:05:07,540
Tanaka: Can you please shine the light to the front?

2301
03:05:08,180 --> 03:05:09,410
Heipo: Tanaka-kun, do you know where we are?

2302
03:05:09,410 --> 03:05:10,710
Tanaka: No I don't but...

2303
03:05:10,710 --> 03:05:12,710
Tanaka: Man... isn't it just pitched black?

2304
03:05:13,410 --> 03:05:14,110
Heipo: NoO!!

2305
03:05:14,110 --> 03:05:14,850
Tanaka: Wait wait wait

2306
03:05:14,860 --> 03:05:16,250
Tanaka: Let's stop let's stop

2307
03:05:16,250 --> 03:05:18,850
Tanaka: Let's stop, stop a sec, really

2308
03:05:24,390 --> 03:05:26,960
Heipo: A tree...

2309
03:05:26,960 --> 03:05:29,430
Heipo: I hate this, I can't see at all

2310
03:05:31,930 --> 03:05:34,730
Heipo: I hate this... let's just end it here

2311
03:05:38,810 --> 03:05:40,610
Heipo: There's something here

2312
03:05:45,980 --> 03:05:47,910
Heipo: Ah! Moths moths!

2313
03:05:51,250 --> 03:05:56,260
Heipo: Wait a minute! No no no no! Moths moths moths!

2314
03:06:03,760 --> 03:06:06,070
Heipo: Is it because of the lights?

2315
03:06:09,770 --> 03:06:12,470
Heipo: Enough is enough, Moth-chan

2316
03:06:15,210 --> 03:06:16,880
Heipo: Stop it!

2317
03:06:16,880 --> 03:06:19,750
Heipo: I can't turn off the lights you know

2318
03:06:22,620 --> 03:06:23,880
Tanaka: Let's get closer

2319
03:06:23,880 --> 03:06:25,190
Tanaka: Feel my hand.. Feel my body

2320
03:06:25,190 --> 03:06:25,820
Heipo: Wait....

2321
03:06:25,820 --> 03:06:27,590
Tanaka: Feel my body.. No I mean..

2322
03:06:27,590 --> 03:06:30,020
Tanaka: When we snap the photo,

2323
03:06:30,020 --> 03:06:32,660
Tanaka: in order to stay close, we'll feel each other's bodies like now

2324
03:06:32,960 --> 03:06:34,360
Heipo: Ah I'm at ease.. at ease at ease

2325
03:06:35,400 --> 03:06:37,000
Heipo: Is it a right from here?

2326
03:06:37,830 --> 03:06:40,300
Tanaka: When the ground goes left, we'll make a right

2327
03:06:42,440 --> 03:06:43,340
Heipo: Ah the ground!

2328
03:06:43,340 --> 03:06:44,470
Tanaka: Eh? How can you tell?

2329
03:06:44,470 --> 03:06:45,470
Heipo: Well I don't know, but look

2330
03:06:45,470 --> 03:06:46,370
Heipo: Isn't it wide?

2331
03:06:46,370 --> 03:06:48,210
Heipo: Isn't it somehow wide?

2332
03:06:48,210 --> 03:06:49,240
Heipo: Ahh~ I can't see!

2333
03:06:49,240 --> 03:06:50,880
Heipo: I don't know!

2334
03:06:51,480 --> 03:06:52,280
Tanaka: Let's take a look at the surrounding area

2335
03:06:52,280 --> 03:06:54,650
Tanaka: Find a place to rest and the route we should take

2336
03:06:55,480 --> 03:06:57,780
Heipo: ooh.. no...

2337
03:06:58,620 --> 03:06:59,920
Heipo: no more...

2338
03:06:59,920 --> 03:07:01,090
Heipo: Ah!

2339
03:07:01,090 --> 03:07:01,690
Heipo: Is that it?

2340
03:07:01,690 --> 03:07:02,690
Tanaka: Could it be?

2341
03:07:02,690 --> 03:07:04,220
Heipo: Huh?..

2342
03:07:04,220 --> 03:07:04,820
Heipo: No....

2343
03:07:04,820 --> 03:07:06,590
Tanaka: Uwaaa... This is somewhat scary

2344
03:07:06,590 --> 03:07:08,330
Heipo: I'm scared

2345
03:07:08,330 --> 03:07:10,260
Heipo: So what do we do here? Should my back be facing you?

2346
03:07:10,260 --> 03:07:12,100
Tanaka: It's supposed to be a photo with you facing the front right?

2347
03:07:12,530 --> 03:07:14,430
Heipo: Let's be in the photo together

2348
03:07:14,430 --> 03:07:15,840
Tanaka: Then who's gonna take the photo?

2349
03:07:15,840 --> 03:07:17,970
Heipo: Oh right..

2350
03:07:17,970 --> 03:07:19,370
Heipo: Is this OK?

2351
03:07:19,370 --> 03:07:22,110
Tanaka: Please just stand there properly

2352
03:07:27,480 --> 03:07:28,110
Heipo: Where're you going! Where're you going!

2353
03:07:28,110 --> 03:07:29,750
Heipo: No no no no no no

2354
03:07:29,750 --> 03:07:31,320
Tanaka: I'm too close to take a shot

2355
03:07:31,320 --> 03:07:33,690
Heipo: Ah I see

2356
03:07:34,220 --> 03:07:36,390
Tanaka: Say cheese!

2357
03:07:43,330 --> 03:07:45,330
Tanaka: Ahh.. This is scary!

2358
03:07:45,330 --> 03:07:46,570
Heipo: Scary!

2359
03:07:46,830 --> 03:07:48,240
Tanaka: Let's get back, seriously

2360
03:07:48,240 --> 03:07:49,640
Tanaka: Shouldn't we hurry back?

2361
03:07:49,640 --> 03:07:50,870
Heipo: Hurry?

2362
03:07:52,810 --> 03:07:54,840
Heipo: What is this!

2363
03:07:54,840 --> 03:07:59,010
(The duo, frightened by orange peels)

2364
03:07:59,280 --> 03:08:00,950
Tanaka: Stop this already

2365
03:08:07,620 --> 03:08:09,260
Tanaka: Wait it's dangerous it's dangerous

2366
03:08:10,060 --> 03:08:11,830
Heipo: What's the matter~

2367
03:08:14,060 --> 03:08:15,730
Heipo: What's the matter~

2368
03:08:17,530 --> 03:08:19,230
Heipo: Are you alright?

2369
03:08:21,230 --> 03:08:23,240
Tanaka: It was tiring wasn't it

2370
03:08:23,240 --> 03:08:23,840
Heipo: Let's rest

2371
03:08:23,840 --> 03:08:25,310
Tanaka: Yea let's

2372
03:08:25,310 --> 03:08:27,310
Heipo: I can't take this

2373
03:08:28,540 --> 03:08:31,210
Tanaka: I really have the urge to go pee

2374
03:08:31,210 --> 03:08:32,950
Heipo: Are you going to?

2375
03:08:32,950 --> 03:08:34,080
Heipo: What will you do? Will you be OK? Can you hold it in?

2376
03:08:34,080 --> 03:08:35,220
Tanaka: I think I'll go

2377
03:08:35,220 --> 03:08:37,050
Heipo: Eh? By yourself?

2378
03:08:37,050 --> 03:08:38,450
Tanaka: I'll be back as soon as I can

2379
03:08:37,050 --> 03:08:42,320
Toilet

2380
03:08:38,450 --> 03:08:39,450
Heipo: Can I close this?

2381
03:08:39,450 --> 03:08:40,120
Tanaka: Sure

2382
03:08:40,120 --> 03:08:42,320
Tanaka: If anything happens I'll be back immediately

2383
03:08:46,760 --> 03:08:48,660
Tanaka: Is it over there?

2384
03:08:48,660 --> 03:08:50,430
Tanaka: Ah I'm scared

2385
03:08:50,430 --> 03:08:51,900
Heipo: Huh what?

2386
03:08:51,900 --> 03:08:53,170
Tanaka: Ah it's me

2387
03:08:53,170 --> 03:08:54,230
Heipo: Oh..

2388
03:08:56,740 --> 03:08:58,440
Tanaka: Ah I'm scared...

2389
03:08:58,440 --> 03:09:00,240
Tanaka: Uwaaa.. I'm really scared now

2390
03:09:05,250 --> 03:09:06,510
Tanaka: This is really scary

2391
03:09:06,510 --> 03:09:08,850
Tanaka: This is where I'll have to pee huh

2392
03:09:18,190 --> 03:09:22,460
(The camera's light dies suddenly)

2393
03:09:22,460 --> 03:09:24,530
Heipo: What's the matter~

2394
03:09:25,400 --> 03:09:28,100
(Heipo - startled by Tanaka's voice)

2395
03:09:28,100 --> 03:09:31,140
Tanaka: Wait a minute! The batteries!

2396
03:09:34,310 --> 03:09:36,340
Tanaka: Ah I dropped it! (Camera)

2397
03:09:37,480 --> 03:09:39,110
Tanaka: I dropped it...

2398
03:09:41,180 --> 03:09:42,620
Heipo: What what?

2399
03:09:42,620 --> 03:09:44,380
Heipo: Hurry! I'm scared!

2400
03:09:58,600 --> 03:09:59,800
Heipo: No no no no!

2401
03:09:59,800 --> 03:10:02,500
Tanaka: The zip! The zip!

2402
03:10:03,470 --> 03:10:07,110
Heipo: Stop it .. no more..!

2403
03:10:07,870 --> 03:10:09,610
Heipo: Where did you go?

2404
03:10:09,610 --> 03:10:10,740
Tanaka: I went to pee

2405
03:10:09,610 --> 03:10:11,610
THE TOILET!!

2406
03:10:11,010 --> 03:10:12,450
Tanaka: When I was about to open the door (toilet)

2407
03:10:12,450 --> 03:10:14,210
Tanaka: The batteries died out ya know

2408
03:10:14,210 --> 03:10:16,210
Tanaka: The camera's batteries

2409
03:10:17,120 --> 03:10:18,350
Heipo: Seriously?

2410
03:10:18,350 --> 03:10:19,820
Heipo: Uwaaa scary

2411
03:10:19,820 --> 03:10:20,790
Tanaka: It was sudden you know

2412
03:10:20,790 --> 03:10:23,890
Heipo: You were really shouting, I thought something had happened

2413
03:10:24,320 --> 03:10:26,090
What's the matter~

2414
03:10:26,090 --> 03:10:31,160
Spirit photography completed

2415
03:10:41,410 --> 03:10:42,740
When did you get back?

2416
03:10:43,680 --> 03:10:45,580
Just now.

2417
03:10:45,580 --> 03:10:47,750
Your eyes have really sunken in you know

2418
03:10:47,750 --> 03:10:49,350
It was the worst

2419
03:10:49,350 --> 03:10:50,880
Who was the person in the red hood?

2420
03:10:50,880 --> 03:10:52,490
Well I don't wanna see that person ever again

2421
03:10:54,390 --> 03:10:56,290
What happened?

2422
03:10:58,460 --> 03:11:00,730
He was really annoying

2423
03:11:02,230 --> 03:11:05,100
You look really irritated

2424
03:11:28,390 --> 03:11:31,290
Guys, today's data collecting ends here

2425
03:11:33,190 --> 03:11:35,430
The newspaper will be completed shortly

2426
03:11:35,430 --> 03:11:37,060
So rest easy while it's being done

2427
03:11:39,270 --> 03:11:40,230
Shall we go?

2428
03:11:41,600 --> 03:11:43,400
Go back.

2429
03:11:46,910 --> 03:11:48,440
So it's finally over?

2430
03:11:49,240 --> 03:11:55,280
(The journalists' hard day's work)

2431
03:11:49,240 --> 03:11:55,280
(Welcoming the results that come instantly)

2432
03:12:00,720 --> 03:12:01,320
Wooh I'm tired out!

2433
03:12:06,490 --> 03:12:08,230
Please line yourselves up here

2434
03:12:08,230 --> 03:12:10,400
Then descend the stairs

2435
03:12:10,400 --> 03:12:12,600
The newspaper should already be out right?

2436
03:12:14,930 --> 03:12:17,770
Well then, let's go down

2437
03:12:19,010 --> 03:12:21,010
Congratulations~

2438
03:12:22,040 --> 03:12:24,740
Everyone, Happy New Year!

2439
03:12:22,540 --> 03:12:26,440
Founder

2440
03:12:22,540 --> 03:12:26,440
Suga Kenji - Youth

2441
03:12:26,810 --> 03:12:29,650
Here's Ga- Su- Sports New Year's Issue!

2442
03:12:29,950 --> 03:12:31,950
Yamazaki-san

2443
03:12:33,090 --> 03:12:34,950
Uncle Matsumoto

2444
03:12:36,390 --> 03:12:37,820
Uncle Hamada

2445
03:12:37,820 --> 03:12:40,690
You were definitely sleeping

2446
03:12:39,860 --> 03:12:41,360
Uncle Endou. thank you..

2447
03:12:42,830 --> 03:12:44,430
He looked like he just woke up!

2448
03:12:44,830 --> 03:12:46,770
...Uncle

2449
03:12:48,800 --> 03:12:52,410
Everyone, I look forward to working with you again this year

2450
03:13:04,450 --> 03:13:05,690
Incredible!

2451
03:13:07,390 --> 03:13:09,020
Incredible, they really made a newspaper

2452
03:13:09,020 --> 03:13:11,020
Well then shall we?

2453
03:13:18,200 --> 03:13:26,510
No. of ass-whoopings

2454
03:13:26,840 --> 03:13:32,080
The asses of five reporters

2455
03:13:32,110 --> 03:13:42,920
The more you beat them, the sadder they get

2456
03:13:42,960 --> 03:13:51,930
The more you spank them, the sadder they get

2457
03:13:53,670 --> 03:13:56,700
Because it makes me laugh

2458
03:13:56,740 --> 03:13:59,770
Because it makes me excited

2459
03:14:00,610 --> 03:14:02,910
Because it makes me scared

2460
03:14:02,940 --> 03:14:11,620
It’s inevitable that you’ll be beaten

2461
03:14:12,190 --> 03:14:19,460
Blue bruises on the ass of a 40-ish year old man.

2462
03:14:22,630 --> 03:14:29,170
Surprise visitors attacked without a break

2463
03:14:30,040 --> 03:14:34,210
And I can’t resist a smile

2464
03:14:35,310 --> 03:14:42,050
By those big onions

2465
03:14:42,520 --> 03:14:48,320
My heart breaks for the first time

2466
03:14:48,720 --> 03:14:54,090
I got off the train at Kudanshita station
and walked up the hill

2467
03:14:54,960 --> 03:15:00,770
As I pass the stream of people

2468
03:15:01,040 --> 03:15:06,340
My buttocks swell up red in the twilight

2469
03:15:06,340 --> 03:15:12,550
With Fujiwara laughing behind me

2470
03:15:13,080 --> 03:15:18,550
Anna’s mother, the woman from Kayo, they both
leapt out

2471
03:15:19,250 --> 03:15:25,230
Oowada twisted his ankle

2472
03:15:25,630 --> 03:15:31,070
Junji’s ass, Bibari’s neck, turning around…

2473
03:15:31,770 --> 03:15:36,740
Nakamura’s anxiety at the growing appearance fees

2474
03:15:37,840 --> 03:15:43,640
When the joke is revealed, he laughs and gets beaten

2475
03:15:44,180 --> 03:15:49,820
It happens over and over again

2476
03:15:50,280 --> 03:15:55,560
Only the buttocks swell without a word

2477
03:15:56,260 --> 03:16:01,800
“I don’t care, I’m gonna scream” says Heipo

2478
03:16:02,200 --> 03:16:10,340
Song TL: /u/BratscheTLW

2479
03:16:10,740 --> 03:16:12,640
I think in your case, you should be the most tired one

2480
03:16:12,640 --> 03:16:13,710
Heipo-san right?

2481
03:16:13,710 --> 03:16:16,780
When he gets frightened, I'd ask "What happened?"

2482
03:16:16,780 --> 03:16:19,150
He'd go "I don't know!"

2483
03:16:20,080 --> 03:16:22,380
That was the extent of his intelligence

2484
03:16:25,220 --> 03:16:26,950
It's always "I don't know"

2485
03:16:27,720 --> 03:16:30,260
There are quite a bit of articles in the paper yea?

2486
03:16:30,260 --> 03:16:32,020
Yea there's even a segment on Umezu-san's funeral

2487
03:16:32,020 --> 03:16:35,290
???

2488
03:16:36,000 --> 03:16:37,330
Looks like Johnny Depp

2489
03:16:37,830 --> 03:16:38,900
His haircut eh

2490
03:16:39,530 --> 03:16:40,900
They don't look alike at all

2491
03:16:43,200 --> 03:16:44,640
There's the funeral too

2492
03:16:48,640 --> 03:16:51,280
'A lovey-dovey interview right in front of ex-husband' huh?

2493
03:16:51,280 --> 03:16:51,880
The 'New' Onii

2494
03:16:57,080 --> 03:16:57,880
You haven't tried it yet have you?

2495
03:16:57,880 --> 03:16:58,920
Me!?

2496
03:16:59,420 --> 03:17:00,450
Hamada-san too!

2497
03:17:00,450 --> 03:17:02,190
He's unwillingly to that's why

2498
03:17:03,460 --> 03:17:05,190
You already know what it does, so you should be OK

2499
03:17:05,190 --> 03:17:06,930
Yea it's because I've seen it already right?

2500
03:17:06,930 --> 03:17:08,900
Yea it shouldn't be a problem

2501
03:17:12,330 --> 03:17:13,500
What what? What're you doing?

2502
03:17:16,770 --> 03:17:18,070
What were you doing!

2503
03:17:18,770 --> 03:17:20,310
What's the point of holding it there?

2504
03:17:20,440 --> 03:17:21,710
Just feeling a little of it is enough

2505
03:17:21,710 --> 03:17:23,310
So letting go was OK?

2506
03:17:24,540 --> 03:17:25,950
You were holding it forever!

2507
03:17:25,950 --> 03:17:27,010
Everyone else let go!
