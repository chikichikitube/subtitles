3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,520
Good morning, folks

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,770
Good morning
- Right now it's 8:30 in Japan

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,880
And today, you're gathered here
for the Snow Freesia, as you know

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,500
What do you think?

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,240
How's this winter?

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,140
Let me know what you think, Imada

9
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,930
It snowed...
- Wet snow, mostly, huh?

10
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,570
- That's right
- Snowy days like this are the best

11
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,910
It was a quote from uh...
the late Ii Naosuke

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,410
Anyway

13
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:42,260
Our Snow Freesia it's not just a freezer,
it's a workout machine

14
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,250
For your abs, you knew that?

15
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:51,300
Just keep that in mind
and you'll forget about your usual freezer

16
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,850
I thought it sounded strange too,
when I first heard it

17
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,610
And now I've had one for over 5 years

18
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,440
You know?

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,000
Interesting
- It happens, you know?

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Is that so?
- So...

21
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,900
Knoooot!

22
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,010
Here

23
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,610
See? Foxes are interested in this too

24
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,500
They always follow me around

25
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,540
No matter where I am

26
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,250
See?

27
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,430
Ok, let's start from Imada

28
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,800
Let's go

29
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,170
What do you think?

30
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,280
What do you think, Imada?
- Well...

31
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,740
So, how do you wanna open it?

32
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,740
Tell me

33
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,420
Well...

34
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,310
Well, slowly I guess
- Slowly, and...?

35
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,540
So I won't flip it over
- Flip it over and?

36
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,840
That's it
- That's it? Good

37
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,780
Alright

38
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,150
Now, go and make a copy of this

39
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,400
What the...

40
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,900
There's a copy machine inside

41
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,310
Has this anything to do
with the Snow Freesia?

42
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,060
Cm'here, you

43
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,440
Ouch!

44
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,680
What are you doing?!

45
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,820
What the hell?
- What's your problem?

46
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,080
Expect this frequently

47
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,100
If you're here to make stupid jokes,
go home then

48
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,680
I'm sorry

49
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,500
You know damn well
my son died because of this

50
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,760
That's why, now...

51
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,200
Sorry for that, ok?

52
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,420
You reminded me of him

53
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,460
I see...

54
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,110
You look a bit like my son

55
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,600
Is that so?
- I'll write "I look like his son" on your face

56
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,700
You know that?

57
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,820
"I look like"...

58
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,780
"Like his son"
- Are you actually writing it?

59
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,160
See?

60
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,220
Alright then, who's going first?

61
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,580
Can we get inside it?

62
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,160
Of course you can
- Oh, I see

63
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,480
Alright, I'm going first

64
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,000
Very well, we'll start from Imada

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,240
You're Imada, right?
- That's me

66
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,900
Alright then, here's the Snow Freesia
- Yeah

67
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,760
And we have 5 balls here

68
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,500
I see... do I have to pick one?
- That's right

69
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,240
Let's see... number 3
- 3? No way, you can't pick that one

70
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,080
This is your first time, right?
- That's right

71
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,880
Let's start with this one, then
- Ok

72
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,580
Here, this is number 1
- Alright

73
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,620
Alright, give it a try
- Do I have to stick my fingers in it?

74
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,310
Trooot!

75
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,240
Alright, let's start
- Yes, please

76
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,400
Get on top

77
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,080
Open the "entration mistion"
at the bottom

78
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,440
- "Entration"?
Yep, open it

79
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,640
Isn't this where you put the veggies?

80
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,860
The hell are you talking about?
- I'm sorry

81
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,620
Why would you put veggies in there?

82
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,770
Well, it looks like...

83
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,040
My son used to say the same,
and now he's dead

84
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,520
You knew that?
- I'm sorry

85
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,860
Alright, so...

86
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,360
Open it up

87
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,340
Nice, now get in

88
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,340
Take a good look, ok?
We're getting through this

89
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,420
Sure

90
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,160
How is it going?
- Well...

91
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,440
Put the "wired tarp" on, please

92
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,140
"Wired tarp"?

93
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,100
The tarp
- Ah! This one

94
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,420
How should I put it?
- Anywhere is fine

95
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,120
Like this
- Ok

96
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,900
Are you ready?

97
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,160
If you open this upper window here
- Yes?

98
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,160
The engine will start to move
- Got it

99
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,340
And that's when you'll start, ok?
- Got it!

100
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,440
Don't joke around
- Yes

101
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,900
Let's go!

102
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,160
Open it up good
- Sure

103
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,280
Alright

104
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,180
Let's go

105
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,640
Ok, ok

106
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,500
See?

107
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,080
It was fun, wasn't it?

108
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,060
Was it?

109
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,490
Y-Yeah...
- It's a blast, right?

110
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:03,820
I mean... I thought I was going to
slide down a snowy mountain or such...

111
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,960
What was that?
- That's it...

112
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,980
I mean, it did move...
- And?

113
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,860
But it was just that, in the end

114
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,640
"Just that" what?
- I mean, it barely moved

115
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,200
That's what it is
- I see...

116
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,840
It's always been like this,
it's the fixed edition

117
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,080
You know?

118
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,240
What?

119
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,600
I mean, I wanted to experience
the Snow Freesia, I even paid for it

120
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,900
What the...

121
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,920
Show me how it's done
- Do I have to?

122
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,920
That's what you told me, right?

123
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,970
The hell are you talking about?

124
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,860
I've paid for this, you know...
Mr. Noda? Was that it?

125
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,310
Who's that? Are you kidding me?

126
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,120
Huh?

127
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,730
The hell are you sayin'?

128
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,370
You sorta look like him

129
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,600
Calm down, man

130
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,260
But I've paid for it
- Let it go

131
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,480
Screw this

132
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,030
Let's just go

133
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,700
