1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
determined to inform in the crowd

has a debt of about one used domestic car.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,680
Welcome to a 2-hour episode of Wednesday Downtown

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,890
Thanks!

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,660
It's a special episode

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,430
Let's welcome our first presenter

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,640
Who is it?

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,560
It's Milk Boy!

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,120
Hello everyone, we are the Milk Boys

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,440
You're just doing the opening of your manzai!

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,790
Thank you very much

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:36,350
Now picking up the film wrapped around the outside of the crab stick

12
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,050
What the hell?
-Thank you very much

13
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,250
No amount of this stuff is too much

14
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,480
The film?
-Yes, film

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,640
Although very sudden

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:52,140
What is posted on SNS will be written as network news at least once

17
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,240
Even if things are trivial, they will become network news

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,480
You made a weird "nyu" sound

19
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,520
You have to understand a little bit I am nervous

20
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,070
Don't make things too tense

21
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,970
There's still something down there

22
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,730
Thank you very much

23
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,230
Now picking up soggy algae

24
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,710
Thank you very much, there isn't much of this type of stuff

25
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,120
Thank you very much

26
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,870
I can't not pretend something is happening coming here

27
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,820
So, we bring you a project about network news

28
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,760
It is this:

29
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,720
Can't go home until being talked about on network news

30
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,370
Sounds tough

31
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,040
I see

32
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,880
What is it?

33
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,590
This involves deliberately doing something to make the news

34
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:42,930
And they can't go home until they achieve it

35
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,250
Intentionally difficult

36
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,100
Yuuki can go home right away then

37
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,100
※He got in trouble for a cheating scandal

38
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,420
Can go home immediately

39
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,240
Words will also become network news

40
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,480
Every time you say something, it turns into news

41
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,980
So, posting on social media

42
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,720
They can't ho home until they get on network news

43
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,520
And

44
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,520
Entertainer, athlete and historical rankings

45
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,480
A ranking of the popularity of Japanese people in the past and present

46
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,990
And Dancho vs. Kasuga patience challenge

47
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,950
You can't go back without being listed in the network news

48
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,590
Everyone is very happy!

49
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,970
People who can easily be covered

50
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,310
Indeed easy to be in the news

51
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:14,840
The above members are a collection of people with different likelihoods of being on the news

52
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,470
Good selection

53
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,190
I'm on a hot streak

54
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,790
I can be on the news

55
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,920
Indeed

56
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,820
I put my feet like this and lie down

57
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,430
I just say hello and i'm on the news, it's over, I can go back immediately

58
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,560
Bye-bye

59
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,400
Big star!

60
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,970
For today

61
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,810
There's 3 strong 2 weak

62
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,600
Indeed

63
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,240
No problem, right?

64
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,170
It's okay!

65
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,540
How can such people get on the news?

66
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,150
And so, the challenge begins

67
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,010
First

68
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,980
Is it okay to just tweet as usual?

69
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,320
Straight away

70
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,930
Kuro-chan is impressive

71
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,650
Can you tell us what content you are posting?

72
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,290
Can I send "Michopa~" now?

73
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:57,220
Eh, "Michopa~" will make the internet news?

74
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,690
Sometimes

75
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,320
Really?

76
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,630
"Michopa will hate it, don't do it" or something like that

77
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,400
Michopa~

78
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,390
Should work

79
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,140
Known for his cumbersome operation, Kuro-chan

80
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:13,990
Immediately, he sends a disgusting filtered photo

81
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,350
That's weird. Will that work?

82
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,790
Can we go to TBS first?

83
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,980
What's going on?

84
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,410
Want to see who is in today

85
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,720
After I combine with other artists, it'll be easier

86
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,050
When standing on Kamaitachi before

87
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,820
You could see my underwear

88
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,090
That became network news

89
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,130
"SUNDAY JAPON"

90
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,500
Some others

91
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,800
Wada is here now!

92
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,900
Great! If you take a selfie with Wada it will be 100% popular!

93
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,750
This person is really...
-Not respectful

94
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,400
That quick?

95
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,800
Definitely will make the news

96
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,110
There is no appointment for anything!

97
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,510
It's fine, Sanma and Takeshi Kitano,i've taken pictures with all of them with this thing

98
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,930
She's messing around

99
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,180
Ah!

100
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,680
Good morning

101
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,110
Awesome

102
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,680
What's happening so early?

103
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,450
Social distance, distance!

104
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,190
Keep your distance!

105
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,260
You're working really hard, so early

106
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,680
Yes, can't get too close

107
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,790
So cute!

108
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,100
However

109
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,160
What's going on?

110
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,230
Went to a meeting

111
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,740
You're too scary

112
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,730
Couldn't get a photo

113
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,570
Obviously wanted to take a group photo

114
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,900
Eh?

115
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,670
Wait wait

116
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,940
What's going on?

117
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,810
I was followed by him now

118
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,580
Really?

119
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,380
Eh, now he's my follower, so cute!

120
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,890
Never uses honorifics

121
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,820
Having a meeting inside

122
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,850
Have a look

123
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,240
So stalkerish

124
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,190
What's up?

125
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,770
You'll be told off for this

126
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,100
This kid is crazy

127
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,910
This will make the news

128
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,740
Really knows what she's doing

129
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:59,050
Now that Wada is following me, he'll definitely see this tweet

130
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,050
You are so loud, seriously

131
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:05,590
Before it becomes network news, I might get beaten up

132
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:06,720
But

133
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:10,520
But wait, it's 9:00

134
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,230
I have to go live

135
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:17,930
There's a show with Ahn Mika and Chris Matsumura as MCs

136
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,600
Wait, let's go over there

137
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:26,740
So, Fuwa leaves the scene temporarily to go to a live broadcast

138
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:32,580
First i'll look at the news

139
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,250
Then

140
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:38,150
If there is something I can copy, i'll copy it

141
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:42,760
I'll send a tweet with something similar to become news

142
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,490
Ah, Hiromi

143
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,910
Hiromi claims to be a "Tokyo Disneyland virgin"

144
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,830
Ah, Matsumoto Hitoshi

145
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,830
Playing a smartphone game debut

146
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,340
And that makes news?

147
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,570
Ah!

148
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,840
Takuya Kimura has failed to quit smoking

149
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:07,250
Should I quit smoking?

150
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,280
So

151
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,750
Okay, tweeted

152
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:19,560
At the age of 20, I started to smoke 2 packs of cigarettes a day

decided to quit smoking

This is the last one of my life

153
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,300
Can this make the news?

154
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,700
And

155
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,440
I have debt too

156
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:35,840
I want to inform the public that i'm in debt for a used car

157
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,520
Seems likely

158
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,880
Informed Twitter about quitting his smoking

159
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,120
So, let's see what happens

160
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,480
It'd be better to write the amount of debt

161
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,590
Yeah

162
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:58,100
Sari Kato said she left her daughter with
someone else and went on a one-night
trip to a hot spring by herself, and was
criticized for it

163
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,100
There will be criticism today, too, it seems

164
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,770
The makeup is too exaggerated

165
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,540
By the way, recently

166
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,640
What are the things about you that have become network news?

167
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,280
I cooked muffins that looked like roasted mushrooms, or something like that

168
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,140
What's wrong with this person?

169
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,110
"Roasted mushrooms" and so on became the internet news

170
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,330
The place where Sari Kato goes is

171
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:20,340
A 120 square meter photography studio

172
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:25,500
The rent is up to 1,030,000 yen

173
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,260
The studio was rented for a video shoot, right?

174
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,930
That...

175
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,730
A multi-purpose meeting in the studio

176
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,800
A multi-purpose photo studio

177
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,040
Why is this person so rich?

178
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,180
How does this person make so much money?

179
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,050
Really want to know

180
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,620
In this strange location, how will she try to get the public's attention?

181
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:52,950
My daughter's toy is a Givenchy bear doll

182
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,720
In 30 minutes, it was on the news

183
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,190
Her Dior bottle also made the news

184
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:02,640
Pitching news related to luxury goods seems to be easy to make online news

185
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,860
At the time of the webcast

186
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,500
There are definitely people who ask, "Whose clothes are these? Please take a full body shot" and other questions

187
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,580
So, the very first pitches were

188
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:15,500
Detailing the day's outfit and price to the public

189
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,050
The kind that can immediately make the news

190
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,480
Star Matching

191
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,720
This way

192
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,650
The total amount is out there

193
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,840
Will it work so soon?

194
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,050
About the same as a normal monthly income

195
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:29,070
The total is 13,770,080,000 yen

196
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,130
Monthly income?

197
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:32,130
Most people's general income

198
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,980
Who's? Who's?

199
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,090
Ready to post to instagram

200
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:41,770
Today's outfit is 13.8 million

201
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:41,770
Today, I was told by my manager that i'm
like a walking department store, so I calculated
the total amount and made it public for
the first time

202
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:40,390
Today's outfit is 13.8 million

203
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,400
Should be close

204
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,110
One of the two weaker people...

205
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,340
We've gotta see this

206
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,240
Joyman Takagi

207
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:49,580
I get coverage sometime

208
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:54,480
"I saw Joyman?" on Twitter there are many such tweets

209
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:58,420
When i'm just around

210
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:02,820
Ordinary people also tweet "Joyman is here"

211
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,740
So, aiming for the common man

212
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:13,400
I'm gonna go to the front of the company and try and attract some attention

213
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:15,750
No, no, no

214
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:20,830
In front of Yoshimoto Kogyo, he starts his battle to try and get someone to tweet about him

215
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,530
Why?

216
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,700
He's looking

217
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,320
What's going on?

218
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,320
If I go to an idol's house it should be easy

219
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,270
Isn't Rina Hashimoto a good choice?

220
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,920
Rina Hashimoto?

221
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,060
The black diamond

222
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,100
Her words will be in the news

223
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,690
What the hell?

224
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,230
She's also my type

225
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,790
What the hell is this guy?

226
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,030
So this will definitely be covered

227
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,430
I'm calling

228
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,480
So

229
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,190
What is he doing?

230
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,040
Hello

231
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,070
Ah, hello, Rina?

232
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,010
Sorry to call you so suddenly

233
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:55,880
What is it?

234
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:01,450
Can I come to your house? I'm on a shoot

235
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,150
Eh, well, no

236
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,150
Not really?

237
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,490
Eh why why why?
-No way

238
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:09,590
Asking so suddenly, of course not

239
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,860
Although sudden

240
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,360
But it's for Wednesday Downtown

241
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:16,240
Despicable!

242
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,530
So bad

243
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,720
Under the pretext of program planning

244
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,750
Just for a moment

245
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,730
Stalkingly negotiated for 5 minutes

246
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,740
No hesitation at all!

247
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,310
Wait, I really just woke up

248
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:28,940
That' fine that's fine

249
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,550
I'll come over

250
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,010
Let's say in 30 minutes

251
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,150
In 30 minutes? Got it

252
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,150
Really just got up

253
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,060
Not a single word of respect for him

254
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,540
So, during the journey

255
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,800
Wednesday Magic

256
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,160
Should I do my top 5 girls?

257
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,030
Or 7, like God 7?

258
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:53,840
Kuro-chan's Girl Ranking

259
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,840
Kuro-chan's Girl Ranking

260
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,640
Also posted on instagram and Ameba Blog

261
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:03,060
Kuro-chan's hands don't stop moving

262
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:03,900
Impressive

263
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:08,510
"How much would you do an AV for?" I've been asked that

264
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,050
The fee mentioned at the time was over 100 million yen

265
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:16,460
But if I was actually interested, the real thing

266
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,960
Would actually be a lot lower

267
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,120
She can't decide what to send next here

268
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,620
A different type of monster

269
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:29,320
Rina, can I come in?

270
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:29,930
Really!?

271
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,860
So gentle

272
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:35,210
Can I take a selfie with you in your pajamas?

273
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:38,050
"Rina's pajamas are so cute", something like that

274
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,350
It'll definitely make the news

275
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,080
So, sorry, can you put on your pajamas?

276
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,750
Me?

277
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,820
Yeah

278
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,720
How does he know where she lives?

279
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,920
Really?

280
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,280
Shame on you!

281
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,490
I'm sorry, i'll do anything you want after

282
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,130
What kind of relationship is this?

283
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:52,270
So, after forcing her to change into pajamas

284
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,880
The photography session starts

285
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,000
That's good, that's good, that's good

286
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,510
I can't believe she really let him shoot

287
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,890
Pajamas... I'm
sorry to bother
you! The pajamas
of Rina are also
lovable~♪

288
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,780
I've gotta go now

289
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,940
I will come back

290
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,950
Only stayed for 10 minutes

291
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,800
Kuro-chan was soon driven out

292
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,180
Even so

293
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,000
2.5 hours have passed since the start

294
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,270
The contributions of the 5 members posts are shown below

295
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,730
Impossible

296
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,830
What is this for?

297
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,870
Good morning

298
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,710
Nothing happened

299
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:55,560
Although Disneyland is reopening,
for those who haven't been there
yet, let Kuro-chan as
Donald Duck heal your hearts

300
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,220
No one has been successful yet

301
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,460
Fuwa and and Sari are the ones to watch

302
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,830
Morita and Joyman?

303
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,530
No, those two people do not have a chance

304
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,730
They'll be doing it for a week, right?

305
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,690
At this time

306
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,870
Ah!

307
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,650
Eh?

308
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,740
Aren't I up already!?

309
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,610
Got up while not even paying attention!

310
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:20,490
Scary scary

311
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,680
What's happened?

312
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:21,590
Impressive

313
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,980
The "God 7" article

314
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,960
Really want to beat him up

315
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,040
Kuro-chan Introduces His "God 7" List of Favorite Girls

316
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,090
So fast!

317
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,110
Who is in first and second place?

318
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,700
It's in the news!

319
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,030
Thank you very much!

320
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:43,840
As before, Kuro-chan's followers are trolling him like crazy

321
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:49,580
"The comments such as "I don't think he's in anyone's mind," and "It's like Death Note..." keep coming

322
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,180
That's not true

323
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,050
They should be very happy

324
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,280
Although Fuwa said she would never lose

325
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:01,520
No, no, no, the popularity level is completely different

326
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,060
I'm not like that noisy woman

327
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:07,980
So, 2 hours and 42 minutes after the start

328
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,770
Kuro-chan finishes first

329
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:15,280
Sorry, this is Kuro-chan

330
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,070
I'm already in the news

331
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,000
Eh? It's a lie, right?

332
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,140
Sorry, a genuine news publication

333
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,280
Really? It's in the news?

334
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,380
I'm up!

335
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,680
What is this tone of voice?

336
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,210
How did you make the news?

337
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,280
What made the news?

338
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:33,420
My top-7 ranking of girls

339
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,460
I just needed to rank 7

340
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,090
Really?
-So fast

341
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,530
Eh, wait

342
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,960
I can't believe i'm not in the list

343
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,400
What's wrong with you?

344
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,410
Why do you want to be in that ranking?

345
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,140
Everyone, go for it!

346
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,160
It's too weird to try to want to be in that ranking

347
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,800
Okay, I'm hanging up

348
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,170
So noisy!

349
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,890
This condescending attitude

350
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:57,380
Really seems like they're trying to be funny, so noisy

351
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,780
There's no use for them, it should just be all about me

352
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,120
Such a shame. I want to be number one

353
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,650
We're too slow

354
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:07,350
Its my manager and driver's fault

355
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,090
It's definitely not my fault

356
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,230
Scary face

357
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,020
Here

358
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,000
So scary

359
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,260
Sari has an appointment at 11:30

360
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,240
Who cares about you?

361
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,990
What do you have to do?

362
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,100
Date

363
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,000
So I have to stop for the moment

364
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,980
What!?

365
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,930
Regardless of the ongoing shoot

366
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:26,870
Due to a lunch date with a man, Sari Kato's shoot is temporarily halted

367
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:33,390
On the other hand, Morita, is at TBS TV

368
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,830
It's gonna be tough for Morita

369
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,220
Ah, Milk Boys!

370
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,920
I could meet Milk Boy

371
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,950
Really?

372
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,550
We have known each other since we were in Osaka

373
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,920
Excuse me

374
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,360
Good morning

375
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,760
It's been a long time. I'm Morita

376
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,260
Yeah, we know. What's up?

377
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,170
What is this?

378
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
Long time no see

379
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,870
We played together several times at a public performance

380
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,880
Indeed

381
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,310
We've seen each other a few times

382
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:10,490
I never thought I would see you here one day

383
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,820
Yes, in Tokyo, indeed

384
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,090
Its very emotional

385
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:36,910
I just met Milk Boys, who I performed
together with to just a few people in
Osaka, at a TV station in Tokyo. I
never thought that the day would
come when we could meet in a
lounge several times bigger than the
shabby stage. I want to cry a little.
Let's drink together when we can

386
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,380
Super long

387
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:44,720
Mixing Asakusa Kid with Nagabuchi

388
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,190
A heart-warming story

389
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,620
Surprise happenings can make the news

390
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,460
I want to go home with this, really

391
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,400
Then, after 4 and a half hours from the start

392
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:02,110
Joyman Takagi's attempted public sighting led to no results

393
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:02,850
Too bad

394
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:11,380
I'll try uploading my own and getting someone to cover it

395
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:19,050
Where is Joyman?

396
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,740
A change of strategy

397
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:22,890
On the other hand, after the 90-minute live show

398
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,940
Fuwa is finally back

399
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,290
Why didn't you share anything?

400
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,240
I planned to post while there

401
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,100
But they just kept talking all the time

402
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,870
I couldn't look at my phone for even 1 second

403
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,140
Okay! OK

404
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,180
I like Toshiya!

405
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,080
I've tagged him

406
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,640
And

407
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,940
I was shooting when Anh Mika came in

408
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,060
Ah, Ahn Mika

409
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,840
Nice yukata!

410
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,750
What's going on here?

411
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,480
What's going on here?

412
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,350
There is no wall here

413
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,260
There is!

414
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,060
No wall

415
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,600
She did a mime

416
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,030
This'll surely be big

417
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,520
Magic Chris Matsumura!

418
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,580
Chris Matsumura is still Chris Matsumura after his transformation

419
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,420
Videos with collaborators

420
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,100
Been ages since I've seen Chris Matsumoto

421
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,480
Are shared continuously

422
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:32,420
It's here.
RT Where is Joyman?

423
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,590
After 7 hours

424
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,090
It's now 3pm

425
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,620
Sari Kato returns from a date

426
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,460
Where are you going?

427
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,850
After checking the phone

428
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:42,130
Ah, news!

429
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,540
This would happen

430
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,850
Real amount

431
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,720
But this will not be without repercussions

432
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,430
So, 7 hours after the start, Sari Kato goes home

433
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:05,620
I've made the news

434
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,290
It's a lie, right?

435
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:09,330
Really?

436
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,760
Really?
-It's a lie, right?

437
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,970
The first and second place is a Kuro-chan and Sari Kato...

438
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:18,070
Japan has entered a not-so-good era

439
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,040
You are too rude to say that!

440
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:25,110
Two people are finished

441
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,650
Where should we go?

442
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:29,950
Today is the election for the governor of Tokyo, right?

443
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:32,380
Yes, today is July 5th

444
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,880
Yes, this is the voting day for the Tokyo governor's election

445
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:41,590
I want to take this opportunity to vote

446
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,160
Really, it's not for location shooting

447
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,580
So

448
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,470
Finished

449
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,570
Disguised in order not to cause trouble for the voting office

450
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,650
Went to vote

451
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,200
I'm off to vote

452
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,300
What's going on here?

453
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,310
Did it!

454
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,520
I always perform my national duty

455
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:09,220
Really, if I had posted about this, they would have got 500 million votes from young people

456
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,790
Eh, did you take a picture?

457
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,730
Didn't take any photos 'cause it was so dark

458
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,930
So now I'm going to take pictures in front of the metropolitan hall

459
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,730
Great! A particularly good shot!

460
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:25,370
Great! Took a great photo!

461
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,500
Great, right?

462
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,380
What a great photo!

463
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,530
This is a really good photo

464
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,010
Indeed news worthy

465
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,570
Too photogenic, right?

466
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:36,980
It's really something

467
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,490
A Japanese girl, right?

468
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:49,060
Full compliance with national
obligations, everyone go and
vote!

469
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,340
Tweeted

470
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,620
This is good!

471
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,310
Just 10 minutes later

472
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,870
Ah, already on 10,000

473
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:56,570
There's 10,000 likes.
-10,000 likes?

474
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,870
It's a big deal, isn't it?

475
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,270
At this speed, I think it will definitely be on the network news

476
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,780
Eh, first in the retweet list now

477
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,600
Awesome

478
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,980
Great, the first in Japan!

479
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,950
Awesome

480
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,280
The second is Tomosaku Maezawa

481
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,720
The first is Fuwa

482
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,290
And all very good comments

483
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:19,490
"It's a good thing that influential people are calling for more votes," and so on

484
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:20,690
All positive comments

485
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:25,400
I can do anything for Wednesday Downtown

486
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,930
On the other hand, at the same time

487
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,840
How about gossip?

488
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,170
Morita, this won't work

489
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,440
For example

490
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,280
Roppongi

491
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,410
Has bars where you can XXXX

492
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:39,650
There

493
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:43,650
XXXX has gone there

494
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,240
That's bad

495
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,090
How about that type? Hints

496
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,820
Actress's instagram

497
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:52,960
I take the same photo at the same place

498
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,660
"These two are dating, right?" and so on

499
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,660
The rules for this are very strict

500
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,230
Sorry...

501
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,770
Impossible

502
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,140
All the things I want to do are forbidden

503
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,510
Against TBS' rules

504
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:14,990
Morita's ideas continuously hit a wall

505
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:22,790
Cleaned up the streets because I had a little time! End of my first job as a PR ambassador!

506
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,470
Litter picking volunteer

507
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,750
The exact opposite of Twitter

508
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,750
No, no, no

509
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,590
Cigarette butts

510
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,830
Wanna smoke

511
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:35,030
If I get 5,000 likes, i'll never
say a certain word again. If
there are 10,000 likes
i'll ban another word

512
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:35,030
Report to everyone! Already confirmed to
play in next year's Molkky Worlds! I'll win
the championship next year!

513
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:34,210
The two weaker ones keep making mistakes

514
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,960
The last person in the top 3, Fuwa

515
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,940
How about it?

516
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,140
We're on!

517
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:46,970
At this point she contacted a certain person

518
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:52,280
Really happy

519
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,650
Really great

520
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:54,490
That is

521
00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:02,260
Look~~
finally met, my ancestor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
Shinoraa♥♥♥♥♥♥

522
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,570
A person Fuwa worships

523
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,060
Shinohara Tomoe

524
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,760
I've loved her since I was three years old

525
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,830
I imitated her look

526
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:09,440
We are one heart, one body, twins

527
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:15,410
Will a collaboration between young and old personalities make the news?

528
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,380
However

529
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,410
I'm off to my next job

530
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:22,480
You are busy!

531
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:28,980
The big celebrity, Fuwa, is off to do a variety show

532
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:33,430
If I see Wada in the lounge here, i'll be sure to take a picture

533
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,590
I'm off

534
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,220
But ten minutes later

535
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:43,170
Eh? Fuwa

536
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:44,590
Don't break the door

537
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,840
What's going on?

538
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,270
Up!

539
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,860
Sure enough

540
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,580
I saw it while walking down the road

541
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:01,540
So, Fuwa can go home after 10 hours and 50 minutes

542
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,390
This news is quite good

543
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:09,370
By the way, this post is now up to 40,000 retweets

544
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:13,840
With 284,000 positive comments on Twitter

545
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,280
And the other 4 submissions of the day

546
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:22,140
Other than the one of Chris Matsumura the other three made the news the day after

547
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,830
Also made the news

548
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:29,070
It proves she's a hit

549
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:34,370
Here, she speaks with the other contestants

550
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,640
So

551
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:43,350
Seriously!?

552
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:44,900
Did everyone make the news?

553
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,270
Scary!

554
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,870
Fuwa is non-existent

555
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,370
Right now Takagi you're better looking than Fuwa

556
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:57,950
That's right, Takagi, who was beginning to think he'd never be able to go home

557
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:02,440
Made a big move to dye his hair pink

558
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:10,160
The one from Exit's dyed hair was in the news

559
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,190
Ahhh

560
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,060
Went to the beauty salon.
Seriously asked them to dye it like EXIT

561
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,210
So how was the response?

562
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,570
Turned pink!

563
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:28,810
If I take a photo with him together maybe that could work

564
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:31,280
But he just took a photo of himself

565
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:35,410
Takagi's photo could make it

566
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,170
At 9.00pm

567
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,450
Will it be on the news?

568
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:48,470
Undoubtedly, news updates are slow at night

569
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,960
What's going on?

570
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,200
Ah, EXIT retweeted it

571
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:02,140
I didn't expect to they'd retweet it

572
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:06,950
Such a good guy

573
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,440
Is that all you do?

574
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:17,920
I really want to go home today

575
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,670
I'm on the news. Sorry. I'm really sorry

576
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:33,410
Seriously!?

577
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,610
I got on the news first

578
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,580
Really?

579
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:43,500
Joyman Takagi took 14 hours and 16 minutes to make the news

580
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,920
I was retweeted

581
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:50,020
Wow, really?

582
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,920
I have no news whatsoever

583
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,160
Is there anything else you can do?

584
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,360
Not at all

585
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,670
Maybe change your name

586
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,800
That's too much, isn't it?

587
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,670
Change my name

588
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:07,840
Change my name just because of Wednesday Downtown

589
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,210
It could be the second failure since Ontony

590
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,810
The time has past 00:00

591
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:19,000
At this point, the pitch ends

592
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,980
So

593
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:25,690
This is the place you are staying today

594
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:28,030
This place is scary as hell

595
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:28,830
What is this?

596
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:35,430
Staying overnight in a cheap hotel somewhere in Tokyo, bound by the rule that he can't go back

597
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,910
So cheap
-Don't say cheap

598
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:44,310
Wow first time seeing a room like this

599
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,910
I'm not going to die of oxygen deprivation, am I?

600
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:47,660
Don't say that

601
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,150
What do you think so far?

602
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,600
Quite interesting

603
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:59,260
Is Morita the only one to watch in the second half?

604
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,690
A bit unbalanced

605
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:04,050
It feels like it will be very short if Morita is alone

606
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,300
I feel like I don't want to watch it at all

607
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,540
Does it end here?

608
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:21,950
Good morning
-Good morning

609
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:24,920
I kept hearing the sound of rain

610
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,950
The sound of rain, followed by the sound of rain

611
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:32,930
Adjusting the air conditioner is hard as hell

612
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,530
3-tatami room

613
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,760
Is it cold?

614
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,600
Cold and hot at the same time

615
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,630
It's really hard, so annoying

616
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,210
Not on the news yet?

617
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:48,840
No

618
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:53,950
By the second day his hands are already tied

619
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,920
What to do to be on the news?

620
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:06,460
I can't do that one? Talk about not getting paid for that one show

621
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:08,760
Which show?

622
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,360
A very popular variety show

623
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,930
I received no answer at all when I called the person in charge

624
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:14,470
Eh?

625
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,770
Always avoiding me

626
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:19,200
It has been delayed for two or three years without payment

627
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,540
It's okay for me to say it

628
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,510
After all, the notice fee is owed

629
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,220
After all, it is the president

630
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:30,970
But because the TBS Broadcasting regulations prohibit such things

631
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:36,700
Instead, he first checks the day's comedian news

632
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:40,790
High Heels Momoko and her kid out shopping

633
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,740
So cute

634
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:49,500
What the hell, why does this make the news?

635
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:51,740
Stop it

636
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:55,780
A reproduction of the side dishes of the restaurant

637
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,450
Very interesting

638
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:04,270
Confusion about what to do

639
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,450
Morita, becomes irritated

640
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,530
Can I smoke?

641
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:15,290
Eh, you haven't quit smoking?

642
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,430
No, I can't, really

643
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:21,200
I can't keep going without smoking

644
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,270
If this continues

645
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:29,170
Although I decided to
try to quit smoking yesterday,
I couldn't bear it. I'm sorry
for all the people who
supported me.

646
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:27,830
Quitting smoking lasted only one day

647
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:41,620
It smells so good!

648
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:49,690
He then uploads a video of the burn marks caused by past cooking

649
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,970
In two days he has posted 7 times

650
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:01,060
Despite posting on Twitter multiple times, he's yet to hit the news

651
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:08,450
Name change?

652
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:11,480
It doesn't matter anymore, i'll change it to something like St. Louis, whatever

653
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:11,720
Hey, hey, hey.
-Stop it

654
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:17,020
Nothing has been achieved by the 34th hour

655
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:22,810
But then, Morita comes up with a plan

656
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,990
He is waiting for someone

657
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,360
The other person is...

658
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:31,200
Here we go. Here we go

659
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,380
It's Fuwa, Fuwa, right?

660
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:37,110
The big celebrity Fuwa

661
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:42,520
What are you doing, need my help?

662
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,650
Fuwa, you're a freelancer, right?

663
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,490
Yeah

664
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:51,660
Why don't you join our office, please?

665
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:56,390
Fuwa, seriously you have to join us

666
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:59,100
It will definitely make the news

667
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:04,540
Fuwa, please, if you join it'll definitely make the news

668
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:09,340
You're really worried about another day

669
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,710
I can't

670
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:16,350
How could I possibly join your agency?

671
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:23,600
Pitching the attempted scouting that was simply rejected

672
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:29,750
Fuwa also retweeted, "I said it was okay to have a meeting with the office since they open at 10, but I refused."

673
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,420
I said it was okay to have a meeting with the office since they open at 10, but I refused

674
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,700
Sure enough, she's funny!

675
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:40,250
That hotel again

676
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,880
Why? Really

677
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:52,810
Just now, thanks to Fuwa, it's been viewed by more than 10,000 people

678
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:55,290
But still not in the news

679
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,030
So annoying!

680
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:06,630
Sell my organs?

681
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:12,350
As the time hits 9.00, a third day becomes apparent

682
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:23,150
Wait, eh?

683
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,250
Wait a second, Look at this, on Friday

684
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:32,790
Goodbye Light of Youth and Milk Boy's reunion, comedy fans are moved to tears

685
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:38,230
Goodbye Light of Youth and Milk Boy's reunion, comedy fans are moved to tears

686
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,330
How about this one?

687
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:34,950
The time difference is huge

688
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:38,230
I'm on. I'm on

689
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,540
Great!

690
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,910
Unexpectedly, a submission made 32 hours ago becomes the news

691
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,250
It took a long time

692
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:58,920
Sure enough a gossip magazine saved me

693
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,920
Anyway, if I become popular

694
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,330
If Friday reveal a scandal about me i'll still forgive them

695
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:15,180
So, after 37 hours and 30 minutes, Morita can finally go home

696
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,060
Ultimately, it happened, we were on the news

697
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,740
We are also guilty of not being in the news

698
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:32,170
Great! By the way, the inclusion of Fuwa was great!

699
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:37,920
Her rejection of Morita's offer also later made the news

700
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,350
If it was Chris, he wouldn't be able to go home

701
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:48,000
He didn't participate this time

702
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,930
Let’s get on with the next presenter please

703
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:03,430
Jinnai Tomonori!

704
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,880
A divorcee

705
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,670
I'm divorced ... still making jokes about this

706
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:12,750
This time I bring a special project

707
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,730
First take a look at this

708
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:19,310
Ancient and modern Japanese people popularity ranking

709
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,280
This is it

710
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:27,770
Three years ago, one of the most famous people in Japan was revealed to be Ichiro

711
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:27,770
※Ichiro Suzuki Japan's most famous baseball player, now retired

712
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:31,350
This is another survey on the popularity of Japanese people

713
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:33,900
Last time, deceased individuals were not counted

714
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,960
This time, some famous people who are no longer with us are included

715
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:41,050
So modern and ancient figures

716
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,690
Historical figures are also allowed?

717
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:45,830
Of course, such as Sakamoto Ryoma and so on

718
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,530
This is a project of what the result would be if this comparison is made

719
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:51,500
The results will be interesting

720
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:55,610
After this, the ranking of Japanese people's popularity will be revealed

721
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,950
Ancient and modern Japanese people popularity ranking

722
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:08,320
The program team incorporated various categories of celebrities

723
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,450
1000 people were picked randomly

724
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,500
From the late teens to early 70s

725
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:18,570
A questionnaire survey was conducted in Japan

726
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,790
The same applies to this survey of Yoshimoto artists living nationwide

727
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:28,850
Together with the general population's survey, its a total of 2,000 questionnaires

728
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:34,820
So, the top 100 Japanese celebrity popularity rankings are created based on the questionnaire

729
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,540
So let's start with the 100th place

730
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,680
Essentially a really nice person

731
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:46,490
I think they are positive

732
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,370
I think it's a comedian

733
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:48,560
But inadvertently also seems a little melancholy

734
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,460
Seems like they challenge a lot

735
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:55,590
And they're often successful. I think it's awesome

736
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:58,360
I'm not sure about this person either

737
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,870
What's the name?

738
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:02,230
No... i'm not sure then

739
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,200
Really don't know the name

740
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,870
They play an instrument?

741
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,510
The one with the guitar

742
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,440
It's Miyazono

743
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,240
Miyazono

744
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,550
In 100th place, Miyazono

745
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:19,120
He enjoys wide popularity in the under-fifties age group

746
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,860
At the age of 60 or 70, there is no presence

747
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:25,660
Total popularity is 65.6%

748
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:29,660
In ninety-nine is Junji Takada

749
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,440
The opposite of the previous in the lower age groups

750
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,580
In particular, only 20.2% of those in their teens are aware

751
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,660
It can't be helped

752
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:39,770
Total popularity is 65.9%

753
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:42,100
So, ninety-eighth place is

754
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:46,790
Always smiling and able to respond to any kind of weirdness

755
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:50,750
It's as if they were born to do comedy

756
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:53,180
Married to a TV announcer, right?

757
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:55,250
They do that

758
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,890
Himura

759
00:38:57,330 --> 00:39:03,170
With a characteristic appearance, Himura of Bananaman is ranked ninety-eighth

760
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:06,330
With a popularity of 66.1%

761
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:11,120
Ninety-seventh place is Shohei Ohtani

762
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:15,040
Ninety-sixth is Sakagami Shinobu

763
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,520
After that, in ninety-fifth place is

764
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:23,650
Heard they're a very capable person

765
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:26,450
But seems to like women maybe a bit too much

766
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:30,560
Huh? Who is this? I've seen him before

767
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,460
Which textbook was he in?

768
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,760
Seems like literary kind of thing

769
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,900
Originally, the Prime Minister, of course, the former

770
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,830

Ito Hirobumi

772
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:45,570
Ninety-five Hirobumi Ito

773
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:49,270
Here, for the first time, a historical character joins the list

774
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,940
As opposed to the 40-somethings who used the old 1000 yen bills

775
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:56,130
The difference in perception with the under-thirties is obvious

776
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:59,800
The total is 66.5%

777
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:03,900
The other rankings from ninety to one hundred are as follows

778
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:10,790

Also, two members of Arashi

782
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:36,360
Among them, the eighty-first ranking is

783
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:43,960
He is the man that women of our time long for

784
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,460
Is he the one who imitated Junichi Ishida?

785
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:50,540
The person with the rolled up knitted sweater?

786
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,170
Junichi Koishida?

787
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,060

Showa's Big Star

789
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,200
How is that possible

790
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,440
Police...?

791
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,810

00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:57,240
I think i've seen a program about him, something to do with a vault

805
00:41:58,270 --> 00:41:59,140
Tokugawa Ieyasu?

806
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,470
No

807
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:03,510
Like...
-Emperor Tenchi?

808
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,080
It's the monkey, isn't it?

809
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,680
What is the name of the one nicknamed Monkey?

But the teenagers do not know her very well

912
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,430
Indeed, not even half

913
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,060

00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:56,000
Ask him

950
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,420

00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:18,540
Who is the most famous person in Japan?

972
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:22,910
So, that's everything up to 11

973
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,420

Well, yes, it's true...
-Although I love them so much

981
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,900
Even if you say so...

982
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:56,330
But the fact that more than 50 people don't know Downtown is incredible

983
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,250
Confused with Kiyohara

984
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,340

Comedy monster

00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,870
The one who doesn't know Downtown

1091
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:38,200
Must know Tamori and Tetsuko Kuroyanagi, right?

1092
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,400
Should do

1093
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,360
Bring that man to me

1094
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,680
Wanna beat him up?

1095
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,710
I want to ask that person a lot of questions

1096
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:50,400
Like do you know this or that  person?

1097
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:54,880
Surely he knows omelet rice or curry rice, stuff like that, right?

1098
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:56,690
Surely, right?

1099
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,020
Cheeseburger or something

1100
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:00,000
Cheeseburger could be a bit iffy

1101
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,220
"It's something with cheese in it," or something like that

1102
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:08,940
Let's welcome the next presenter

1103
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:17,400
It's Kendo Kobayashi

1104
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:25,490
Do you all know these two?

1105
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,970
Of course

1106
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:36,110
These program has realized these two are extremely odd

1107
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:40,950
Kasuga is incredibly good at staying put when told

1108
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:44,540
Yes.
-Speaks strange languages too

1109
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,630
Basically, we know

1110
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:51,730
These two have been found to have unusual endurance

1111
00:58:52,980 --> 00:59:02,020
Dancho did a verification of riding a bicycle for 24-hours

1112
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:08,830
And a competition in -15 degrees in the snow in thin clothing for 2 hours and 20 minutes

1113
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:13,530
As well as surviving in a sauna at 80 degrees with clothes on for 56 minutes

1114
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,640
"Surviving"...

1115
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:20,900
Kasuga was proven to be even more obedient than dogs when being told to wait

1116
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:25,050
He waited for staff for 6 hours and 39 minutes

1117
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:29,720
He was told to wait, so he waited

1118
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:30,790
Incredible

1119
00:59:30,790 --> 00:59:35,730
I've looked at him differently since then

1120
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:40,210
So, we put these two together and came up with this project

1121
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:45,720
Dancho vs Kasuga endurance duel

1122
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:51,120
Finally its time to pit them against each other

1123
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:54,120
One-on-one

1124
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:56,450
Degawa was also involved in this shoot

1125
00:59:56,450 --> 00:59:58,160
Yes
-Really?

1126
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:01,750
With fear and trepidation

1127
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:03,820
Both are very unyielding

1128
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:13,770
I was concerned enough after seeing the 24-hour bike ride

1129
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:17,800
Downtown were also shocked
-Yes, yes, yes

1130
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:22,090
If it's an ordinary program such as Shinuske's

1131
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:25,810
Everyone would have congratulated him and been very moved

1132
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:29,880
Very moving
-With female guest tears brought to tears or something

1133
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:33,620
Its obviously so hard to ride for 24 hours

1134
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:39,920
Sorry I messed up at the most important part

1135
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,930
Sounds like the sound of cicadas flying over

1136
01:00:43,930 --> 01:00:46,560
Like cicadas chirping hikihikihi

1137
01:01:04,350 --> 01:01:09,150
The commentary for this matchup is brought to you by Degawa Tetsuro

1138
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:18,190
To be honest, for me, I am more interested in this than M-1

1139
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:18,960
Thank you

1140
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:24,570
I think it's going to be a great match and I'm looking forward to it

1141
01:01:24,570 --> 01:01:26,740
We also look forward to your commentary

1142
01:01:27,370 --> 01:01:34,860
This time, the first one to win three games from these nine competitions will win

1143
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,950
The initial competition is

1144
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,290
So the first to choose is Dancho

1145
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:45,190
Lets start with the super hot bath
-So quick!

1146
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:47,610
Super hot bath
-So quick, so quick

1147
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:48,430
Not bad

1148
01:01:48,430 --> 01:01:52,960
It was the first thing I saw

1149
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,930
It's decided, then, super hot bath

1150
01:01:55,610 --> 01:02:00,040
Dancho uses his superb sense of variety shows and chooses the hot bath

1151
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:05,680
This is called the 'super' hot bath

1152
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:09,380
Because it's hotter than the average variety hot bath

1153
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:13,780
And the heating device will start after entering the water

1154
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:14,480
Eh?
-Eh?

1155
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:16,010
It won't cool down

1156
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:27,050
This time, because of the two electric heaters, the water temperature will rise one degree every minute

1157
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:31,200
First time i've heard some heating rules like this

1158
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,200
It's already hot, right?

1159
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:36,070
So one degree is already a huge difference

1160
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:38,050
So

1161
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:40,710
First, the water is tested

1162
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:45,520
By Degawa, the first person to get into the tub

1163
01:02:45,850 --> 01:02:50,190
Well, i'll rely on past experiences to judge

1164
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:54,860
I should be able to last 30 seconds to a minute

1165
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:58,830
Although I do not know the specific temperature first

1166
01:02:58,830 --> 01:03:02,270
Is the temperature known? The usual hot bath

1167
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:05,670
Real temperature? Real...

1168
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:10,410
The real temperature is about 46 degrees

1169
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:15,650
For me its 46, for our group leader its 44

1170
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:18,050
Everyone is different?

1171
01:03:18,350 --> 01:03:20,680
Our leader will be angry if he's told

1172
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:23,550
If you're feeling unwell it'll be lowered to 42

1173
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:24,850
Isn't that just a normal shower?

1174
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:27,890
The temperature is just right

1175
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:32,800
So, Degawa will now test it

1176
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:35,700
46 degrees is hot enough.
-It's hot enough

1177
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:39,700
Can already feel the heat

1178
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:40,540
It is still fine

1179
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:45,180
So scary!

1180
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:50,450
Hey, don't push me in!

1181
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:52,350
Remember social distance, we can't

1182
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:53,980
Eh, what?

1183
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,020
People should keep distance from each other!

1184
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:58,190
You can't push me in because of social distancing, right?

1185
01:03:58,190 --> 01:04:02,230
This is bad. No, no, no

1186
01:04:02,230 --> 01:04:04,230
If i'm not pushed I can't react!

1187
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:10,830
So fast.
-Hot, wait...

1188
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,440
Eh eh eh eh, Degawa?

1189
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:16,740
Isn't this stupid, Wednesday?

1190
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:18,880
What? What?

1191
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:20,440
What's going on?

1192
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,740
Not 30 seconds at all

1193
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:31,220
Sorry, it's hotter than I thought it would be and it scared me

1194
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:36,330
How many degrees? How many degrees?
-49 degrees

1195
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:38,130
Two seconds is all it took to get red

1196
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:45,000
Can you see this? Please document this

1197
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,340
Really red

1198
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:49,240
Really burnt, so quickly

1199
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:51,840
After learning about the power of hot water

1200
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,550
I'll go second

1201
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:59,860
Dancho is up first in the super hot bath duel

1202
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:04,450
So, Dancho will try it first, please let us know your thoughts first

1203
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:08,090
I won't retreat until a layer of my skin comes off

1204
01:05:08,090 --> 01:05:10,760
So cool

1205
01:05:11,090 --> 01:05:14,100
Nothing interesting to say at all

1206
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:17,020
So, Dancho will go first

1207
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,870
Scald it, scald it, scald it

1208
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:24,770
Go, go, go!

1209
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:30,250
Dancho has entered the water of 49 degrees

1210
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:33,750
Awesome

1211
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:41,670
The temperature is rising

1212
01:05:44,290 --> 01:05:46,000
Awesome!

1213
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,750
How long can he put up with it?

1214
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,830
Butt on the ground!

1215
01:05:49,830 --> 01:05:51,400
Good sitting posture

1216
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,740
Not moving a muscle

1217
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,220
Probably doesn't want to move

1218
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:58,740
Oooh wow, over 30 seconds now

1219
01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:03,080
Eh, has he stabilized?

1220
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:09,270
Not moving for more than 40 seconds

1221
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:16,690
Isn't it too fast, isn't it too fast?

1222
01:06:16,690 --> 01:06:19,660
Temperature is up up up up up

1223
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:20,860
It rises one degree each minute

1224
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:23,500
No no its hotting up already

1225
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:32,260
Now the warming device water temperature has exceeded 50 degrees

1226
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:34,980
No, no, no, it definitely went up already

1227
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:38,480
It's gotten weird. It's gotten weird

1228
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Then

1229
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:42,450
Getting red

1230
01:06:42,450 --> 01:06:44,550
So strong, two minutes

1231
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:47,520
No no, this is more than 1 degree, more than 1 degree, more than 1 degree

1232
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,360
It's gone up again!

1233
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:52,000
The water temperature should be over 51 degrees

1234
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:53,860
Up!

1235
01:06:58,070 --> 01:07:00,540
Ah i'm burning!

1236
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:03,660
Come out, come out!

1237
01:07:03,710 --> 01:07:07,480
Up again!

1238
01:07:06,010 --> 01:07:09,750
The soup is boiling

1239
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:12,430
Exactly how long will he last?

1240
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:15,500
This is really...

1241
01:07:17,390 --> 01:07:20,220
You can do it!

1242
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,290
What's the count? What's the count? What's the count?

1243
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:27,600
3 minutes 3 minutes 3 minutes 3 minutes

1244
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,700
3 minutes, up again!

1245
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:33,970
He wants to pass 3 minutes

1246
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:39,760
Is it up to 3?  -Not yet, 55

1247
01:07:40,350 --> 01:07:44,330
56 57 58 59 3 minutes

1248
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:48,580
Oooh wow so strong

1249
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:50,600
Dancho sets a record of 3 minutes and 1 second

1250
01:07:51,590 --> 01:07:54,290
So red!

1251
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:03,780
Completely red, there's no bit that isn't red

1252
01:08:04,130 --> 01:08:06,140
I've never seen anything like this

1253
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:08,540
So strange so strange, what's happened to the chest here

1254
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:11,970
The armpit is especially bad

1255
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:13,380
Incredible

1256
01:08:13,410 --> 01:08:15,910
Dancho seems to have more sensitive skin than the average person

1257
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:24,690
You have to pay attention to where you put your foot and the surface of the water

1258
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:27,620
This piece of water is so hot

1259
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:29,030
The hot water will flow upwards

1260
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:37,970
A medical examination of the Dancho's skin then takes place, after which the duel continues

1261
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:42,040
Next, Kasuga takes on the challenge

1262
01:08:41,490 --> 01:08:42,960
It's too hard to top

1263
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:45,910
I see

1264
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:48,980
Ah, I see!

1265
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:53,550
It does feel hot here already

1266
01:08:53,850 --> 01:08:57,190
What exactly do you want to feel, Kasuga?

1267
01:08:57,190 --> 01:08:58,620
Ok

1268
01:08:58,620 --> 01:08:59,860
I'm going!

1269
01:08:59,860 --> 01:09:05,360
So, hot bath, here I come!

1270
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:05,790
Not easy for Kasuga either

1271
01:09:14,570 --> 01:09:16,570
I see...

1272
01:09:18,110 --> 01:09:21,340
That's how it feels...

1273
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:25,310
It's not often that you see Kasuga like this

1274
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:32,660
It's not hot at all!

1275
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:37,090
Really...

1276
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:47,770
Foot foot foot foot!

1277
01:09:47,770 --> 01:09:49,140
It's been heating up since then, right here

1278
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:52,240
Indeed! Although invisible to the naked eye, the temperature did rise

1279
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:53,640
The temperature changes in a flash

1280
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:01,920
I see, I have never experienced something like this

1281
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:03,490
Please take care of me for the first time...

1282
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:09,490
Ah... it's really hot

1283
01:10:10,070 --> 01:10:15,030
Just like Dancho, Kasuga also survives the hot water to over 50 degrees

1284
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:21,140
Ah, it's true, what Dancho said is true

1285
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:22,810
He is an honest person

1286
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,040
Its true about the top

1287
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,410
From the feet to the top

1288
01:10:28,010 --> 01:10:30,440
I see-

1289
01:10:32,650 --> 01:10:35,280
Ahh...!
-It's 2 minutes and 30 seconds

1290
01:10:36,490 --> 01:10:40,020
Hold on a little more, a little more, a little more, a little more.

1291
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:42,560
Wow is he coming out? Is he coming out?

1292
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:46,700
Ah--! It hurts!

1293
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:48,900
Ouch!

1294
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:53,540
It's not often that you can hear the words "it hurts" in the bath

1295
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:56,130
The feeling has changed from "so hot" to "so painful"

1296
01:10:56,130 --> 01:11:00,270
10 seconds left. 10 seconds left!
-Can he beat Dancho's record?

1297
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:02,180
Wow, it's getting there

1298
01:11:03,150 --> 01:11:04,850
Wow, he's over!

1299
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:18,760
So hot-!

1300
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:21,030
So hot-!

1301
01:11:21,290 --> 01:11:23,900
So hot-!

1302
01:11:24,170 --> 01:11:27,170
I don't feel anything on my side anymore

1303
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:32,410
It really feels like being whipped

1304
01:11:32,410 --> 01:11:35,090
Look at the color of his side is completely red

1305
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,620
It's hot! These swimming trunks!

1306
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:42,320
Really impressive!

1307
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:48,670
The first round goes to Kasuga

1308
01:11:50,350 --> 01:11:54,420
The rule is that the next matchup is chosen by the loser

1309
01:11:55,660 --> 01:12:02,460
This thing Kasuga is very good at, of course, I am also very good at it

1310
01:12:02,650 --> 01:12:04,970
Underwater breath-holding duel

1311
01:12:04,970 --> 01:12:07,270
Ah, here it is!

1312
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:14,910
So the second round takes place in a pool

1313
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:20,450
The 2nd round is Dancho vs Kasuga in a breath-holding duel

1314
01:12:20,860 --> 01:12:21,990
Please offer us a few words, Dancho

1315
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:25,630
Well, 15 years ago

1316
01:12:25,630 --> 01:12:29,900
I had a similar match with Kasuga

1317
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:31,030
So i'm looking forward to this

1318
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:37,400
Indeed, these two previously faced off in a diving competition before

1319
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:42,010
Well, I won the "hot water" part anyway

1320
01:12:42,010 --> 01:12:46,050
So I hope Dancho will pick up the pace

1321
01:12:46,050 --> 01:12:48,080
In short

1322
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:50,420
He seems to be really angry

1323
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:54,060
Didn't think it was funny at all

1324
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:59,520
Degawa also tries this first

1325
01:13:05,330 --> 01:13:06,600
I’m OK—

1326
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:09,570
You'd definitely be ok like this!
-Absolutely

1327
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:12,240
30 seconds is average

1328
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:12,350
Finally the time has come for the duel

1329
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:18,010
Tap me every 30 seconds

1330
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,220
Pat me on the back

1331
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:21,320
Every minute?
-Yes

1332
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:24,520
Okay, the one minute countdown begins now

1333
01:13:25,370 --> 01:13:27,300
Doing it at the same time

1334
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:31,430
The battle has already begun with this first minute

1335
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:35,810
The two adjust their breathing to prepare

1336
01:13:36,910 --> 01:13:46,360
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

1337
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:56,170
An amazing image

1338
01:13:57,300 --> 01:14:01,890
Their breathing before going under is really impressive

1339
01:14:06,530 --> 01:14:10,830
This is one hell of a battle

1340
01:14:14,970 --> 01:14:16,920
Seems tough

1341
01:14:18,570 --> 01:14:20,030
It's 30 seconds

1342
01:14:22,350 --> 01:14:25,750
They are both motionless

1343
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:26,550
No way, right?

1344
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:28,110
It's now 1 minute and 30 seconds

1345
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:32,160
Not long after, they've now survived 1 minute and 30 seconds

1346
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:39,910
Seems like they'll pass 2 minutes

1347
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,110
So scary

1348
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:44,510
This is the underwater image

1349
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,210
That's awesome

1350
01:14:46,230 --> 01:14:48,610
1 minute and 50 seconds, almost 2 minutes

1351
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:54,720
Kasuga...

1352
01:14:54,790 --> 01:15:01,160
These two still haven't come up

1353
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:04,960
But Kasuga is starting to make some small movements

1354
01:15:05,990 --> 01:15:10,060
Although Kasuga's body is moving slightly his head hasn't

1355
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:10,440
Dancho is incredible

1356
01:15:10,150 --> 01:15:16,080
It's true, Kasuga is a little shaken. 2 minutes and 20 seconds.
-It's over, it's over, it's over

1357
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:18,260
Kasuga looks like he's struggling a bit

1358
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:19,330
Is Dancho also struggling?

1359
01:15:20,530 --> 01:15:22,400
It's over. Is Dancho okay? He's shaking a bit

1360
01:15:22,570 --> 01:15:23,970
Is he shaking?
-Ah, it's moving

1361
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:29,050
Kasuga is out

1362
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:30,920
Dancho's done it

1363
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:32,980
I'm OK!
-Let's check the time

1364
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:42,550
The time difference between the two is about 10 seconds

1365
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:45,230
I’m OK

1366
01:15:45,510 --> 01:15:52,890
In the underwater duel, Dancho stayed under for 2 minutes and 43 seconds and Kasuga for 2 minutes and 32 seconds

1367
01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:55,230
The winner is Dancho!

1368
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:06,230
The winner of the second round is Dancho

1369
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:12,870
So, Kasuga will choose the 3rd round

1370
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:20,530
Yes, I'll go with oden. Let's have some super hot oden

1371
01:16:20,870 --> 01:16:30,300
The rules are simple, eat these three super hot ingredients in order, the faster one wins

1372
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:36,910
What do you think, Degawa?
-This is a big deal!

1373
01:16:36,910 --> 01:16:40,720
This is like a steam train

1374
01:16:41,470 --> 01:16:45,420
Here we also let Degawa try it out

1375
01:16:44,950 --> 01:16:48,090
Degawa experienced it all

1376
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:50,460
Wow!

1377
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:54,700
It's still bubbling!

1378
01:16:55,030 --> 01:16:56,870
Wow really incredible

1379
01:16:57,330 --> 01:17:01,900
Wait a minute, I can't get it up.
-They're all in one big pile

1380
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:05,440
Look at this and you'll understand
-Even the fish cake is impossible

1381
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:06,270
Indeed

1382
01:17:05,770 --> 01:17:07,440
Okay, I'll eat it

1383
01:17:06,870 --> 01:17:08,090
Really eating it!?

1384
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:11,910
Wow, this is too hot, right?

1385
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:12,610
It's too hot!

1386
01:17:11,910 --> 01:17:14,080
Wow it's scary

1387
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:20,290
Whoa! Hot!

1388
01:17:20,290 --> 01:17:21,390
Whoa! Hot!

1389
01:17:24,430 --> 01:17:26,560
Okay, that's tough

1390
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:37,340
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry

1391
01:17:37,710 --> 01:17:43,050
Ah, it's really hot.
-You should cool it down

1392
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:46,520
Seriously, I've never eaten something so hot before

1393
01:17:46,950 --> 01:17:48,720
I've done something similar before

1394
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:52,860
But one time I was asked to-

1395
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:56,510
The third round is the super hot oden duel

1396
01:17:56,750 --> 01:18:00,500
The patience of our staff is really awful

1397
01:18:00,570 --> 01:18:02,770
The staff doesn't allow for anything

1398
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:05,120
Prepare - Start!

1399
01:18:07,970 --> 01:18:11,570
It's a great feeling a great scene.
-It's boiling

1400
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:14,140
Is it from the egg to the fish cake?
-Start with the egg

1401
01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:18,070
Wow we are off, Kasuga is eating it!

1402
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:22,400
How hot are the eggs?

1403
01:18:23,470 --> 01:18:29,020
What the hell is wrong with this guy!
-Seems to be a strategy to cool it down in the mouth

1404
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,590
Sure enough these two people are too good

1405
01:18:33,150 --> 01:18:34,950
That's awesome

1406
01:18:35,330 --> 01:18:39,200
It's definitely super hard on the mouth right now

1407
01:18:39,870 --> 01:18:41,310
Kasuga is awesome!

1408
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:44,610
Just putting it in your mouth is impressive enough, right?

1409
01:18:44,610 --> 01:18:48,940
How to say... i'm moved

1410
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:52,490
After Kasuga, Dancho is now also chewing!

1411
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:54,470
Wow that was fast!

1412
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:55,380
No way!

1413
01:18:55,380 --> 01:18:56,420
Eat the fish cake next!

1414
01:18:58,220 --> 01:18:59,860
Hey, hey, look at Dancho

1415
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:07,100
Kasuga is now ready to eat fish cake
-He practically swallowed the egg

1416
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:08,580
You can't eat this in one go

1417
01:19:15,170 --> 01:19:19,480
This guy is amazing!  Wow it's awesome!

1418
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,030
They both have the same expression

1419
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:22,460
Bad bad bad

1420
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:23,680
That's awesome...

1421
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:24,490
Dancho is flailing

1422
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:25,580
It's really awesome

1423
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:29,670
There's a gap of just one item

1424
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:35,260
Their mouths look very distorted

1425
01:19:38,230 --> 01:19:40,060
He's still stuck on the egg

1426
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:44,070
Just one egg... an egg is so painful

1427
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:49,070
Whoa, Dancho!
-Kasuga is now on the radish

1428
01:19:49,070 --> 01:19:50,170
It's too fast!

1429
01:19:52,510 --> 01:19:56,310
You can't, it's impossible to eat it!

1430
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:08,660
Dancho still hasn't put the fish cake in his mouth

1431
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:12,760
Oh, Dancho's put it in!

1432
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:17,200
Stuffing it in!

1433
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:24,140
I've never seen chopsticks used like this...
-He's shoving it in

1434
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:27,910
Dancho is using a great move, he's stabbing it

1435
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:31,960
On the other side, Kasuga is struggling with the final boss: Radish

1436
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:35,290
Dancho is still trying to catch up on the fish cake

1437
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:42,870
Okay now both of them are on the radish stage! Dancho has caught up!

1438
01:20:43,030 --> 01:20:44,900
Who will be the winner?

1439
01:20:45,710 --> 01:20:49,550
Dancho's method is good, eating around the edges

1440
01:20:49,630 --> 01:20:51,800
Ah, Kasuga put it in! Will he swallow it completely?

1441
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:54,140
Dancho also stuffs it in!

1442
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:59,970
Who will be the winner? Who will it be? Who will it be?

1443
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:02,380
The one who swallows first is the winner!

1444
01:21:03,010 --> 01:21:04,520
A hot battle

1445
01:21:04,970 --> 01:21:09,150
Dancho is struggling with the heat of the radish

1446
01:21:09,340 --> 01:21:12,050
Who will be the one to swallow it all first?

1447
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:18,630
Okay-! Thanks for the meal!

1448
01:21:18,630 --> 01:21:23,340
Please show the camera your mouth

1449
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:26,310
Kasuga wins!

1450
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:30,790
Your mouths must really be in a bad state right now

1451
01:21:30,790 --> 01:21:35,310
Yes, i'll have to be careful what I eat tomorrow

1452
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:37,820
So, the scores are currently 2-1

1453
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:41,870
The fourth competition chosen by the loser is

1454
01:21:43,420 --> 01:21:48,790
This elastic band endurance duel

1455
01:21:49,590 --> 01:21:52,260
I think maybe i'll go with this
-I got it.

1456
01:21:52,260 --> 01:22:01,000
Think calmly and carefully think about playing this with how your mouths are right now

1457
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,040
Huh? Oh...

1458
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:10,180
This endurance duel involves both people pulling one end with their mouth

1459
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:14,970
First, Degawa tests it out

1460
01:22:22,490 --> 01:22:23,790
Hey? Coughing?

1461
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:27,400
I'm sorry, I'm out of breath... sorry, sorry

1462
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:34,060
With no way back, Dancho's choice, the elastic band showdown, begins!

1463
01:22:40,450 --> 01:22:45,170
Kasuga is powerfully pulling away gradually

1464
01:22:41,110 --> 01:22:42,270
Oh, I see

1465
01:22:50,290 --> 01:22:53,590
Dancho is now handing over the reigns to Kasuga

1466
01:22:54,790 --> 01:22:56,390
They're both close

1467
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:59,730
This is a true battle

1468
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:01,900
Now Dancho is leading the aciton

1469
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:06,990
This kind of protracted war is too tiring, right?

1470
01:23:10,710 --> 01:23:14,610
Ordinary people, their jaw wouldn't be able to handle it

1471
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:14,870
And so it goes on, one after the other, in and out

1472
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:19,120
Whoa, 10 minutes?

1473
01:23:18,810 --> 01:23:23,550
They are really both after victory, you can feel it, right?

1474
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:33,130
So, after another 10 minutes, finally

1475
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:37,770
Wow, Dancho is pulling like crazy!

1476
01:23:41,270 --> 01:23:42,470
Ah, damn it!

1477
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:44,010
Too much force, right?

1478
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:47,080
Ah, damn it!

1479
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:54,250
What just happened! What's going on!?

1480
01:23:54,250 --> 01:23:56,940
Dancho won!

1481
01:23:58,550 --> 01:24:01,190
A great show, look at his sweat

1482
01:24:01,390 --> 01:24:05,530
It escaped, it escaped me

1483
01:24:07,820 --> 01:24:13,420
Now the two are tied

1484
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:17,740
What is the final stage chosen by Kasuga?

1485
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:26,830
I'll choose the acupuncture board one

1486
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,350
Hey, what's this?
-I don't understand it either

1487
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:34,740
Then the final battle is the upright acupuncture board not moving duel

1488
01:24:31,690 --> 01:24:33,210
This one is probably the hardest

1489
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:40,220
Foot acupressure boards are placed on 2-meter-high pillars

1490
01:24:41,390 --> 01:24:44,690
They must stand on them barefoot until they can stand no longer

1491
01:24:45,030 --> 01:24:46,950
The rules are as simple as that

1492
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:51,670
Ah, it hurts...

1493
01:24:53,010 --> 01:24:56,980
Ah, it hurts... this could be over very early

1494
01:24:57,110 --> 01:25:01,680
Even these two are super powerful, surely they can't stand it for that long

1495
01:25:01,980 --> 01:25:07,060
Probably everyone but Dancho and me thinks so
-It's true...

1496
01:25:07,790 --> 01:25:15,000
Finally, the final showdown will be held. Who will get the title of King of Endurance?

1497
01:25:15,730 --> 01:25:18,500
Climbing up you can really feel the height
-This is quite high

1498
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:22,600
It's much higher than it looks from below.
-It's not the same at all, right?

1499
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:29,610
Also very narrow, just a tiny bit of space, makes it seem worse

1500
01:25:29,610 --> 01:25:31,810
So, please take off your shoes!

1501
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:36,210
This could be over straight away

1502
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:40,190
Ow...

1503
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:44,430
I can't believe Kasuga has such a pained expression

1504
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:51,140
So let's start the final round!

1505
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:53,810
Here we go

1506
01:25:55,220 --> 01:25:56,440
Kasuga's expression is interesting

1507
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:01,140
His face has completely changed

1508
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:02,740
What the heck is this...

1509
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:05,710
How does it feel?

1510
01:26:05,710 --> 01:26:09,380
No pain no pain no pain

1511
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:12,790
It doesn't hurt, it doesn't hurt at all

1512
01:26:12,990 --> 01:26:19,330
How to say, the positioning is important due to the different parts of the feet

1513
01:26:19,330 --> 01:26:25,930
Moving it slightly feels better but its also risky because of how narrow the space is

1514
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:29,040
Well, its pretty complicated

1515
01:26:29,370 --> 01:26:33,210
If this was a normal variety show that'd definitely be cut out

1516
01:26:33,210 --> 01:26:35,980
Sure enough, these two are incredible

1517
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:39,880
Generally speaking, if nothing happens, you will be upset, right?

1518
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:45,720
But those two people are very calm, not afraid at all

1519
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:49,420
Instead of fear they're calm

1520
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:54,170
So, nothing really happened and 30 minutes passed

1521
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:59,430
It hurts when you move your feet

1522
01:26:59,430 --> 01:27:03,670
Ah, its a bit scary

1523
01:27:03,870 --> 01:27:07,480
If you move even a little, it will be very painful.
-It's true

1524
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:10,150
It is tough

1525
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:12,050
Kasuga is struggling

1526
01:27:12,050 --> 01:27:14,020
The position just now was quite good

1527
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:20,450
In order not to let the pain build up, the two move ever so slightly occasionally

1528
01:27:21,660 --> 01:27:22,860
Dancho
-Yes?

1529
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:27,340
Which is more painful, being on a bike for 24 hours or this?

1530
01:27:27,930 --> 01:27:31,070
For me, the bike is easier

1531
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:37,470
Because you are moving, its more painful to not move

1532
01:27:38,230 --> 01:27:43,500
Yes, the pain in the feet is increased with the restriction of not being able to take a single step

1533
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,440
This matchup can be said to be tough on a mental level as well

1534
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:51,200
The soles of the feet are so uncomfortable

1535
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:55,160
It is also hard to move the surface of the foot

1536
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:57,660
Constant pain

1537
01:27:58,030 --> 01:28:02,400
It hurts when you move around.
-Yeah

1538
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:04,130
You have to move although it hurts

1539
01:28:04,830 --> 01:28:08,870
The intervals between shifting become shorter

1540
01:28:09,370 --> 01:28:16,980
Honestly, I would never do this sort of thing, really, I would never do it

1541
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:24,020
I've never said no to anything before, but this, I really couldn't do it

1542
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:26,860
Not funny at all

1543
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:28,760
It is just standing

1544
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:30,490
Hate things that aren't funny

1545
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:35,730
That was close...

1546
01:28:39,980 --> 01:28:44,290
In order to reduce the pain, Kasuga spreads his weight to the edge

1547
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:47,760
But almost lost his balance

1548
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:50,530
Just like that, 2 hours passes

1549
01:28:54,650 --> 01:28:58,090
Sweaty feet.
-Right? It's obviously barefoot.

1550
01:28:58,090 --> 01:28:59,950
It's getting wet.
-It's wet

1551
01:29:00,090 --> 01:29:02,190
Ah, you're sweating just standing there?

1552
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:09,260
The soles of the feet are sweaty, the soles of the feet are so sweaty

1553
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:15,670
Ugh, it hurts too much, it hurts too much, damn it!

1554
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:15,820
So cool

1555
01:29:15,670 --> 01:29:17,570
Ah, not good, don't be so angry

1556
01:29:17,970 --> 01:29:21,040
Tsk, so irritating

1557
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:25,620
So, 2 hours and 30 minutes passes

1558
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:30,220
It's hard to stand in place for two hours
-Yes, it is

1559
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,900
It hurts...

1560
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:46,970
Even these two can not hide the pain and fatigue

1561
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:52,630
I was watching

1562
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:59,390
What time is it?
-It's about 9:40 p.m

1563
01:29:59,390 --> 01:30:00,680
9:40

1564
01:30:01,230 --> 01:30:03,060
Let them rest tomorrow

1565
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:04,200
2 hours and 20 minutes to go

1566
01:30:04,820 --> 01:30:06,860
Until Monday.
-Monday

1567
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:12,890
I'm setting a goal to make it to Monday

1568
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:16,230
Wow, no!

1569
01:30:16,230 --> 01:30:17,800
Let's celebrate a new day!

1570
01:30:18,410 --> 01:30:22,270
For the man who can continue to ride on the bike for 24 hours

1571
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:27,400
And the man who waited for 6 and a half hours without saying a word

1572
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:32,080
There is no end in sight...

1573
01:30:32,610 --> 01:30:35,180
How is Kasuga doing now? Any thoughts?

1574
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:40,620
Well, in any case, we've really stood for 3 and a half hours

1575
01:30:40,620 --> 01:30:45,190
After standing here for 3 hours, i'll never forget the shape of these rocks

1576
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:47,860
If you put it like this, it will hurt and so on

1577
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:53,200
Different places have completely different pain

1578
01:30:55,770 --> 01:30:57,170
Wow... damn it!

1579
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:10,420
Hey, why, why, why, why?
-Just now his foot moved

1580
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:13,320
Wow, a complete oversight

1581
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:17,060
Ah, really slippery feet
-Scared the hell out of me

1582
01:31:19,260 --> 01:31:22,060
It really hurts, right?
-Yes, it hurts

1583
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:24,300
Painful from the beginning

1584
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:29,740
We are competing in "endurance", so it is impossible for "no pain"

1585
01:31:29,740 --> 01:31:35,480
From the first round it was like this, there is no "not hot", it was super hot!

1586
01:31:35,780 --> 01:31:37,410
We are just holding back!

1587
01:31:37,650 --> 01:31:40,380
So in the Endurance Showdown

1588
01:31:40,780 --> 01:31:45,740
The winner is Dancho, congratualtions!

1589
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:52,890
Okay, after watching VTR, what do you think?

1590
01:31:53,030 --> 01:31:59,230
I thought i'd react like "you can do it" and "amazing!"

1591
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:02,210
But watching it I was really close to tears

1592
01:32:02,470 --> 01:32:04,510
It was really like a fight to the death

1593
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:06,820
They were so serious

1594
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:09,820
Hamada is also good at this, next time let him do it

1595
01:32:09,820 --> 01:32:11,580
Really?
-I want to see it

1596
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:14,920
Just now in the pool, they should've let them sink

1597
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:17,810
That won't work.
-You can't broadcast that

1598
01:32:18,390 --> 01:32:23,270
You want to see that, don't you? You can laugh at that, right? "They've sunk!"

1599
01:32:24,430 --> 01:32:28,760
Hamada-, are you still living 20 years in the past?

1600
01:32:28,820 --> 01:32:30,690
Yes, he is the "Comedy Time Traveler"

1601
01:32:30,690 --> 01:32:33,940
"Time Traveler"? "Back to the Future"?

1602
01:32:33,940 --> 01:32:38,010
That's right, "90 points for violence!" in those days

1603
01:32:33,940 --> 01:32:38,010
※ゲバゲバ 90 points! : A variety show broadcasted on Japanese television from 1969 to 1971
