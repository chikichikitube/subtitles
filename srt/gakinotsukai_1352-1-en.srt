Your forehead  Raise your hair

179
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,000

This is frightening

182

It's making a zappy sound

183
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,000
Look, they're charging him!

184
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,000
Yoshinobu doesn't like this as well

He got it too

188
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,560
Of course he's gonna take it too

189
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,890

From here to here

193
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,370
Wasn't it "forehead"...?

194
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,630
At the same time

195
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,570
Even down there?

196
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,570
Yeah

197
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,500
It's still running

198
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,970
That sucks so much

199
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,580
Do we still have more?

200
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,580
We do, a lot

201
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,950
Old dude garlic breath

202
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,360
Oh, this one

206
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,050
This one again?

207
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,760
I really don't like this one

208
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,930
One by one

209
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,410
From me?

210
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,410
One by one

211
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,180

Why did you flip it too?

216
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,420
He said one by one

217
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,470
They're safe...

218
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,470

It's time

226
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,680
I beg you...

227
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,550
You two, flip it at the same time

228
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,960
Spare me...

229
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,860

At the same time

232
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,520
I can't--

233
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,950

240
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,860
Matsumoto's garlic breath agony!!

241
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,760

That's the one I did not  want

248
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,440
Holy shit

249
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,840
Making noise would bother the others
they can't raise their voice no matter what

250

This isn't his first time, right?

252
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,360
I hate the old dude related ones...  Really?

253
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,840
I hate the old dude related ones...  Really?

254
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,980
Really?

255
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,140
He's eating them raw

256
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,140
Here he comes

257
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,300
He's gonna breathe through that pipe

258
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,320
Other foods would be bad too

259
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,160
He's looking pale

260
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,160
Yeah

261
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,490
Like, spicy stuff

262
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,490
That's right

263
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,190
Woah

264
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,190
Incredible

265
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,070
Can you smell that?

266
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,280
It's so much

267
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,930
And now he's gonna take it all for himself

268
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,930
Right

269
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,430
I'm done

270
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:38,560
It came to you as expected?

271
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,060
Shit

272
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,440
It's a knockout for him

273
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,680
Enough with old dudes...

274
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,280

Is Hamada the only at zero?

282
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,760
Come on...

283
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,160

00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,960
All of that?

344
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,960
At least a glass

345
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,960
It's more solid than liquid

346
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,960
It's not running down

347
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:27,000
How much?

348
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,000
That's enough

349
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,780
Try to smell it

350
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,160
Drink it up

351
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,070
You gotta be kidding me

352
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,070
Hurry up and drink

353
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,300
Come on

354
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,300
He's not drinking

355
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,240
Come on, dude

356
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,240
Not even a sip

357
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,280
What the hell...

358
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,280
You haven't drank anything yet

359
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,350
Come on, open your mouth

360
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,000
Open up

361
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:18,820
Looks like a mole here

362
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,340
Come on

363
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,740
Say "aaah"

364
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,540
It's not even pouring down

365
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,540
This sucks so bad

366
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,520
So noisy!

367
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,340
Shut your trap

368
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,740
Don't jump around, dude

369
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,910
Hey! Don't go next to the old dude, man!!

370
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,780
How is it? Bitter?

371
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,860
Like raw fish?

372
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,120
Yeah, it's like fish

373
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,120

374
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,120
Geez

375
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,560
Probably this one

376
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,860
This is the worst one

377
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,860
This is the worst one

378
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,330
Clean your face, it's all there

379
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,330
This sucks

380
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,960
There's still more...?

381
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,760
How many are left?

382
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,700
Enough, really

383
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,700
There's still a lot of them

384
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,400
Yeah, I can see that  Still far from over

385
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,200
Carbonated water from the nose

386
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,600
What the?!

387
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,840
Carbonated water from the nose

388
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,840
topic

389
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,580
This isn't going to feel good

390
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,840
Enough...

391
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,410
You should do it

392
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,280
He's still at zero?

393
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,280
It's not my fault

394
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:17,950
Only Hamada has 0 punishments

395
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,950
That's your fault, you pick your cards

396
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,250
Why should I do it if I don't pick the card myself?

397
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,000
Why should I do it if I don't pick the card myself?

398
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,450
Just one time

399
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,450
Think of it as a service

400
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,820
For free

401
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,820
"Service" my ass

402
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,300
Who's going first?

403
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,000
Tanaka

404
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,000
Tanaka

405
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,000
Tanaka

406
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,260
You're still dirty

407
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,980
Sea slug everywhere

408
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,710
Clean up

409
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,910
Matsumoto

410
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,610
Really?

411
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,380
I'm so glad...

412
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,380
Matsumoto

413
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,380
Matsumoto

414
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,380
It can't be...

415
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,550
Hosei

416
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,320
Here I go

417
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:57,150
Carbonated water from the nose

418
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:57,150
Hosei

419
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:57,150
Shh

420
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,990
He's so unlucky

421
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,320
How does it work?

422
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,320
Huh?

423
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,330
This one?

424
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,440
So primitive

425
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,120
I'm scared

426
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,120
Sit down please

427
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,600
Do I have to?

428
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,980
You ok?

429
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,810
Here I go, get ready

430
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,810
Yes

431
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,200
Ready and...

432
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,390
What the--

433
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,780
It came out from his other nostril

434
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,910
From left to right

435
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,910
It's connected

436
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,940
But maybe it's good that it flowed

437
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,050
But maybe it's good that it flowed

438
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,050
Yeah, maybe

439
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,050
I see

440
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,350
It's nose-gargling, you know

441
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,810
Yeah

442
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:02,520
With carbonated water...?

443
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,520
Well, usually that's not it, but...

444
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,750
Still, your nose is clean now

445
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,750
Yes

446
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,580
It's going to get worse now, isn't it?

447
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,390
It is

448
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,390
That's how it goes

449
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:12,330
I have a bad feeling about this

450
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,330
Scalding crêpe

451
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,000
Scalding crêpe

452
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,000
topic

453
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,370
Hosei

454
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,720
What the---

455
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:27,310
Hosei

456
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:27,310
Hosei

457
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,860
Did you just force his reveal...?

458
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,390
Is this legal?

459
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,110
What the hell are you doing?!

460
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,290
Tanaka

461
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:42,020
Scalding crêpe

462
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:42,020
Shh

463
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:42,020
Tanaka

464
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,040
You can't do this

465
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,120
But you already picked that one

466
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,120
You did, yeah

467
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,840
I know but, flipping my card and getting the punishment...

468
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,720
It was yours

469
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,700
You chose that

470
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,270
He just flipped it, you picked it yourself

471
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,270
I know, but still...

472
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,030
Look at that

473
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,070
Is it gonna be on his face?

474
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,070
That's right

475
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,110
Don't touch that

476
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,350
Oh my

477
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,180
Freshly made?

478
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,180
Yes

479
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,420
It's gonna be freshly made

480
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,050
This is crazy

481
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,520
Tanaka has been so unlucky...

482
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,790
Lie down, man

483
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,520
Do you hear the sound it's making?

484
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,520
It's gonna be fine

485
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,900
It's making noises

486
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,900
What is he gonna do with it?

487
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,660
It's gonna burn like hell

488
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,880
It's done

489
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,380
Here it comes

490
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,320
It looks so hot

491
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,520
Don't move around

492
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,500
On his face?

493
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,500
What?! Are you serious?

494
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,350
It's fine, it's fine

495
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,340
Just don't move

496
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,550
That was quick

497
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,380
Hot!

498
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,660
It's burning

499
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,720
Of course it's hot

500
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,720
Come here

501
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,700
Keep quiet

502
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,360
We have one more for you

503
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,360
He's making another one

504
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,400
Come on

505
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,880
He's already making it, so...

506
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,800
Lie down

507
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,160
They're two

508
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,160
It's two crêpes

509
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,400
For some reason

510
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,540
The punishment consists of two crêpes

511
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,540
Pay one get two, huh

512
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,660
Shhh!

513
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,270
Keep quiet

514
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,750
We still have him with zero

515
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,100
Not even once?

516
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,870
Yeah, only Hamada

517
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,960
It's just luck, nothing you can do about it

518
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,390
Alright

519
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:32,300
Here

520
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,020
You haven't flipped this yet

521
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,020
Oh, right

522
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,300
Focused

523
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,800
He's desperate

524
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,270
Monkey kick

525
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,270
Ehh?

526
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,880
This is scary

527
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,840
Monkey kick

528
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,840
topic

529
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,520
I have experienced this before

530
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,280
Is it a real monkey?

531
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,620
It is

532
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,620
I see

533
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,950
It's not my fault I'm not getting any

534
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,660
Who's gonna start?

535
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,860
Nice one

536
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,860
Hosei

537
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,870
Hosei

541
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,040
Tanaka

542
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,900
Alright!

543
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,500

Monkey kick

Ozawa

548
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:16,410
Shh

549
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,120
Oh yeah!!

550
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,850
This is a scary one

551
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,850
Are you for real?!

552
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,650
That thing is huge!

553
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,020
It's pretty big

554
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,900
Really

555
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,660
Don't make him mad

556
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,460
Hey, don't set him off

557
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,360
Don't provoke him

558
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,140
Man, monkeys are scary...

559
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,820
I'm freaking out

560
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,000
Woah, terrifying

561
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,050
Ozawa, don't piss him off please

562
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,580
He's gonna destroy you for real

563
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,520
I wonder how fast he's gonna kick him

564
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:56,720
---'s gonna kick him

565
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,490
Kinda

566
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,490
That was kinda cute

567
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,640
Huh?

568
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,860
Now I'm pissed off

569
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,610
Never been this pissed off before

570
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,610
It's humiliating

571
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,180
To be kicked by a monkey...

572
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,180
Humiliation

573
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,140
You can't even get mad at it

574
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,390
That lil bastard

575
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,820
So humiliating

576
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,590
Can't we just wrap it up?

577
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,590
I wonder how many are left

578
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:38,060
Only Hamada has 0 punishments

579
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,520
Come on, there are days you're
just lucky and don't get any

580
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,060
Next one is our last one

581
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,820
Last one?

582
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,030
Eh? Really?

583
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,030
It's not my fault, man

584
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,830
Rocket punch

585
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,830
What's this about?

586
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,830
What the-?

587
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,810
Rocket punch

588
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,810
topic

589
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,810
What should we do?

590
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,060
You go first, Ozawa

591
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,640
You've been like this from the start

592
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,450
Ozawa

593
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,320
Ozawa

594
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,320
Ozawa

595
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,750
Just flip it, Endo

596
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,590
Endo

597
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,350
Alright

598
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,350
Endo

599
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,350
Endo

600
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,260
Hosei

601
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,980
Oh yeah

602
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,400
Really?!

603
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,640
Ok, ok

604
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,300
Tanaka

605
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,270
Tanaka

606
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,270
Tanaka

607
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,580
We did it!

608
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:27,940
members left: Matsumoto Hamada

609
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,440
We can still make it after all

610
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,440
What a situation

611
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,780
Gimme a break...

612
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,940
Come on

613
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,580
It doesn't change if you just flip it now

614
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,580
I want him to have it

615
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,420
Or if we both do it at the same time

616
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,090
How should we do this?
Are we picking one?

617
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:39,490
Come on, let's pick a card

618
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,960
You're ok with that?

619
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,390
Let's count to three

620
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,430
Alright

621
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,430
I'll count for you

622
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,020
Ready? One, two and...

623
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,270
Hamada

624
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,270
Matsumoto

625
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,270
Alright!!

626
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,840
Hamada

627
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,840
Rocket punch

628
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,840
Shh

629
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,320
Such a beautiful way to end it

630
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:00,780
Hamada is gonna get a rocket punch and that thing again!

631
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,240
Perfect

632
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,780
Are you kidding me?

633
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,780
No complaints

634
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,910
Hamada

635
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,910
Matsumoto

636
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,910
Alright!!

637
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:05,480
Hamada

638
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:05,480
Rocket punch

639
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:05,480
Shh

640
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:11,120
Making noise would bother the others
they can't raise their voice no matter what

641
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:11,120
m 0 0 l -26 0 l -26 13 l 26 13 l 26 0 l 0 0

642
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,920
Such a beautiful way to end it

643
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,860
Perfect

644
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,120
Are you kidding me?

645
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,120
No complaints

646
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,630
It's just perfect

647
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:19,000
It's like that one we saw on "No-Laughing"

648
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,900
Geez...

649
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,900
It's scary

650
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,740
This one is pretty scary

651
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,740
It's gonna hurt

652
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,970
It's really powerful

653
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,970
I'm so glad

654
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,170
It's dangerous

655
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,170
He gotta wear those?

656
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,440
You don't need glasses

657
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,440
Of course I do

658
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,710
You don't!

659
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,710
I do

660
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:39,520
Ichioka Genki

661
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:39,520
the punishment will be supervised by the Denjirou crew

662
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,400
It's gonna hit you really hard

663
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,520
Woah, scary...

664
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,520
It's gonna hurt

665
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,700
Whaaat?!

666
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,420
This is too much!!

667
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,650
No way

668
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,860
That thing is gonna mess me up

669
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,670
I don't like this at all!!

670
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,000
I mean--

671
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,000
Almost there

672
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,370
I'm freaking out!!!!

673
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,250
Straight on his face

674
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:14,950
See? I told you so!!

675
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,020
See? I told you so!!

676
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,020
My stomach...

677
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,560
That was so scary

678
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,500
We've finished them all

679
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,400
I only got humiliating punishments

680
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,100
That's right

681
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,600
Kid enema

682
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,600
Monkey kick

683
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,600
Ozawa's punishments

684
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:30,860
You're right  Only humiliations

685
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,600
You're right  Only humiliations

686
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,420
The monkey and the slugs were the worst

687
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,340
Monkey kick

688
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,340
Sea slug innards juice

689
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,340
Yeah...

690
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,480
How about the garlic?

691
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,840
Old dude garlic breath

692
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:36,820
Oh, right, that one too  Yeah...

693
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,840
Oh, right, that one too  Yeah...

694
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:43,450
Wanna try the garlic yourself?

695
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,450
Wait---

696
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,150
We're not gonna air it, it's fine

697
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,150
You're not?

698
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:51,420
What do you mean you're not going to?

699
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,420
We're not gonna air it

700
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,600
No wait, give me a break

701
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,560
I didn't

702
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,290
I didn't pick any card!

703
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:58,860
I didn't pick any card!

704
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,860
I'm telling you, we're not gonna air this

705
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,860
It's fine, really

706
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:03,700
Garlic breath explosion right into Hamada!

707
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,380
I didn't pick any card!

708
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,380
We're not gonna air it

709
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,640
Hamada

710
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,640
Old dude garlic breath

711
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,640
Shh

712
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,640
It's fine, really

713
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,640
We're not gonna use it

714
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,740
We won't use it, so it's fine

715
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,740
But---

716
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,640
I mean--

717
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,640
It's not gonna be on air

718
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,870
It stinks!

719
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,920
Already?

720
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,580
Maybe it's from before

721
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,040
Here comes

722
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,040
There was a lot before

723
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,180
Was it this close before?!

724
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,180
Yup

725
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,300
Ugh

726
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,600
Here it comes

727
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,760
Here we go

728
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,240
It's mouth-to-mouth

729
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,770
Straight in his mouth

730
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,400
Look at him

731
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,400
It left a mark

732
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,020
Disgusting

733
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,370
I'm friggin' crying...

734
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,520
Wanna try the nose gargling?

735
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,620
No fucking way

736
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,450
Anything but that
