1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,120
Endo Shozo

2
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,120
Hamada Masatoshi

3
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,120
Matsumoto Hitoshi

4
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,120
Tanaka Naoki

5
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,120
Tsukitei Hosei

6
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:05,090
So, Matsumoto, we're wearing tuxedos for today, why is that?

7
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,000
Yes, yes

8
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,830
That's right

9
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,310
As for today's episode...

10
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,560
Do you know the old dude card game, right?

11
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:10,770
Of course we know it

12
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,940
It's kind of different from the old maid

13
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:27,240
Old Dude:

It's a variation of the game "old maid"
instead of the joker card, there's a single unpaired card

14
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:19,460
I wanted to try an original Gaki-game based off it

15
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,510
I'm going to hand out several paired cards to you

16
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,860
But there's a single card without a pair in the deck

17
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,450
And that's the old dude, right?

18
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,740
If you end up with it, you have to do the task written on it

19
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,240
If this turns out to be fun, we're scheduling 8 more episodes

20
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,240
8 more?!

21
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:40,790
Isn't that too much?

22
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,930
Is it really that good?

23
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,620
We're doing this for two months?!

24
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:52,620

25
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,630
Here's a new project: Gaki Old Dude Game!

26
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,260
There are different topics written on the cards

27
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,640
15 different topic-cards (total: 30)

28
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,630
These are the original Old Dude cards

29
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:07,650
Discard all the card in your hand, and you win

30
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,350
The cards will be dealt to each member

31
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:07,630
And you're done as soon as you can discard them all

32
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:13,650
Lose and you'll have to perform the demand written on it

33
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,860
If you're the last one,

34
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,630
You'll have to do the unreasonable demand written on it

35
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,260
First off, let's see who's going to be the first

36
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,290
Come here, Bunny-chan!

37
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:19,890
The first one between us?

38
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,370
That's right, we have to decide it

39
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,780
It's important, it can give you an advantage

40
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,500
Maybe, or maybe not

41
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,230
Ah, she actually has a p*ssy

42
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,360
What are you talking about?

43
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,360
It's Bunny-chan

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I thought an old dude would show up...

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,150
That would have been creepy

46
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,060
Come on, we're Gaki!

47
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,610
This is the first step

48
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,650
Choosing the leader via roulette

49
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,440
The leader is gonna take advantage

50
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,630
Yeah, that's right

51
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,640
He'll have fewer cards

52
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,060
Spin the wheel, Hamada

53
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,560
Huh? Why me?

54
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,340
It has to be him

55
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,610
Looks like it's Endo

56
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,320
I remember Endo playing old maid once

57
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:01,080
Lifting a single card up to raise suspicion,
it's a game of strategy

58
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,630
But now, you have to take 1 card out of the deck

59
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,930
Right

60
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,250
Right, right

61
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,390
And that's the old dude, right?

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,230
Just take one out

63
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,230
Randomly? Ok

64
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,440
Alright, this one

65
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,040
We're not gonna see it, right?

66
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,850
And that's the old dude

67
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,850
Of course we don't know which one is it

68
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,260
But you have to show it to the camera

69
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:26,280
Which card is the old dude?

70
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,010
Just flip it towards the camera

71
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,290
Alright, here I go

72
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,500
Alright, so we don't know it

73
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,960
Sayuri
Yoshinaga

74
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,960
Tanaka just tried to take a peek

75
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,910
I didn't don't say such things

76
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,000
You just glanced it

77
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,010
Why should I do it?!

78
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,700
You did it again?

79
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,690
I did not!

80
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,250
Come on guys, let's do this

81
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,820
I think that if Tanaka would go to a bank,
they won't lend him any money

82
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,030
What are you talking about?
- They don't trust him

83
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,040
Do you really see me like that?

84
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,020
What is this show trying to turn me in?

85
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,210
We now have 29 total cards in the deck

86
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,210
That's right

87
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,060
We're all getting 6 cards

88
00:02:52,420 --> 00:03:00,760
6 cards for each player (leader gets 5)

89
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,520
But Endo is the leader, so he'll take 5 instead

90
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,850
That's how we start the game

91
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm pumped for this round

92
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And that's it

93
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,990
I'd hate first rounds...

94
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,050
We'll follow this order

95
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,280
There's an illustration and a name

96
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,510
Wait a minute

97
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,260
The theme of this round is "my memories with stars"

98
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:21,410
My memories with stars

99
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,880
I never met any of them

100
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,300
There's a load of people in here

101
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,710
Cool, isn't it?

102
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,690
Me too, I haven't met most of them

103
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:25,760
That's even better

104
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,850
So, if you lose this round...

105
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,590
You have to come up with a made up memory

106
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,060
I see...

107
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,780
The loser will face the camera by himself

108
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,430
And will start telling his own story

109
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,430
I really hate those

110
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,190
You already have one pair?!

111
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,630
Ah, Tatsuro Yamashita?!

112
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,060
We got a pair out already

113
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,980
Nakajima Miyuki too?

114
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,800
Oh boy

115
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,960
We have two great characters out already...

116
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,170
That's right, we have stars from different worlds

117
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,880
You can talk about their field of activity,
without saying their names

118
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,530
Alright, Endo, you go first

119
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,050
Between the ones I have in my hand...

120
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,560
They're all from different worlds...

121
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,200
I only ever met one of them

122
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,560
I think... two? Maybe?

123
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,200
What about you, Hosei?

124
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,430
I never met any of them

125
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,430
I also have a lot of foreigners...

126
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,100
There are even foreigners?

127
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,840
Foreigners?

128
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,890
I have one woman, all the others
are sportsmen and such

129
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,210
I don't know much about mine

130
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,440
Really?

131
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,650
I think I have met one of them, at least

132
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,320
And you never met the others?

133
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,320
That's right

134
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,140
If Hamada says he never met those, we're screwed

135
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,720
Sorry but I have a pair too

136
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,400
What took you so long?!

137
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,970
Come on man, there's a picture,
you should have noticed it before!

138
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,440
Also, Justin Bieber?!

139
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:59,010
Endo 5 cards

140
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:59,010
Hamada 4 cards

141
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:59,010
Hosei 6 cards

142
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:59,010
Matsumoto 4 cards

143
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:59,010
Tanaka 4 cards

144
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:59,010
If you lose, you have to come up with a fake story with that star

145
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,720
Lose and you'll have to tell a fake story,

146
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,020
It's time for old dude's game - "my memories with stars"

147
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,220
Do you have anything good?

148
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,940
We should show them to the camera

149
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,930
That's right

150
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,570
Let's show them all

151
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,750
Is...

152
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,830
Is this ok?

153
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,440
staff) it's fine

154
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,910
Why do I have these many cards?

155
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,270
But he's about to take one from yours

156
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,380
So many cards

157
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,780
You'd end up having the whole deck

158
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,040
Yeah, probably

159
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,200
It doesn't look good for me

160
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,800
Is that the card you had?

161
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,240
Exactly

162
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,490
So many cards

163
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,850
I'm glad he took it!

164
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,200
Who's gonna lose?

165
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,090
I have no clue which one to pick

166
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,220
The hell is this roster?

167
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,660
They're all different stars!

168
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:48,160
Of course they are, they have to be unpaired

169
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,810
What should we do?

170
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:52,550
Alright, let me take one card...

171
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,150
This is strange...

172
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:01,360
The stake is high, we gotta make up a story...

173
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,300
I'm not familiar with this guy

174
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,900
This guy over there...

175
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,770
It's this guy again!

176
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,370
He's back!

177
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,370
He's wandering around

178
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,100
Who's wandering around?

179
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,120
I don't know

180
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,650
What the hell is going on?

181
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:23,890
I have no clue

182
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,320
This is going so bad, what the heck?

183
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,000
Really...
- Right

184
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,630
What the fuck?!

185
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,500
At least we took those out

186
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,390
Yeah, at least those
- Ok, but...

187
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,600
Alright, I'll pick this

188
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,990
This is incredible

189
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,060
- Your turn, Endo

190
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,030
Man, I want to draw a pair so bad...

191
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,400
Did you draw it?

192
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,610
- Wow! Are they there too?!

193
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,840
Still new cards?

194
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,840
- Of course

195
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,340
Really, this one...

196
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,370
Do you know them?

197
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,400
I don't know them at all

198
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,920
You thought they weren't even in the deck

199
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,180
I see... so this person was here too

200
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:06,700
None of them seem to be drawing any pair...

201
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,000
Again

202
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,110
Oh man

203
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,370
This one

204
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,720
It's back again

205
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,610
Really?

206
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,410
That guy is running around in circles

207
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:30,160
Another important point

208
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,160
But there's another important point in this game

209
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,240
While we're playing this, to be honest

210
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,280
You think about an episode, right?

211
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,410
Right     - Right

212
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,900
And you're like "oh, I should go for this one"

213
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,440
And then someone takes that card from you

214
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,770
And you're like "that's MY card"!

215
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,560
Yeah, you make up this good story

216
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,370
and then someone snatches it away

217
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,840
I totally get you

218
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,930
Come on guys, let's keep going

219
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,930
Here's a pair

220
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,790
He's been doing great

221
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,150
But I'm glad this guy's out

222
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,220
Yeah, Ou-san...

223
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,380
What? I see...

224
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,370
One pair and you're done

225
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,280
'Cause he already drew two pairs

226
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,260
Right

227
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,100
Sorry about that

228
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,060
This is irritating

229
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,640
Here it is!

230
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,560
He's finally out!    - It's Tiger Woods!

231
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,760
This would have been bad

232
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,400
Yeah, totally

233
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,360
Nice one, now we're playing

234
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,240
I still have no clue

235
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,890
Oh man

236
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,130
Now I'm getting scared

237
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,100
This isn't coming to an end

238
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,850
It's time to end this

239
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,280
You really suck at making pairs

240
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,280
I'd love to end this, but...

241
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,430
Come on, Endo

242
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,140
I've never seen this person before

243
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,200
Oh my god...

244
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,250
Really, it's my first time seeing this card

245
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,820
The first of them to clear his cards up...

246
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,700
Let's see if... oh!

247
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,340
I'm clear!

248
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,970
Here, I'm done!

249
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,590
Let's move on

250
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,490
I'm the first one

251
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,980
And not only him...

252
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,620
Matsumoto, please...

253
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,250
What the hell, dude...

254
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,090
I did it!

255
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,090
It's this guy again!

256
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,030
He's back!

257
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,690
And even Maezawa, the card which tormented Hamada...

258
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,710
And that leaves only Cocorico

259
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,710
It's down to the two of us

260
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,530
And if Tanaka makes a pair now...

261
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,720
If he pulls it off...

262
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,800
Let's see...

263
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,500
Wait a second! Wait, wait, wait...

264
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,500
Ready?
- No, give me a sec

265
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,920
Which one is it gonna be?

266
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,120
Yeah, I don't know

267
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,720
What should I do? My memories with them...

268
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,380
As soon as you lose, you gotta start your story

269
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,380
Get your episode ready

270
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,230
Which one is it?

271
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,620
Who is it?

272
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,400
I wonder...

273
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,210
Let's see who's the old dude

274
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,460
It was this lady

275
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:59,400
So it was miss Sayuri Yoshinaga...

276
00:10:02,050 --> 00:11:49,190
Endo's memory with Sayuri Yoshinaga

277
00:10:02,050 --> 00:11:49,190
Endo's memory with Sayuri Yoshinaga

278
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:07,320
If I remember correctly it was... last year? I guess?

279
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,300
At least I think so

280
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,100
Anyway, as you know I like golf and I often play it

281
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:18,490
And one day Miss Yoshinaga's group played before mine

282
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:23,300
So I kept on playing while glancing at them

283
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,080
It may sound rude, but I don't think she was a skilled player

284
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,640
Her group's play was really slow

285
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,840
We were about to catch them up, so

286
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,950
We thought we should say them something, but

287
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:41,020
I was wondering what to do, and then...

288
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,450
I just... hit my ball

289
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:48,350
And the ball flew so fast and hit

290
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:51,640
Miss Yoshinaga's head

291
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,660
And she got really angry at me

292
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:01,050
I apologized as soon as it happened

293
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:05,120
And it felt like everything was good

294
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,120
Then, I went out to lunch

295
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,060
The hell is he talking about?

296
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,050
Such a long story, huh?

297
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,970
And I played the next course

298
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:17,210
And when I did, I hit my ball, I shanked

299
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,140
And I hit Miss Yoshinaga again, right above her left eye

300
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:26,320
And again, she really got mad at me

301
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,330
This isn't going to end

302
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,180
He's stuck

303
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,550
He is

304
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,650
And I... apologized

305
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,220
It's pitch black ahead

306
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,820
There's no escape road inside his head

307
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:37,700
But then, in the end...

308
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,700
Is that ever going to end?

309
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,900
I told her "it's not like I hate you or anything"

310
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,960
And then we all had dinner together, that's it

311
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,600
Thank you

312
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,820
Were you planning this episode for Tiger Woods?

313
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:59,310
This episode isn't real, Endo came up with it

314
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,480
It makes sense, with Tiger Woods

315
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,240
You were planning it with someone else, right?

316
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,020
Were, there are lots of sportsmen, so...

317
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,840
To be honest yeah, I was thinking about Tiger Woods

318
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:10,030
And then he disappeared,
but I couldn't get "golf" out of my mind...

319
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,640
Just as we thought

320
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,160
I didn't expect it would have been Yoshinaga

321
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,240
It's probably the farthest from him...

322
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:18,450
Yeah, she is

323
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,980
How about we try again with the same cards?

324
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,460
Let's go for another round

325
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,470
With the same cards?

326
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,820
The same as this round?

327
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:31,300
My memories with stars - 2 -

328
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,980
The old dude changes, right?

329
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,600
Of course

330
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,170
Oh boy...

331
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,280
Alright, let's chose our leader first

332
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,770
Let's roll

333
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,010
I'm not ready for this

334
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,630
You do the honors, Endo

335
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,010
Alright

336
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,340
It barely spun...

337
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,290
But I guess it's ok

338
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,620
I get you, Endo, after telling that story

339
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,620
Sorry, I haven't done this before

340
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,850
You're in a feverish state, I get you

341
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,420
Thanks for your concern

342
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,420
You should go home and think about it

343
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,420
But now you're stuck in here

344
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:00,010
Spinning the roulette made me nervous

345
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,240
There's no time to not feel tense

346
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,460
You've been dragged here, face it

347
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:04,980
Yeah

348
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,810
Here's the second round of the game!

349
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:10,470
The old dude is Bae Yong-joon

350
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,140
Let's be faster this time

351
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,570
Sure, here goes

352
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,440
It's Yumiko Udo!

353
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,600
He's good at this

354
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,600
A story with a woman is harder

355
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,540
I agree

356
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,540
I'd rather come up with a guy

357
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,980
We have more cards this round...

358
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,480
A part of me hopes it's Endo with Yoshinaga again...

359
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,220
Anything but that

360
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,690
You're screwed if you pick her now

361
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,840
Right

362
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,920
You barely even had the strength to spin the roulette

363
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,370
Please, don't

364
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:52,780
A Quick turn of events

365
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,760
But suddenly, a quick turn of events!

366
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,340
He did it again!

367
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,670
Hamada is the first one to clear

368
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,110
You're good to go, Hamada

369
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,800
I'm good at this

370
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,740
Oh yeah!

371
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,400
Really? Man...

372
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,410
Are you kidding me?

373
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,600
He's done too

374
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,370
Oh man...

375
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,650
Give that to him, not me

376
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,240
Oh yeah!

377
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,190
Really?!

378
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,290
No way...

379
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,710
At this point I swear

380
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,530
I'm fine with Endo's hell

381
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,660
It's fifty-fifty now

382
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,180
Please, give me a break...

383
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,170
I'm panicking

384
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,760
Please... please!

385
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,090
Please don't match!

386
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:36,080
You're so unlucky, man

387
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,520
Now it's Yamazaki's chance

388
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,460
Give me a minute! Please!

389
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,750
I swear, what the heck!

390
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,730
It's looking bad for you, Shozo!

391
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,960
Something's wrong!

392
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,530
I swear, what the heck!

393
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,880
It's looking bad for you, Shozo!

394
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,890
This is a joke, right? A joke

395
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,070
But look

396
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,940
I have 2 out of 3 chances to win

397
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,180
Right, that's right

398
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,830
What should I do?

399
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,250
As long as you don't draw the old dude

400
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,560
I haven't thought of a story yet...

401
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,120
Why am I always...?

402
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,370
How is it?

403
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:23,550
And here we go, draw your last card, Endo

404
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,950
Wait, gimme a sec

405
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,560
We don't know which one is it

406
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,620
Right

407
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,290
It's one of them, but who?

408
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:30,290
Let's see

409
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,960
I have no clue about them both

410
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,320
Endo, come on

411
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,580
You gotta move fast, it's a matter of momentum

412
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,020
Quick, come on!
- Don't think! One, two, and go!

413
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,660
It's Bae Yong-joon

414
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,870
Please, tell us your memory!

415
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:51,870
Well, I think it was...

416
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:57,280
Around the time I came here to Tokyo,
I lived in front of this guy

417
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:02,640
We used to grab lunch together too

418
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,210
It was a time where we both didn't have much job to do

419
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:09,720
And so we were constantly supporting each other

420
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:13,420
But then we gained success, right?

421
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:18,660
I started to sell and I invited him out for lunch

422
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:23,560
And even today we exchange messages on LINE

423
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,380
That's our relationship, good memories

424
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,020
Thank you

425
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,900
It's a made-up story

426
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:34,240
That barely felt like a memory

427
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,570
He didn't get ready at all

428
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,390
Nothing at all

429
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,540
I don't know what to say

430
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,620
Are you ok today?

431
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,760
You want me to drive you home?

432
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,870
Are you ok? Can you get back home?

433
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:53,760
Let's dive into our next theme, shall we?

434
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,100
Bunny-chan, please

435
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,940
She's our Bunny-chan, thank you

436
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,720
How many games are there?!

437
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,990
What's wrong, Bunny-chan?

438
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,660
What's going on? You laughed...

439
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,260
Did he do something to you?

440
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,410
He just...

441
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,920
What's going on?

442
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,920
Come on, tell us

443
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,490
What's going on?

444
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,460
Please

445
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,370
His eyes...

446
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:14,770
Were around here

447
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,200
You're the shittiest of shits

448
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,240
Was he really looking around there?

449
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,040
He's the king of shit

450
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,200
What can I do about it? I saw her coming!

451
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,760
Of course I'm going to peek at her

452
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,420
But that's not the spot you'd look

453
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,420
It felt that normal to you?

454
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:32,100
He's a high-quality shit comedian

455
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,190
Yeah, really

456
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,610
That's unbelievable

457
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,870
Sorry about that

458
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,730
I'm sorry

459
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,530
This round's theme is...

460
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,530
Batsu-game!

461
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,560
No way, why that?!

462
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,190
This isn't a fun experience at all!

463
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,740
You thought we were going to have fun?

464
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,760
Of course

465
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,300
If you lose, you'll receive the batsu-game!

466
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:58,490
Translated Batsu-game list
@ shionnotsukai.wordpress.com

467
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:58,490
This time we won't reveal the old dude,
try to guess it yourself!

468
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,930
Is this what we're doing?

469
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,090
I hate all of them!

470
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,370
Those are really something.

471
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:07,180
This can't be good!

472
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,970
Really

473
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,690
I have one pair

474
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,410
Oh, already?

475
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,440
"Hot vinegar eyedrops"

476
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,520
This sucks

477
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,140
Eh? What does that mean?

478
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,920
"Electric Spicy Pie"

479
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,920
I don't know what it means

480
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,100
I don't know most of mine myself

481
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,890
I've never seen some of those

482
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,970
Really, they're unknown

483
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,160
I didn't know about them

484
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,450
I agree, some of these are odd

485
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,650
I've never even imagined some of these

486
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,010
They're new, aren't they?

487
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,050
"Leather Belt Slap"

488
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,050
I'd hate to receive this one...

489
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:40,870
What face is that?!

490
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:44,800
But I agree, I hate them all

491
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,910
This game sucks

492
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,920
Yeah, it's no fun

493
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,500
What were they thinking when they printed this?

494
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,130
Really...

495
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,910
Please, give me one pair!

496
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,370
"Face crepe"

497
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,370
Hamada would love this one

498
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,240
I still have no clue
- Me neither

499
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,040
Oh, here it is

500
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,180
Please, don't...

501
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,170
This is is, it's my most feared one

502
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,960
I don't know what that means

503
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:19,070
"Electric Spicy Pie"

504
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,610
I know, right?!

505
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,070
"Electric spicy pie"...

506
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,520
What does that mean?

507
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,690
Sounds like a cake from the future

508
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,850
The old-dude batsu-game no one wants to face...

509
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,460
Can I?

510
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,600
And once again, suspicion is raised upon that man...

511
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,310
This card must be somewhere

512
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,920
It could be

513
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,930
Of course

514
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:41,580
Maybe someone snatched it from you

515
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:42,020
I bet it was you

516
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,710
Is it the one I took before?

517
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,080
You're always peeking at my cards

518
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,640
You took my card while peeking at my hand

519
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,920
That's not...

520
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,250
No way I would do it!

521
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,920
How could I've done it?

522
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,610
There's a camera behind me

523
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,450
You've been caught on tape!

524
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,920
Play the tape, I don't mind

525
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,090
Always peeking around, geez...

526
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,620
That's impossible!

527
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,180
Then how is this card still here, huh?!

528
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,890
That's not true

529
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,210
Are you sure?

530
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,700
That's the point of the game

531
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,370
Hey! I had this card before!

532
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,370
Your act sucks!

533
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,360
That can happen

534
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,200
It's looping

535
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,580
Suspicions from Tanaka's peeking haven't lifted

536
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,520
This is getting harsh

537
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,010
Let's see...

538
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,240
Don't peek at me

539
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:28,140
I'm not, how could I?!

540
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,690
Just don't look over there

541
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,690
He's right Tanaka, you should stop that

542
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,420
Really, he's right

543
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,620
You're better than this, Tanaka

544
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:39,120
At this point, you should just confess
- Yeah, he's right

545
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,380
Let's just play the game, guys

546
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,830
Are you changing the topic?

547
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,770
Alright, we're good, let's stop for now

548
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,770
Alright then, I'm drawing

549
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,060
The same cards are just spinning around

550
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:56,560
"Thai-kick on your back"

551
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,570
Is this one here too?

552
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,220
This card, here of all places?

553
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,160
It's a classic, you know

554
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,470
I expected this one to be here

555
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:08,280
"Thai-kick on your back"

556
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,290
Ah, this one?

557
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,280
What the hell?

558
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:11,150
I don't think there's such rule in Muay Thai

559
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:13,740
"Thai-kick on your back"

560
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,330
Yeah, I don't think so

561
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,910
I mean, on your back

562
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,820
Who's going to be the first one to clear his round?

563
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,140
Thanks so much
- Are you clear?

564
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,350
I'm done

565
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,330
"Nipple shock"

566
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,330
Alright, Endo's clear

567
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,180
He's not getting punished for his stories before?

568
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,900
I'm so glad

569
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,480
And then, it's Matsumoto's turn

570
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,580
Alright!

571
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,420
"Face crepe"

572
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,420
Thanks, "face crepe"!

573
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,910
I survived!

574
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,880
And then it's peepy Tanaka's turn

575
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,820
I'm in danger

576
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,030
I've never seen this card before

577
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:49,350
"Turban shell's guts juice"

578
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,160
"Turban shell's guts juice", ugh...

579
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,140
Is Hamada going to be punished?

580
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,340
Or it'll be Hosei?

581
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,550
The possibilities it could be Hamada are high

582
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,440
Of course there are, no need to tell me

583
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,940
Let's see...

584
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,680
Well, it's not like

585
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,930
We're going to see a loser on the next round

586
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,760
Yeah, but there's a 50% chance to win

587
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,240
So it's pretty high
- Yes, it won't last long

588
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,250
Please, don't take  it

589
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,170
I see, it's Hamada's turn, so Yamazaki's in danger

590
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:16,120
Please, don't pick it
- He's in a bad position now

591
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,960
70% chance

592
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,360
Right, 75% to be precise

593
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,010
This one!

594
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:27,350
Here!

595
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,720
"Leather belt slap"

596
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,720
Here's the leather belt!

597
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,940
He escaped it

598
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,690
No way!

599
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,570
So that means...

600
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,390
I hate both of them!

601
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,960
What are...

602
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,600
Let's see... one is "Sumo Wrestler Deep Kiss",

603
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,960
The other one is "Uvula toothbrush"
man! They both suck

604
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,960
Never seen that one before...

605
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,300
Wait a minute

606
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:48,280
Did you just say "I've never seen it"?

607
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,080
You were talking about the uvula thingy, huh?!

608
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,250
Hamada did it again

609
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,430
Who cares? He's getting it anyway

610
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:59,410
That's true

611
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,530
"Uvula toothbrush"

612
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,530
It was "uvula toothbrush"

613
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,540
What the hell is that?

614
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,590
Here comes

615
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,410
This is scary

616
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:13,040
Come on, guys... this is gonna leave scars

617
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:17,610
Open your mouth wide

618
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:20,580
Widely, open it

619
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,270
That's not enought, right?

620
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,280
I agree with you

621
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,960
Not enough

622
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,340
More?!

623
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,340
Yeah, I mean... it's a punishment

624
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:46,710
Alright, take care

625
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,370
What are you doing, man?

626
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,190
He did it three times

627
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:52,860
Who are you, Mori Shinichi?!

628
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,840
You became Mori Shinichi!

629
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,210
He changed

630
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:09,850
