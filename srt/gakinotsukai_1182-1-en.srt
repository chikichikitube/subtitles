00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,460
Kiki - Chili Oil!

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,320
This is the 34th episode.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,040
Pretty impressive, right?

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,960
We've ALWAYS used that same backdrop.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:24,930
That's true...

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,100
The person who drew it might not be even alive anymore!

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,820
So this time, Yamazaki's filled with confidence.

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,650
"It's chili oil, shouldn't this go well?" he says...

11
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,540
Isn't this really hard?

12
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,190
It is hard!

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,790
No, look at these...

14
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,450
They're completely, you know...

15
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,160
Well, the appearance is different.

16
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:47,000
So say it here! Blabbering mindlessly before the title call...

17
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,270
He pissed off people before the cameras started rolling.

18
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,380
Actually...

19
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,940
My confidence is crumbling!

20
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,060
So, how shall we begin?

21
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:10,690
What should we do?

22
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,000
Hamada, couldn't you start?

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,670
Should I go? Okay, so let us start!

24
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,400
Kiki - Chili Oil.

25
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,240
First, the one holding the best
success-rate, a six time winner, Hamada.

26
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:30,390
First item comes from restaurants of Nagoya,
Kaburaya Group's "Daruma Chili Oil".

27
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,730
The sample comes like this...

28
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,630
This time it's just the oil.

29
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,790
What!? Are you kidding? So that's why...

30
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,080
No, no, no, no, no...

31
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,440
Earlier, there were various chips in it,
like garlic chips or something...

32
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,370
But now, they have been removed.

33
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,360
In one spoonful, there's just oil.

34
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,360
There's only that.

35
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,360
You must savour it.

36
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,810
You're nose is already in it, you idiot...

37
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,680
It's totally on your nose!

38
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:55,840
Sorry, sorry...

39
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,190
This isn't "Nose Oil"...

40
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,530
I can't see like this, so...

41
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,110
This isn't "Nose Oil", you know...

42
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,910
I guess so...

43
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,050
Even from the midst of darkness, he retorts.

44
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,060
Ah, he ate it!

45
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,050
Here we go...

46
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,360
Uwa, what's up with this?
This is just plain oil!

47
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,540
Who the hell could remember this!?

48
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,510
This is what you have to guess.

49
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,070
Where should I start with all these?

50
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,450
It was just oil!

51
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,620
It's hard, isn't it?

52
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:29,390
Well, for now... I'll start with Momoya.

53
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,680
Speaking of them...

54
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,180
Well, Momoya, you know, really...

55
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,600
They've been on the dinner tables for decades...

56
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,280
We have been in their care, right?

57
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,760
It starts here...

58
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,090
How is it?

59
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,700
Ah - this isn't it!

60
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,300
He can tell it...

61
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,670
I feel like it wasn't this spicy.

62
00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:00,830
Also, the saltiness... and there wasn't
much of a smell so this must not be it.

63
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,830
The oil I ate...

64
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,480
Momoya's...

65
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,200
"Seems strong, but isn't; Mildly Strong Chili Oil"
WAS NOT IT!

66
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,310
So you can tell the difference?

67
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,720
Yes.

68
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,110
It's just that when Hamada said "This isn't it!",

69
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,940
"Huh!? He can tell it!?"

70
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,940
could you stop going like

71
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,160
That was unforgivable.

72
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,940
Eh - did I really...

73
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,810
You TOTALLY said it.

74
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,910
"He can tell it..." you said.

75
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,200
Really... I was also surprised...

76
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,940
"What's up with that reaction?" I thought.

77
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,460
This is the 34th episode!

78
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:37,690
After this, he continues to seperate the tastes
and easily clears two in a row!

79
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:41,910
...Okinawa Chili Oil" WAS IT!
Oops... WASN'T IT!

80
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,020
No, that was out, wasn't it?

81
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,190
What's up with you!?

82
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,280
He was fooling around with the "was not it" from the start!

83
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,230
And then he fumbled with his words, what a pathetic conclusion.

84
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,010
He had so many still left...

85
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,010
I'll go from this end.

86
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,350
Maiko is an apprentice geisha.

87
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,350
Ochanokosaisai's "Maiko-han Hii Hii Chili Oil".

88
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,560
Would maiko serve that?

89
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,500
So I guess you aren't a maiko?

90
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,180
Strrrong!

91
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,950
"Strrrong!"

92
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:23,330
The oil I ate, Ochanokosaisai's "Maiko-han Hii Hii Chili Oil" WAS NOT IT!

93
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,210
That's four cleared.

94
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,450
Could I have some water?

95
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,310
Was it that strong?

96
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:29,780
Strong, strong.

97
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,460
Well there must be few strong ones among those.

98
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,590
Must be, right?

99
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,710
Woah, this one is also Ochanokosaisai!

100
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:35,750
The same one?

101
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,140
Yeah, the manufacturer.

102
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,520
STRRRONG!

103
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,580
I shouldn't have eaten these!

104
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,350
Was it really that strong?

105
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,540
You'd want to eat it with rice...

106
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,430
SHARRRAP!

107
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,210
"Sharrap!" he says...

108
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,210
"Sharrap!"

109
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,210
"Sharrap!"

110
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,210
"Sharrap!"

111
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,210
"SHARRAP!"

112
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,000
...is what he said.

113
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,810
When you'd want to make the horse accelerate...

114
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,120
...a command or something.

115
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,470
A horse would run so fast!

116
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:23,700
This one isn't that hot, but at the end it lacks
that kind of an "escaping" feeling...

117
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,660
We have no idea what you're talking about.

118
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,750
I guess so.

119
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,880
THIS ISN'T IT!!

120
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,940
The final "escape" isn't there!

121
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,700
He's really emotionally unstable.

122
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,080
The oil I ate, Ochanokosaisai "Kyou Chili Oil" WAS NOT IT!

123
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,040
That one, too...

124
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,440
A sign of the male menopause...

125
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,000
Emotional unstability!

126
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,810
Chikuzen Tanaka Aburaya.

127
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,640
Oh? It didn't smell like this...

128
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,420
This is close.

129
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,870
REALLY close...

130
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,250
I wish it would have that "escaping" feeling, though...

131
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,420
H- He's just making faces!

132
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,620
Stop fooling around!

133
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,240
He's trying out all sorts of things, isn't he?

134
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,920
Ah, just what should I do? What should I do?

135
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,870
Is this it?

136
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,880
I can't drink any more oil than this!

137
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,920
You don't have to drink, just licking should be fine.

138
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:46,190
No, when you'll do this you'll understand.
All those strong ones will get to your throat.

139
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,550
They're so strong.

140
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,720
Which one is it?

141
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,540
You wanna to stop or keep going?

142
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:59,160
It's all right, sorry for taking so long.

143
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,800
I'll go with this!

144
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,140
I'm pretty sure this is it.

145
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,490
This... lack of taste.

146
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,600
The oil I ate...
Chikuzen Tanaka Aburaya....

147
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,410
"Ah! Hot Chili Oil!",

148
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,730
WAS THIS!

149
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:18,600
Come!

150
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,600
Please... I beg...

151
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,400
Seriously?

152
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,300
A foreigner...

153
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,970
This is scary! Scary!

154
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,890
A machine!

155
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,840
Where should I stand? Here?

156
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:40,960
Setting up the chili oil...

157
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,670
Should I roll the apron?

158
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,490
You damned TOAD!

159
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,940
Toad?

160
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,550
Looks painful...

161
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,460
A toad?

162
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,320
A toad!

163
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,920
A toad!

164
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,880
"Daruma Chili Oil"?

165
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,290
So, you see...

166
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,700
"Daruma Chili Oil"

167
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,450
You didn't come by it.

168
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,140
Isn't this the worst pattern?

169
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,590
It is the worst.

170
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,670
This isn't it.

171
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,000
That's one evil looking face!

172
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,720
The second challenger is Tanaka.

173
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:25,550
His goal is Chikuzen Tanaka Aburaya's "Ah! Hot Chili Oil".

174
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,300
Why did we have to something this difficult?

175
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,730
Right, but if we added the chips...

176
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:35,550
Woah, this is much more oil-like than I expected!

177
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,360
Do you usually eat chili oil?

178
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,670
Usually, I put it in gyouza, but...

179
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:43,320
What?

180
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,780
"But..." what?

181
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,350
So, who hit you just now?

182
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,080
Hamada.

183
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,050
Well, that's correct.

184
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,930
When hit, he gives an instant answer.

185
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,860
Hamada insisted that this was really strong...

186
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,660
This "Hii Hii Chili Oil".

187
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,530
I'd like to try this one.

188
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,660
The smell is different.

189
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,860
I think I can tell even without eating.

190
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,210
His face looks odd...

191
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,100
The smell is different!

192
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,060
His "drama" face.

193
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,640
His "acting" face.

194
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,240
Like he's reading his lines.

195
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,680
Strong! The flavor is different.

196
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:28,660
The oil I ate... "Maiko-han Hii Hii Chili Oil" WAS NOT IT!

197
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,130
Seemed pretty strong...

198
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,130
Yes! It was ridiculously strong.

199
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:37,560
Momoya's "Seems strong, but isn't; Mildly Strong Chili Oil" WAS NOT IT!

200
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,810
Trusting on the sample's flavor, he tells them apart splendidly!

201
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,230
Four successive clears!

202
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:52,030
I'm trying to pinpoint them, but...

203
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,730
...still not hitting it?

204
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,710
Ochanokosaisai's another one, here I go.

205
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,160
"Kyou Chili Oil".

206
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,570
Not bad.

207
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,230
The smell...

208
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,000
It's close.

209
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,010
I can't tell his feelings anymore...

210
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,120
It's a one man play.

211
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,980
Aoyama Amphitheather.

212
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,900
But I still can't get what he's trying to express.

213
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,830
His tickets aren't selling at all, it seems.

214
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,570
Because it's so hard to tell!

215
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,500
Seriously, what's up with you?

216
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,530
That's not it.

217
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,420
EXACTLY...

218
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,160
...the same amount of spiciness.

219
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,370
No doubt.

220
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,860
The oil I ate...

221
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,570
"Kyouto"...

222
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,080
"Kyou Chili Oil" WAS THIS!

223
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,850
You had no doubts, huh?

224
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:31,050
I thought that was it!

225
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,560
Is that so?

226
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,720
So I thought that Tanaka was amazing! But that wasnt it, right?

227
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,880
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

228
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,220
I thought he really hit it!

229
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,250
Are you kidding?

230
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,690
Scary...

231
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,320
Your hair...

232
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
...is greasier than chili oil!

233
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,250
That was dangerous!

234
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,640
Try eating that one, the correct answer.

235
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,030
I thought Tanaka totally had it...

236
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,320
So it was the third one!

237
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,920
No, it's different....

238
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,980
But you had absolutely no noubts, right?

239
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,720
I had not, when I picked this.

240
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,900
Impossible!

241
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,800
Hopeless!

242
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,290
Without chips, it's impossible!

243
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,490
Put the chips in! Chips!

244
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,010
That's not possible. Not happening!

245
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:30,110
Next one is Housei, who hasn't guessed right in nine years.

246
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:34,700
The target is Asahi "Gudakusan Okinawa Chili Oil".

247
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:38,790
Among us, I think I'm the one eating the most.

248
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:43,790
Ah, you mean chili oil?
It seems like you've been really hooked on that stuff.

249
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,710
Oh? What's that?

250
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,630
Isn't that Ijirii Okada?

251
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:55,810
A comedian, best known for being the MC of Gilgamesh Night

252
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:54,740
Fast!

253
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,850
You're ripping him off, aren't you?

254
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:01,120
I really like it and eat it all the time, but...

255
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,720
I... really think it's this one.

256
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,710
So you already have this in your fridge?

257
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:14,530
You already ate it?

258
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,040
Yes.

259
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,040
Can I go for it?

260
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,150
Are you serious?

261
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,020
I'm sorry.

262
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,770
This is it!

263
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,880
Is it really alright?  Like the footage and stuff...

264
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:37,540
But it's fine, right? If I'll say it's "wrong" on purpose...

265
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,440
It's alright? Well then, this time..

266
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,530
I'll bring this.

267
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,630
Thank you very much!

268
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,740
The oil I ate...

269
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:56,330
Momoya's "Seems strong, but isn't; Mildly Strong Chili Oil".

270
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,330
WAS THIS!

271
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,990
Techno boy. Techno child.

272
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,640
Not cool.

273
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,610
This time, no paycheck.

274
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:19,310
If you say that was you doing your work, I can't stand it!

275
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,580
Wait a minute, really?

276
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:30,820
Your guess and jokes totally bombed!

277
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,430
It hurts!

278
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,720
It hurts! It really hit the target!

279
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,720
If it hits the right place, it truly hurts, right?

280
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,310
Trying to extend your screentime?

281
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,390
Quit it, we don't need that.

282
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,270
We just go without much footage of you.

283
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,430
You extended your screentime just now.

284
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:51,160
Your Chouno habits took over again.

285
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,670
You're doing the same thing with Chouno.

286
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,930
Kiki Chili Oil

287
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:04,010
Endou's target is Momoya's "Seems strong, but isn't; Mildly Strong Chili Oil"

288
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,650
He took quite a load.

289
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,760
How is it?

290
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,290
Is it strong?

291
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,890
Woah, it's really mild.

292
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,630
Not strong, at all.

293
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,860
Isn't eating with your index finger dirty?

294
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,820
Right?

295
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,090
They say that Endou's index finger is even dirtier than your average.

296
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:37,180
I'll try this one with garlic,
Gyokaikei's "Reclaimed Land Chili Oil".

297
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,500
Different. Ah, this...

298
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:54,260
..traditional Japanese taste really kicks in so it's completely different.

299
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,810
The oil I ate "Reclaimed Land Chili Oil" WAS NOT IT.

300
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:06,310
After this, Endou easily clears one after another.

301
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,570
Well then, excuse me for a moment.

302
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,440
So, after that it's...

303
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,410
"Seems strong, but really isn't; Mildly Strong Chili Oil".
Here I go!

304
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,180
I wonder if this is too audacious.

305
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:27,010
Maybe it's too audacious, but I have a feeling that Momoya should be also appearing soon.

306
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,090
But having a prejudice like that isn't good.

307
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:34,340
After all, it's a battle of tongues.

308
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,210
This isn't about human relationships.

309
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,540
He's really desperate to get his footage used!

310
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,550
No, but this is different. Here I go!

311
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:54,150
The oil I ate, Momoya's "Seems strong, but isn't; Mildly Strong Chili Oil" WAS NOT IT!

312
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,700
Now THIS is the worst!

313
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,560
I thought you could do it!

314
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,610
I'm sorry!

315
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,720
This is scary, as always...

316
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:16,740
Your head and sense of taste are both dulled!

317
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,210
That's enough, Endou.

318
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,950
Stand up!

319
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,560
Wait a minute!

320
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,910
Give me the chips in it! I'm last and I'll make it with the chips!

321
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,830
You'll have the same conditions as everyone else!

322
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,370
Endou did it too -

323
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,250
PUT THE CHIPS IN!!!

324
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,620
WHAT'S WRONG WITH PUTTING THE CHIPS IN?

325
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,810
CHIP! CHIP!

326
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,270
PUT THE CHIPS IN IT!!

327
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,660
Shut your mouth already!

328
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,150
Extra challenging Kiki Chili Oil.

329
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:58,470
The item is same as Hamada's, Kaburaya's ""Daruma Chili Oil".

330
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,960
I'm gonna go with two-finger, alright?

331
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,080
This two-finger style's... this...

332
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,420
That thing you're doing is the same as Endou!

333
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,720
This has more flavor than I expected!

334
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,250
The garlic really stands out.

335
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,420
Next I'll try the chips...

336
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,000
Strange... No chips?

337
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,230
There aren't any chips!

338
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,600
CHIP! CHIP!

339
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,870
I'll start from this end!

340
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,260
So I can't change after taking this?

341
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,100
That's against rules.

342
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,140
Just wait a moment.

343
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,350
I can tell it!

344
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,210
Completely different!

345
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,460
I get it!

346
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,510
I understand, however~!!

347
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,680
Nobody does that anymore!

348
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,500
Yassan imitations...

349
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,500
Yokoyama Yasushi, comedian. Partner of Nishikawa Kiyoshi.

350
00:18:54,530 --> 00:19:00,310
The oil I ate, Momoya's "Seems strong but isn't; Mildly Strong Chili Oil" WAS NOT IT!

351
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,490
I could totally tell this one!

352
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:05,790
I am different from you guys so far!

353
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,200
I can really recognize the differences by taste!

354
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,580
Matsumoto is full of confidence! True to his words, he clears four more with a breeze!

355
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,620
I totally get this!

356
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,690
Here I go!

357
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,160
Close!

358
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,670
So here it comes...

359
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,400
Who picked this?

360
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,900
Who picked this one?

361
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,260
Say it in rapid-talk! Who decided this one?

362
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,340
We did it together...

363
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,970
There's four of you, just who picked it? In rapid-speech.

364
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:57,110
Just who put most of their fe-feelingses in it?

365
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,190
Feelingses?

366
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,750
You're talking so fast you're not making any sense.

367
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,040
No, I'll trust my insticts here.

368
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:10,500
It was much closer than the previous one,
but this one's not gonna fool me.

369
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,780
The oil I ate...

370
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,680
Wakatake Chikui... Jikuchi's...

371
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:22,930
...Tsukiji no [Reclaimed Land] Chili Oil - Gyokaikei Garlic! "
WAS NOT IT! Best regards!

372
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,980
All right! I did it!

373
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,980
I overcame this one!

374
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:34,730
Which should I do next?
I guess I'll go in the order afterall.

375
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,900
I'll keep going with the two-finger style.

376
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:39,010
With two-finger...

377
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,120
It's here!

378
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:11,590
THIS IS IT! YOU GUYS!!

379
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:21,110
I'll believe in myself! This is definitely it!

380
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,700
Could I try this one just a little?

381
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,540
That's out of bounds!

382
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,850
Just this one!

383
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,850
That's against the rules.

384
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,030
I really wanted to try this one, too.

385
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,970
Also, nobody has tried this one!

386
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:42,750
There's a possibility you're messing with me,
but in that case it's hopeless.

387
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,620
I'll just lash out and go home.

388
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:53,450
I'm 90% sure I'm right with Daruma.

389
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,140
But still -

390
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,490
If it's within these three ones, I couldn't care less. Not my problem.

391
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,040
You can't do anything with those you didn't taste, after all.

392
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,030
ALRIGHT!!

393
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:14,320
Right now, my eyes totally met with that camera assistant.

394
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,220
That's fine, he's just doing his job.

395
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,760
SHALL I GO~!?

396
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:27,460
I'll get through here, since were always going around the other side.

397
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,050
How's that?

398
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,340
I'll go now.

399
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:36,440
This is it. This is definitely it! Look, here I go again!

400
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,770
Alright!

401
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,220
The oil I ate...

402
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,460
Kaburaya's "Hot Chili Oil...

403
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,090
...DARUMA CHILI OIL", WAS THIS!

404
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:03,080
Well done!

405
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,990
You really did it!

406
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,960
I guess all the studying paid off after all!

407
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,710
Studies?

408
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,710
My student days...

409
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,370
Wonderful! Congratulations!

410
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:37,840
It's really great you could do it with your sense of taste!

411
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,210
It's been a while!

412
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,190
Tomorrow, the phone at the office won't stop ringing!

413
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,820
"Who's that old guy?"

414
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,820
"Who's that old guy?"

415
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,490
"Who's that old guy..."

416
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:49,490
"Couldn't he join Waratte Iitomo! already?"
