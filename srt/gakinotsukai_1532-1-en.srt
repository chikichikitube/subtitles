1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,210
Matsumoto-san, what are we doing today?

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,990
To be honest, I know almost nothing about today's theme

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,490
Except the fact that Endo is on fire

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,060
-He's on fire?
-Yes, Endo is on fire

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,700
So we are sitting here because Endo is on fire?

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,060
He's even having an undercut hairstyle now

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,490
That's all I know

8
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:19,240
Tanaka

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:19,530
Yes

10
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:20,520
Is Endo on fire?

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,880
Yes, he is completely on fire

12
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,300
What are we supposed to do?

13
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,990
So for today, there's this VTR that we really want to show you all again

14
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,080
Oh, I see

15
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,250
Please take a look

16
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,720
Endo Shozo, 49 years old

17
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:43,420
The gag that he created in his 29 years of career

18
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,430
Ho-ho-hoi

19
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,660
It has been used in the CM of various large corporations

20
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:57,940
The nationally known gag that can be seen on TV everyday

21
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,940
No it's not

22
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,850
The gag that has been loved for over 20 years, Ho-ho-hoi

23
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,150
However, it was actually a repetition of success and failure

24
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:15,560
This is a true story of the trajectory between Endo and Ho-ho-hoi

25
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,680
Ah, I see where this is going

26
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,170
The birth of Ho-ho-hoi

27
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,290
Wow, it's Lytton Commission

28
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,400
He was so fast back then

29
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,030
-His Ho-ho-hoi is so fast
-Yeah, he was young

30
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,530
Oh, it's Korakuen Hall

31
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,810
The glory he deserves

32
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,400
-Ah, the one about Yama-chan
-Yes

33
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,790
It's Shin-oni

34
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:45,490
The collapse of confidence

35
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:55,060
Get everything back!

36
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:55,060
The pride of Ho-ho-hoi

37
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:04,570
Put everything in!

38
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:04,570
The endless love towards Ho-ho-hoi

39
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:08,890
Project Ho-ho-hoi

40
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,710
What the heck is he saying?

41
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,580
What the heck is this?

42
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:21,650
I thought maybe you guys are looking down upon Endo's national gag Ho-ho-hoi

43
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,160
Of course we are looking down upon it

44
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,290
What are you talking about?

45
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,430
How is it nationally known?

46
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,460
Yeah, seriously

47
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,460
If that is the case, then you guys are wrong

48
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:42,380
So today, we want to show you guys how amazing is Endo's national gag Ho-ho-hoi

49
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,380
Eh, so that is today's theme?

50
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:44,980
Yes

51
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,310
That's unbelievable

52
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,510
So let's welcome today's protagonist

53
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,150
Endo-san, please come in!

54
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,770
The face when he comes in is important

55
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,040
What kind of face will it be?

56
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,420
This is actually the main point

57
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,890
Ah, so that's the face

58
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,400
The face of Mori-san

59
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,300
Yeah, I see

60
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:14,840
Subbed by Appieopie, more episodes at
www.laughseejapan.com/user/18797

61
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,990
Please excuse me for this

62
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:20,450
Did you hear what we said before you came in?

63
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,250
Yes, I heard it

64
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,520
-I was being completely embarrassed
-No, no, no

65
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,120
We didn't embarrass you

66
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,200
We're just being honest

67
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,440
That's just how it is

68
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,240
No, no, no way

69
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,280
-It was indeed really popular right?
-Yes, of course

70
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,190
Although it's strange to say this myself

71
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,420
In fact, many kids even took video of themselves doing Ho-ho-hoi right?

72
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,010
Yeah, that's true

73
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,500
-Really?
-Yes

74
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,340
So is there a VTR of that?

75
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,470
Is there a VTR of that today?

76
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,710
Well, not for today

77
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:48,380
Come on, you need to prepare that

78
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,750
-Ho-ho-hoi is also very popular on SNS
-No way

79
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,750
So how was it created?

80
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,780
-Let's watch the story of it once again
-Seriously?

81
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,710
-Let's watch it
-That's so aggressive

82
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,960
-In 1971
-Starting from here?

83
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,060
Endo Shozo was born in Osaka Toyonaka-shi

84
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:13,600
This little boy's dream was to become a professional baseball player

85
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,680
Yeah

86
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,620
He didn't even thought
about becoming a comedian

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,900
He even studied at a high school in Shikoku to learn about baseball

88
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,940
Yet, he couldn't make it to the National
High School Baseball Championship

89
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:26,750
The next thing that Endo aimed for, was Owarai

90
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,240
In 1991

91
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,730
He invited Tanaka, his friend since primary school

92
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,040
That's during the
Coming of Age Day

93
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,090
And went to Tokyo to become a comedian

94
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,990
They were employed by Yoshimoto, and Cocorico was established

95
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,720
In the next year, 1992

96
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,430
They debut during the stage show Battermon Club

97
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,060
I remember that

98
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,030
Although they participated in the stage show

99
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,030
They didn't get much work from TV shows

100
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:54,640
And they were struggling as one of the many juniors in Tokyo

101
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,640
Tanaka was so skinny

102
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,970
Nevertheless, an opportunity knocked at Endo's door

103
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,240
Hey

104
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,370
Oh my god!!

105
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,350
Endo

106
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,230
We have been chosen to do the introduction for Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!

107
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,630
Really!?

108
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,170
We have been chosen to do the introduction for Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende?

109
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,320
No need to say it in full dude

110
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:26,610
Yes! We will be doing the introduction for that popular show Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!

111
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,780
It's like a dream to do the introduction for Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!

112
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,260
That's enough

113
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,560
No, it's not a dream

114
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,850
Let's do the introduction for Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!

115
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,330
Okay

116
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,160
This is where it all begins!

117
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,560
Everything starts here!!

118
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,800
Downtown was already one of the most famous comedian duo back then

119
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,140
Downtown was completely out of Endo's league

120
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,670
They are the admirable stars

121
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:01,050
They've been working really hard in the introduction, and then one day...

122
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,180
Matsumoto said something unexpected

123
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,520
By the way

124
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,600
For next week's theme

125
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,600
Matsumoto Hitoshi

126
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,650
Maybe Cocorico can join as well

127
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,860
Really?

128
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,260
Thank you so much!!

129
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:25,140
They received an exceptional promotion!

130
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,860
However, while they became the regular members

131
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,690
-I remember this
-Oh, really

132
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,710
I remember this

133
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,680
While Tanaka has successfully created many hilarious moments

134
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,680
Tanaka didn't
change at all

135
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,190
Contrarily, for Endo...

136
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,560
Ah, it's Shichi Henge

137
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,060
Is this Shichi Henge?

138
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,930
Yes, it's Shichi Henge

139
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,740
I'm Endo

140
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,420
I remember this

141
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,730
Oh, you remember this?

142
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,020
I'm Endo Shozo

143
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,020
I don't remember this

144
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,420
I don't remember this at all

145
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,080
That's the worst

146
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,230
That's truly the worst

147
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,490
I was so nervous at that time

148
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:16,960
Although he's giving a full effort, he still wasn't able to get a laugh

149
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,950
Tanaka was interesting at that time

150
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,440
Endo was struggling to find his own position

151
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,440
Yeah, he probably was

152
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,840
Hey, how are you doing?

153
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,340
Hello

154
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,060
Producer

155
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,790
What happened?

156
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,580
You look upset

157
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,930
He doesn't
look right

158
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:39,710
I'm unable to leave a legacy at all

159
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,410
He looks
much fatter

160
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:43,610
What am I lacking of, Suga-san?

161
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,530
Please tell me

162
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,550
Endo

163
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,550
Things will work out

164
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,320
Just try hard!!

165
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,870
He said things
will just work out

166
00:07:54,870 --> 00:08:01,000
While Endo was still struggling, an opportunity knocked at Endo's door

167
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,320
It was a theme of the show, which triggered the creation of that gag

168
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,910
And that theme was...

169
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:18,070
To compete with their senior duo Lytton Commission for various physical games

170
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:21,000
And one of the games that they played was...

171
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,390
High mood battle

172
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,840
No problem, Cocorico can be very high

173
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,640
Come on, do it Endo

174
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,820
Ah, it's shaping up

175
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,270
And he's so fast

176
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,500
Yeah, it's fast

177
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,570
That's so fast

178
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,510
This is how it was born

179
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,800
-This is the first time?
-Yes, this is how it's born

180
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,800
It's getting so much laughters

181
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,980
Endo

182
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,780
Interesting!!

183
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,870
Oh, good for you

184
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,770
I was so happy about this

185
00:08:52,780 --> 00:09:01,590
This was the first time that Endo felt successful as a comedian

186
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:06,320
Here starts Endo Shozo's strike back

187
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,470
Project Ho-ho-hoi

188
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:16,170
-That was where Ho-ho-hoi was born
-Yeah, I see

189
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,680
-This is a true story right?
-Yes

190
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,950
This is a true story

191
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:24,150
He was actually just forced to perform something at that time right?

192
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,440
Yes, it was improvised

193
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,580
-And Matsumoto-san said that it's interesting
-Yes, I did

194
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,820
So he thought this must be interesting and elaborated it further

195
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,250
Well, but I remember that

196
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:41,540
I had to say Endo is interesting because of how boring Lytton Commission was

197
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,090
I just thought I have to do something

198
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,700
In order to make the theme valid

199
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,030
But still, I was really happy that you said I'm interesting

200
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,410
Feeling like "he finally said that to me"

201
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:56,220
So this is how Ho-ho-hoi was born

202
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:01,310
And we will now watch how Endo transformed Ho-ho-hoi into a beautifully finished gag

203
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,420
-Eh, we need to watch that?
-Umm, that's enough

204
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,730
That's enough, that's seriously enough, Tanaka

205
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,790
This is embarrassing to him too

206
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,830
No, I want to watch this with you guys

207
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,970
-Seriously?
-Yes, together

208
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:20,570
During the High mood battle with Lytton Commission, Endo felt successful as a comedian for the first time

209
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:27,650
However, he was troubled about how to perform it in the show

210
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,920
Oh, Endo

211
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,920
It's him again

212
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,790
We'll be doing a battle like the one
with Lytton Commission for today's show

213
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,260
Please note that

214
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,260
A theme which is similar to that battle?

215
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,290
What could that be?

216
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,350
That theme was...

217
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:49,160
High mood
The best 10

218
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:57,480
A theme with juniors performing their high mood gags

219
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,260
The juniors who performed include

220
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,580
Gokuraku Tombo

221
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,950
Ameagari Kesshitai

222
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,040
Fujii Takashi

223
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,430
and a bunch of famous comedians

224
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,910
And the man who got the first place was...

225
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:16,100
Love ~Ho-ho-ho-ho-i~
Cocorico, Endo Shozo

226
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:26,330
Endo decided to put everything into this theme!

227
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,320
Seriously?

228
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:30,130
Do you know the rhythm of the Samba

229
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,500
So it's completed
at this time already

230
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,510
Do you know the rhythm of the Samba

231
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,040
Ho-ho-hoi

232
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,220
Do you know the rhythm of the Samba

233
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:40,980
Ho-ho-hoi

234
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:40,980
The movement was
incredible at that time

235
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:46,200
It's a lot more lively

236
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,790
That's really good

237
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,540
Yeah, it's completely different

238
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,250
He's moving a lot

239
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,920
He really is moving a lot

240
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,130
And it was
getting a laugh

241
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,900
Thank you very much

242
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,070
This is amazing

243
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:04,010
The studio was full of laughter

244
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,290
That was the first time

245
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,200
For the first time?

246
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:11,350
Endo's confidence has been reassured

247
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:17,790
This "High mood the best 10" theme has paved the way for Endo to start his strike back

248
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,200
Three months after "High mood the best 10"

249
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,100
During the theme "Yamazaki vs Moriman in Korakuen hall"

250
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,020
Let's do this again Yama-chan

251
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,270
-No way
-Let's do Moriman battle again

252
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,820
Before the battle starts

253
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:43,280
Let's watch the "Endo Opera" by Endo Shozo

254
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,330
The audiences are screaming

255
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,660
-He's so popular
-That was amazing

256
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,890
They are screaming like "GYAAA"

257
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,960
Do you know the rhythm of Samba?

258
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,960
He's moving a lot

259
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:04,100
He's on fire

260
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,890
He's improvising a lot

261
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,890
Yes, he is

262
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:23,360
Furthermore, during the "Kouhaku High mood battle" at the end of the same year

263
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,100
Using the big Japanese drum as the background music

264
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,100
Endo has been the key performer with Ho-ho-hoi

265
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,430
What the heck is a key performer with Ho-ho-hoi

266
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,380
I was moving a lot,
it's like 22 years ago

267
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:50,080
Endo got a laugh from the audience again and again with Ho-ho-hoi

268
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:57,620
This is the moment when he grasped the Ho-ho-hoi dream

269
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,620
What the heck?

270
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,250
Furthermore, for his private life, he was married as well

271
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:08,590
Endo has gained everything,
both the status and reputation as a comedian

272
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:13,060
However, this was just the start of an unforeseen misery

273
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,060
Ah, yeah it is

274
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,870
Project Ho-ho-hoi

275
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,670
-We all know about this
-Yeah

276
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,940
We all know about this already

277
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,160
What makes us concerned is that

278
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,800
While the gag is beautifully finished

279
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,120
And everything seems to be smooth sailing

280
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,890
However, it then talked about Endo's misery at the end

281
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,660
Yeah, we all know what happened

282
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,270
A lot of things had happened

283
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,340
Everyone knows about this

284
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,490
What happened to Endo who was smooth sailing

285
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,390
No, no, no

286
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:41,230
Let's take a look

287
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,930
What the heck is this?

288
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:52,310
With the nationally known gag Ho-ho-hoi,
Endo has entered his peak period

289
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,160
I remember this clearly

290
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,290
I remember this

291
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,420
What happened?

292
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,610
What's happening?

293
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,500
Was he carried away?

294
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,550
There's nothing for me to be afraid of now!!

295
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:20,260
I can always get a laugh with Ho-ho-hoi

296
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:27,370
However, Endo didn't even notice that things were slowly but surely changing

297
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,370
I see

298
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:34,480
I'm going to do the Ho-ho-hoi that everyone likes

299
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,340
Let's get started

300
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,760
Ho-ho-hoi

301
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,600
Hoi-hore-beep-beep

302
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,030
Ho-ho-hoi

303
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,890
Hoi-hore-tsu-te

304
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,180
His movement was
already so slow

305
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,560
Ho-ho-hoi wasn't able to get a laugh anymore

306
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,780
He then started
to use some items

307
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,870
Endo didn't want to accept the reality

308
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:57,140
And he started to use various Objet d'art to muddle through

309
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,360
Yes, he did

310
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,140
Yes, he did

311
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,920
I missed you so much

312
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,810
It's not the same
gag anymore

313
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,630
I missed you so much

314
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,350
He started to depend on other things

315
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,740
That's horrible!

316
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,740
That's just horrible

317
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,750
It didn't get a laugh

318
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:19,390
Excuse me

319
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,790
Endo-san

320
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,080
There's another work about Ho-ho-hoi

321
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,180
What do you think?

322
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,400
Ho-ho-hoi is enough

323
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,250
I can get along without Ho-ho-hoi anyway

324
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,250
He's being arrogant

325
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:51,490
Endo dumped Ho-ho-hoi

326
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,470
In addition, this even affected his private life

327
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:59,300
His wife, who has been with him for 5 years, left him too

328
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:06,110
Endo is going through his worst times, and yet, something even worse happened

329
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:11,420
That happened during the No-laughing Newspaper Agency

330
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:16,380
For the wedding press conference section

331
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:21,550
Let's welcome the bride who grabbed happiness

332
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,780
-Chiaki-san
-Yes

333
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,310
What is the key reason for you to choose your husband?

334
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:39,060
Because he is much more unique than my ex-husband

335
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,150
Can your husband do something interesting please?

336
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:49,190
Ho-ho-hoi

337
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,280
It was very shocking

338
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:01,240
The Ho-ho-hoi that Endo dumped was getting a laugh from the audience

339
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,260
He's depressed

340
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,810
Yes, he was

341
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:10,590
It was just an accident for that gag to get a laugh

342
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:17,240
It's awkward for me to get naked and do Ho-ho-hoi again anyway

343
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,710
I dumped that gag already

344
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,960
-He dumped it?
-Yes

345
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,580
Endo gave himself up, however...

346
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:32,990
The arise of a comedian has fired him up again

347
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:37,350
He's Shoji Tomoharu, an original character by Shinagawa Shoji

348
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:42,990
Endo was shocked by his performance during the High mood competition

349
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:48,480
There's a lot of Pa-pi-pu-pe-po

350
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,870
The horizontal Pa-pi-pu-pe-po

351
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:56,600
The vertical Pa-pi-pu-pe-po

352
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,670
This is good

353
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,720
Ah, this is really good

354
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,460
He's in a good mood

355
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,260
Thank you very much

356
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,540
I've been watching his performance back there

357
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:17,800
His movement and rhythm was very similar to what I did back in my younger days

358
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:25,300
Endo felt something similar when he witness Shoji's gag getting a laugh

359
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:30,850
This reminded him of the passion he once had in the old days

360
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,690
Endo decided to pick up Ho-ho-hoi once again

361
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,460
And an opportunity came to him again

362
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:43,230
That was during last year's Youth High School

363
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:48,600
When they met the superintendent Amami Yuki

364
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,700
Yeah, right

365
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,330
You're looking pretty relaxed there, Endo-kun

366
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,050
Yes?

367
00:19:55,050 --> 00:20:02,020
You have this thing where you put on a silly voice, slap your cheeks, get naked, and do a little dance, right?

368
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,740
Do that here, right now

369
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,250
Hurry up! Get naked and do it!

370
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,180
Okay, here I go

371
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:17,320
Do you know the rhythm of the samba?

372
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,570
Let's get excited for the new year, everyone!

373
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:25,140
Ho-ho-hoi

374
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,540
It got a laugh!

375
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,220
It was shining more than ever before

376
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,010
Ho-ho-hoi and Endo have shown their capability

377
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,010
Did it get a laugh?

378
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:35,230
And gave a sign of their strike back

379
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,750
Even more...

380
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,100
(I want to get back that agility in Ho-ho-hoi)

381
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,200
Commit to results

382
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,770
Rizap

383
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:56,700
It was used in the CM of various large corporations

384
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,460
Ho-ho-hoi has once again become a nationally known gag

385
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,580
And Endo will continue to shine from now on

386
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,320
Project Ho-ho-hoi

387
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:13,030
-So we now all understand the history of Ho-ho-hoi
-That's more than enough

388
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:18,600
Let's watch Endo's nationally known gag again together

389
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,800
Let's welcome him, Endo-san!

390
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,110
He's so fat now

391
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,520
So, Endo-san

392
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:51,890
Please show us the nationally known gag, Ho-ho-hoi!

393
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:58,560
Please show us the nationally known gag, Ho-ho-hoi!

394
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:07,410
Do you know the rhythm of the samba?

395
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,710
Ho-ho-hoi

396
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,650
I'll continue working hard

397
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:14,360
Ho-ho-hoi

398
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:24,120
OUCH!

399
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,190
-He sprained his leg
-I think this is for real

400
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:30,190
-Yeah, his leg is stiff
-What can I do for you?

401
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:30,970
Just look at it

402
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:33,580
Look over here

403
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,700
-Look at it
-It hurts

404
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,860
Ouch! It hurts!

405
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,910
This is for real right?

406
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,910
This is for real...HAHAHAA

407
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,960
Can you stand up?

408
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,630
-No, I can't
-He have to do it himself

409
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:51,350
It's not our fault at all

410
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:55,690
-What the heck, dude
-No way

411
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:58,000
What the heck is wrong with him?

412
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,690
Let's just leave!!

413
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:02,640
I have no idea what's going on here

414
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,440
What's wrong with you dude

415
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,670
You're wicked!

416
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,300
What's wrong with him?

417
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,350
What's wrong with him?

418
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,310
Did you tear a ligament?

419
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:19,070
Not at all, not about the ligament

420
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:22,940
You've completely torn the Owarai ligament though

421
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,350
He just sprained his leg right?

422
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,580
Yes, you're right

423
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,930
No big deal

424
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:31,080
It was sprained all of a sudden

425
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:35,820
So he's leaving like that

426
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,830
He's the one who wanted to do it

427
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,700
And now he's leaving like that

428
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,870
He's even blaming us
