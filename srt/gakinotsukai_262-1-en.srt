1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,770
So, today our master painter

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,250
Downtown: Matsumoto Hitoshi (master painter) - Hamada Masatoshi

3
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:03,200
Yes yes yes

4
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:03,900
Will be Matsumoto

5
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:04,570
Exactly

6
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:05,840
To put it simply...

7
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,340
We'll try to find out whether or not you're good at drawing pictures

8
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,340
That's the plan

9
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,040
So pretty much today

10
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,710
It's not like we're going to see who's more creative

11
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,950
All of us will try to draw the same theme

12
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,950
This week, they'll all draw with master painter Matsumoto
a certain theme decided together and compete together

13
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,680
Then Matsumoto will review each one of our works

14
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,350
And lets us know

15
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:19,680
Got it

16
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,650
Just like that

17
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,950
Well, what I'll be looking for is what you've got there

18
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,960
Are you looking for our @#&$% ?

19
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,160
I'm talking about your spirit

20
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,060
Ooohh

21
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,020
So it's not just the appearance

22
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,300
What do you mean?

23
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,760
It's the feelings! - That's it that's it!

24
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,130
I'm not saying this about his artistic skills

25
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,130
But I must say, he really does look good dressed like this

26
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,700
World Famous Heipo
Saito Toshihide

27
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,900
I didn't realize there was such a big artist in here

28
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:53,720

Okay, with that being said, our first topic

31
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,350
Look, if I were to choose

32
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,050
I would go with what I'm good at drawing

33
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,260
Right, you'd choose what you're good at, makes sense

34
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,290
How old are you again?

35
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,930
Oh, here comes, go for it Yamazaki

36
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,020
Yamazaki Housei

37
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,460
I really like DisneyLand a lot

38
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,460
So I'm choosing "Mickey Mouse"

39
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,720
Theme:
Mickey Mouse

40
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,600
I see

41
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,770
"Mickey Mouse"

42
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,770
I'm really good at drawing him

43
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:13,270
Got it

44
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,570
I think it'll make a real challenge

45
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,640
Ok everybody, let's draw Mickey Mouse

46
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:25,110
Currently Drawing

47
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,180
It's important that you draw pouring yourself into it

48
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:39,160
Currently Drawing

49
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,490
Would you like to see master painter's one first?

50
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,430
Yeah, sounds good     -      Good idea
Without any warning?

51
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,130
As a starter, I see

52
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,300
I see, so it gets curvy in this point

53
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,100
Most likely

54
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,180
At this point it's also a challenge of mental pictures

55
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:57,780
Let's see the others!

56
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,350
I want to see his work

57
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,750
You mean Hamada's?

58
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,220
Ok, let's take at look at his Mickey Mouse

59
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,860
It's completely messed up!

60
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,100
Children would run away if they saw this!

61
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,000
That's anything but Mickey

62
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:18,200
You

63
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,500
That's the theme you brought up

64
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,170
Yeah I've suggested it

65
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,170
You're in trouble if yours isn't the best one

66
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:22,970
Show us yours, please

67
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,340
I'm not saying I nailed it, but that's the idea

68
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,500
Whaaaat?!

69
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,740
You-- that--

70
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:30,100
What the hell is this?

71
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,050
What about this?   -   His ears...
- How many ears are in there?

72
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,780
Why does he have two pairs of ears?

73
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,700
I made a mistake

74
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,580
Should have been just two

75
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,820
His nose too

76
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,050
Your turn, Heipo

77
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,850
Why is everyone turning Mickey into this?

78
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,100
It's freaky!

79
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,360
It would be terrifying to play with your Mickeys

80
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,060
I'd like to choose the worst one if possible

81
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,100
Sure

82
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,600
And that would be yours

83
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,000
Why? What about Yamazaki's?

84
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,090
No no, yours is the worst

85
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,090
You can't even tell that's Mickey!

86
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,240
"Seahorse"

87
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,900
Writer
Takasu Mitsuyoshi

88
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,280
A seahorse huh...

89
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,250
Theme:
Seahorse

90
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,280
I must say, I really am a master painter

91
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,020
Is that so?

92
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,120
It sucks!   -    The hell is this?

93
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,120
No way

94
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,820
I'm sure the viewers would give their consent to this

95
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,290
Its proportions are weird

96
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,590
That's no good

97
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,300
This is how it turned out

98
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,900
I guess that's how the tail is supposed to roll

99
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,710
Let's just look at his, shall we?

100
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,710
We know he's the main star, let's just look at his

101
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,190
Come on

102
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,080
TERRIFYING!

103
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,080
You're a monster, aren't you?!

104
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,220
What is this? What is this?!

105
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,790
I-it's his face

106
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:55,960
WHAT?!

107
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,900
See? The eyes...

108
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,500
Hold on a second

109
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,500
This one should be its mouth

110
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,800
It also seems to be smiling

111
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
You're right, it's expressive

112
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,800
It can experience human emotions

113
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,250
Show us yours, Suzuki

114
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,250
I think I got its body structure a bit wrong

115
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,720
Writer
Suzuki Masaki

116
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,250
What?!

117
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,720
Scary!

118
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,720
What the heck, it looks like a katana

119
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,880
For now, just tell us which one is the worst

120
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,250
About the worst one...

121
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,150
Maybe it's Heipo's

122
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,860
Or maybe Suzuki's

123
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,760
This game is harsh

124
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,290
Yours were pretty bad

125
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,160
But this!

126
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,970
This is something serious!

127
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,030
And it's also scary

128
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,830
I think I'm starting to like it a bit

129
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,920
Director
Yanaoka Hidekazu

130
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,940
Let's go with a character

131
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,120
Elvis Presley

132
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,580
Theme:
Elvis Presley

133
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,840
So

134
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,110
This is the master painter's work

135
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,080
Presley, isn't it?

136
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,410
Yes

137
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,220
It's good!   -   Cool

138
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:56,980
I know, right?

139
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,790
To be fair I've just drawn his face

140
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,720
This is...

141
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,590
How is this supposed to be Elvis Presley?

142
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,930
What's with this hairstyle?

143
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,600
I thought that's how--

144
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,530
It's nothing like that

145
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,300
You can tell the one you've drawn is japanese

146
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,130
You're right

147
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,760
Director
Sakamoto Hidenao

148
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,070
I wonder who this is

149
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,280
Heipo

150
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,680
You suck!

151
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,400
We can agree this is the worst

152
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,200
Yeah it's really bad

153
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,750
Why did he draw him with glasses?

154
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,260
Picture them as sunglasses

155
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,860
They make it look so lame

156
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,390
I think it's about time for our idiot-master painter

157
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,860
So japanese!

158
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,570
Are you for real?

159
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,340
Why, what's wrong with it?

160
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,100
It's terrible

161
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,810
I've even drawn his chest hair!

162
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,150
To be fair the worst one

163
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,450
Is this

164
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,600
You couldn't even get the hairstyle right

165
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,480
Producer
Kenji Suga

166
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,750
I know it will be a self-portrait for Hama-chan

167
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,730
But I'm choosing "Hama-chan's face"

168
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,800
Theme:
Hama-chan

169
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:13,720
Alright

170
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,430
Show us your work, master

171
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,090
Sure

172
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,240
It kinda

173
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,240
Looks like a dumb ogre

174
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,370
But I guess you can tell it's him   -   Yeah...

175
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,990
Director
Tsutsumimoto Yukio

176
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,010
So sweet!

177
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:35,350
Looks like the guy who will take the thing you accidentally dropped before to you house

178
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,350
Ok, Suga-chan

179
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,700
I made it a bit chubby

180
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,950
It seems to lack style

181
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,950
He's saying "nandeyanen"!

182
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,950
He clearly wrote it

183
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,700
My version is...

184
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,700
I think it's ok this way

185
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,400
I guess I can see you in this

186
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,400
Well I'm drawing myself after all

187
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,030
Duh

188
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,970
Giving that Hama-chan just came out as a theme

189
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,970
I was thinking of having Macchan as our last one

190
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:09,600
Theme:
Macchan

191
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,370
This one's hard

192
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,080
Scary!

193
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,080
It's an old man!

194
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,650
Really

195
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,650
I think I've nailed it

196
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,650
They eyes are spot on    - They are, right?

197
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,090
Yamazaki?  - It was hard

198
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,420
What a goofball

199
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,960
A generic goofball

200
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,630
So sweet

201
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,630
Looks like a reliable guy

202
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,080
I don't see much difference from his previous one

203
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,080
They're all good guys

204
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,080
He really do have the face of a nice guy

205
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,380
He's the type of guy I'd ask to take care of my chickens during Summer break

206
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,810
Ok, it's time for our idiot-master painter

207
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,110
Well, I think mine's the most resembling

208
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:47,720
Yeah?

209
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,990
Well it's a bit...

210
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,990
Yeah but you can tell that's him

211
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,890
Why don't you line up all your works here?

212
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,470
Why do we have to do this?

213
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,670
Why do I have to be the focused one?

214
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,370
Alright

215
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,940
Now we have gathered the entire collection of the idiot-master painter

216
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:17,700
Idiot Master Painter
Hamada's Collection

217
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,110
Are we having this corner for real?!

218
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:24,180
He was having a tough time when he drew this

219
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,850
You can sense it   -   I guess so

220
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,850
I know we would have got to this eventually

221
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,450
Since we were halfway through it

222
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,690
Let's send those as presents too

223
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,690
I mean, the idiot master painter's works

224
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,450
We'll have a lottery between those who want to get
Hama-chan & Macchan's illustration and send them!!

225
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,900
We could send them as presents to the viewers at home

226
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,090
Read more details at the end of the episode.

227
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,130
We could sign them

228
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,130
And send them as presents to our audience

229
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:55,730

230
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,860
Oh, that's nice

231
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,770
Oh, right, th-- for those

232
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,840
Who have just turned on the TV

233
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,840
That's not a panda

234
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,840
That's Mickey Mouse

235
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,840
I think it's important to make it clear
