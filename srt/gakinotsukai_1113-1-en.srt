Huh?

12
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,820
Matsumoto and Hamada aren't here..

13
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,820
That's true

14
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,490
Have you seen them?

15
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,860
No we haven't seen them either

16
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,930
Gooood morning

17
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:16,930
Good morning

18
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:17,860
Good morning!

19
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,730
Good morning, indeed

20
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,900
It's the rainy season

21
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,830
The rainy seasons are here again this year

22
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,570
The rainy seasons are here again this year

23
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,570
Downtown

24
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,570
Matsumoto Hitoshi

25
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,240
However

26
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,570
We always seem to expect a lot of rain

27
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,310
But in some years weirdly,

28
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,310
we get years where we barely get any rain, so I've heard

29
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,980
Oh, really?

30
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,650
I've heard that too

31
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:36,950
So...

32
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,250
LET'S GO

33
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,190
Hamada isn't here today

34
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,490
No, he isn't

35
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,060
Hamada's trying to gather everyone..

36
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,260
Hamada-san is?

37
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,100
Kazuhiro Fujiwara

39
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,100
Takafumi Inomoto

40
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,130
So...

41
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,100
...to keep it short...

42
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,000
He wants to win fights only with 'Nanyanen'

43
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,200
He wants to win fights only with 'Nanyanen'

44
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,470
I'm not quite sure what you mean...

45
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,470
Only words?

46
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:06,540
For example, during the times of late night music programs

47
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,480
late night music programs...

48
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,110
I see

49
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,110
you don't feel like losing

50
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,880
Using only "Nanyanen"

51
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,880
He wants to overwhelm his opponents using only that line

52
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,650
When he told this to me

53
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,760
He seemed very adamant about it

54
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,760
I'm not sure about that

55
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,890
Is there a purpose to all this?

56
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,830
Is he here today?

57
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,490
Yes, he is

58
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:27,560
He has descended upon us

59
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,000
descended?

60
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,630
Yes, he has

61
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,970
I guess we should head there then

62
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,700
Yes

63
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,540
Please

64
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,070
"I haven't taken in any carbs"

65
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,070
is what he said

66
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,070
I don't think that's related to what he's doing

67
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:44,850
Overwhelm the competition using a single phrase

68
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:44,850
Testing his greatest asset to fight them

69
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:41,980
Using only the single phrase "Nanyanen" to combat his opponents

70
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,850
testing the true potential of his abilities

71
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:50,150

83
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,030
He might be a bit nervous

84
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,730
He might be a bit nervous

85
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,700
In this challenge, there are only two outcomes so

86
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,300
There's a lot on the line

87
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,540
Go in with a warm smile

88
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,540
and say "Good Morning" to him

89
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,010
Yes

90
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,010
Alright, let's go

91
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,010
Good morning

92
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,850
Good morning

93
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,750
Good morning

94
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,750
Good morning!

95
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,420
Downtown

96
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,420
Hamada Masatoshi

97
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,750
Good morning!

98
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,360
So you heard?

99
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,420
Yes

100
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,760
We did hear about it but...

101
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,360
to be honest, we don't quite understand

102
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,900
Well, it's not that there's difficulty understanding

103
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,730
but it's really just what it is

104
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,600
"Nanyanen" for me...

105
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,500
Back in our more prime years

106
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,500
losing was never an option

107
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:45,040
In our most prime years

108
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,040
that is

109
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,980
So...

110
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,720
What's wrong Hamada-san?

111
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,550
He's charged

112
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,390
He's very charged right now

113
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,360
The challenge only allows

114
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,360
for the saying "nanyanen"

115
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,790
He must be very charged

116
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,390
When Hamada is wearing chino pants he's usually this charged

117
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,630
When Hamada is wearing chino pants he's usually this charged

118
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,260
What?

119
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,200
...and he's wearing chinos

120
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,870
He does seem very pent-up

121
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,200
So I think...

122
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,340
his opponents are probably

123
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:13,700
ready for him at the studio

124
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,340
ready for him at the studio

125
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,880
So we already have the opponents ready?

126
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,840
Yes, they're in the studio on stand-by

127
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,810
Some are also around the same age as him

128
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,910
Wow, amazing!

129
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,050
This has to be a pretty big group

130
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:26,990
This studio's big, too

131
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,550
This is exciting

132
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,520
Oh, there are the opponents in the same age as Hamada

133
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,120
50 people are in the studio as his opponents

134
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,490
50 people are in the studio as his opponents

135
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:42,670
50 People varying from ages 20~80 are on standby as opponents

136
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:51,980
Rules

137
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:51,980
m 0 0 l 0 15.5 l 18.625 15.5 l 18.625 0

138
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:51,980
m 0 0 l 0 15.5 l 18.625 15.5 l 18.625 0

139
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:52,210
m 0 0 l 0 15.5 l 18.625 15.5 l 18.625 0

140
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,060
Basically,

141
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,200
We have people of varying types

142
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,400
Men and women?

143
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,430
Yes both genders

144
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,740
All sorts of people

145
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:52,210
Hamada must go against the group in a verbal battle using only "nandeyanen"

146
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,570
Varying in occupations, ages and backgrounds

147
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,380
and Hamada using only "Nandeyanen" to defeat all of them

148
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,510
Only "Nandeyanen"

149
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,380
Alright let's go!

150
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,380
We have to watch closely

151
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,010
So many people

152
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,020
There is

153
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,720
They're all looking at us

154
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,330
Just staring

155
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,590
Such intense stares

156
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,830
I'll take anyone

157
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,100
All age groups are represented

158
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,640
Even elders

159
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,810
This guy looks like he can put up a fight but...

160
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,680
This guy looks like he can put up a fight but...

161
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,420
Nanyanen?

162
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,420
Huh?

163
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,890
Nanyanen?

164
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:58,280
Supermarket Worker (Age 37)

165
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,900
Nanyanen?

166
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,400
Nanyanen?

167
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,400
Nanyanen?

168
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,670
Nanyanen?

169
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:54,670
Nanyanen?

170
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,540
Huh? Nanyanen?

171
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,310
Nanyanen?

172
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,310
Nanyanen?

173
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,310
Nanyanen?

174
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,310
Nanyanen?

175
00:04:59,310 --> 00:04:59,740
Nanyanen?

176
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,110
Nanyanen?

177
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:00,710
Nanyanen?

178
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,680
Nanyanen?

179
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,350
Nanyanen?

180
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,090
Nani?

181
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,730
Nanya?

182
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,730
Nanyanen?

183
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,560
Nanyanen?

184
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,560
ALL RIGHT

185
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:25,400
HAMADA WINS

186
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:25,400
HAMADA WINS

187
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:22,800
Okay

188
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:23,930
What happened?

189
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:24,900
What happened?

190
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,970
I'm not sure what just occurred

191
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,840
He fainted

192
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,310
He's down

193
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,440
How did he go down?

194
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,110
Well he's already out

195
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,580
Well he's already out

196
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,480
The power

197
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,920
had a "flash down"

198
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:38,680
Just consuming him

199
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,590
His head just went blank

200
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,390
That took a little too long...

201
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,890
For my first, I thought I'd do better

202
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,160
So that's what it's like

203
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,360
So yeah

204
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,360
I'd like to go faster next time

205
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,360
It just seemed so quick already though

206
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,370
But he was young

207
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:59,900
I guess the young ones can fight

208
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,420
Being 37 and all

209
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,750
I can probably go faster with the older ones...

210
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,720
That's true

211
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,990
I think I can do better

212
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:25,600
I've seen this baldy before

213
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,030
Who?

214
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,740
Nanyanen?

215
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,240
What do you want?

216
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:48,620
Apartment Landlord (Age 79)

217
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,340
Huh?

218
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,340
What's so funny?

219
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,950
Punk

220
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,580
Nanyanen?

221
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,250
What the hell do you mean nanyanen?

222
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,250
Nanyanen?

223
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,050
Nanyanen?

224
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,560
What do you want from me?

225
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,360
Nanyanen?

226
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,530
Nanyanen?

227
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,530
What's so nanyanen?

228
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:57,560
Kid

229
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,900
Little brat

230
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,400
Hey

231
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,840
Huh?

232
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,870
Nanyanen?

233
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,040
I'll beat you little punk

234
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,640
Huh?

235
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,840
NANYANEEEN

236
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,310
ALL RIGHT

237
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,680
HAMADA WINS

238
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,680
HAMADA WINS

239
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:19,850
I'll beat you little punk

240
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,990
NANYANEEEN

241
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,260
Wow

242
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,260
That was pretty brutal

243
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,260
Very powerful

244
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,060
I should've ended that a little sooner

245
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,530
I should've ended that a little sooner

246
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Was it that dangerous?

247
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,840
It seemed very brutal

248
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,310
It was pretty strong

249
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,410
His tongue was out

250
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,040
That's a bad sign

251
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,610
Dangerous

252
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,310
He was looking for a beating

253
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,850
He did

254
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,080
He was really

255
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,080
trying to get him to break the rules

256
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,880
but he had just enough restraint

257
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,950
To stick with his one phrase

258
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,690
That was some solid defense by Hamada

259
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:58,560
That was some solid defense by Hamada

260
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,390
Very restrained

261
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,460
So it takes some time?

262
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,460
Should I go faster?

263
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,060
Well I don't think time is too big of an issue

264
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,960
If possible

265
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,700
We also have to consider

266
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,700
not taking up too much air time

267
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,900
So we should try going faster?

268
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,770
Perhaps

269
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:16,370
I guess I can see which ones I can take out quickly

270
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,050
He might be

271
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,150
silent

272
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,390
There's a nervous tension

273
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,320
He's got the height

274
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,390
He's got the height on him

275
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,220
That's an advantage

276
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,260
He's pretty tall

277
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,760
Also pretty young

278
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,130
Nanyanen?

279
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,030
Nanyanen?

280
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:49,240
Restaurant Worker (Age 35)

281
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,030
What's this about?

282
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,300
Saying nothing but nanyanen?

283
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,700
Huh?

284
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,710
Nanyanen!

285
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,810
Eh?

286
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:50,810
What's the problem?

287
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,310
Nanyanen?

288
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,010
What is it?

289
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,080
DONE

290
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,010
HAMADA WINS

291
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,010
HAMADA WINS

292
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,880
That was very quick

293
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,280
I didn't expect it to be so fast

294
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,390
Who?

295
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,820
Not even a chance

296
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,290
He's out of his level

297
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,460
Can you tell just by his looks?

298
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,560
That wasn't even fair

299
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,660
He seemed very nervous

300
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,630
I guess you can tell

301
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,830
Totally different league...

302
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,830
Oh, okay

303
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,470
Nanyanen?

304
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:32,080
Pastry Worker (Age 30)

305
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,770
30 is pretty young, I think

306
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,380
Nanyanen?

307
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,140
What is the matter?

308
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,880
Nanyanen?

309
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,880
What is it?

310
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,880
Nanyanen?

311
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,580
What is your problem, sir?

312
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,590
Nanyanen?

313
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,160
Whats the..

314
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,160
Nanyanen?

315
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,290
Nanyanen?

316
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,220
Nanyanen?

317
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,430
Nanya?

318
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,760
Nanyanen?

319
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,760
What

320
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,430
What's the..

321
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,430
Nanyanen?

322
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,460
OKAY

323
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:50,600
HAMADA WINS

324
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:50,600
HAMADA WINS

325
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,970
So quick!

326
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:49,970
That might've been a new record

327
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,970
His head is tilted

328
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,900
That was crazy

329
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,840
Well

330
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,370
He was a bit of an amateur

331
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,240
This wasn't that fair either

332
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,510
It almost felt bad kind of watching him

333
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,550
Since there are all sorts of people

334
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,880
Right

335
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,420
Special One-Shot Nanyanen Move

336
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,590
The Special One-Shot Move of "Nanyanen"

337
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,560
The pressure rises

338
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,560
as Hamada continues to defeat his opponents one by one

339

Auto Repairman (Age 60)

343
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,710
and against calloused auto repairmen

344
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,810
Six victories unchallenged

345
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,810
Now taking 6 wins unharmed and unchallenged

346
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:38,080
If you want me to take anyone on here

347
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,080
You can just tell me

348
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,450
Really?

349
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,050
Taking anyone here...

350
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,220
If I keep choosing my opponents

351
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,990
People might call me out for only choosing

352
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,990
the opponents that are "easy" to me

353
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,630
I don't mind you guys choosing at all

354
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,760
Just look around

355
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,160
Okay...

356
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,300
Seems like there are a lot of dads

357
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,900
Very stern looking people

358
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,530
Scary

359
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,670
Truly

360
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,240
That is certain

366
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,040
It's no problem

367
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,370
Are you sure?

368
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,110
I can definitely win this

369
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,680
Yeah

370
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,680
His expression is pretty intimidating

371
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,810
Him, right?

372
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,810
Yes

373
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,590

378
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,700

384
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,840

It's..over?

388
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,180
It's over?

389
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,180
Yeah

390
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,180
Was there a deciding blow?

391
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,490
He couldn't stand

392
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,790
His knees with his feet were..

393
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,790
So that can lose you the fight also

394
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,460
He was surprisingly weaker than we thought

395
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,460
Nanyanen?

396
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,460

In the heat of the match, the challenger slips down

401
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,870
The referee calls a win for Hamada

402
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:11,240
With the referee's call, Hamada is declared winner

403
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,980
That was a quick match

404
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,250
I didn't know technical wins were possible

405
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,650
Look at that person

406
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,780
Who?

407
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,050

Within seconds

423
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:46,110
It feels like he wasn't able to finish what he was saying...

424
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,610
He didn't really get to finish..

425
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:47,380
That was just him

426
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,710
His mouthpiece was coming out

427
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,780
Amazing

428
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,780
Everyone kinda looks different now

429
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,790
Was that okay?

430
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,290
Yeah, it's fine

486
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,190
Hold on, you guys

487
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,590
Saying stuff like "He's shaking"

488
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,430
Don't say that

489
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,970
That might not be the most well-mannered thing to say

490
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,700
I know it's your first time experiencing this...

491
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,500
but just remember

492
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,640
Don't try to add commentary on the situation of the opponent

493
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,240
Don't try to add commentary on the situation of the opponent

494
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,910
I'm sure you guys were aware of this

495
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,510
You could tell just by watching

496
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,510
Yeah

497
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:07,080
Let me take a break

498
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,550
That was pretty tiring

499
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,420
You said something too, right?

500
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,720
Yeah, I did

501
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:18,430
I need Matsumoto

502
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,430
to explain this better for you guys

503
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,600
That was...

504
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:19,600
Yes

505
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,000
We apologize

506
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,600
...Unacceptable

507
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,430
They're just trying to enjoy it

508
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,830
You can't do that

509
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,540
It's not all about

510
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,540
you guys enjoying the fights

511
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,570
That's not the purpose of all this

512
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:33,340
I knew he was shaking

513
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,610
And when I hear that from behind

514
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,610
I'm very sorry for that

515
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,050
This is our first time

516
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,350
We didn't completely understand the situation

517
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:42,550
DON'T TALK ABOUT THE SITUATION!!

518
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:42,590
DON'T TALK ABOUT THE SITUATION!!

519
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:42,620
DON'T TALK ABOUT THE SITUATION!!

520
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:42,650
DON'T TALK ABOUT THE SITUATION!!

521
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:42,690
DON'T TALK ABOUT THE SITUATION!!

522
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:42,720
DON'T TALK ABOUT THE SITUATION!!

523
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:42,750
DON'T TALK ABOUT THE SITUATION!!

524
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:42,790
DON'T TALK ABOUT THE SITUATION!!

525
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:42,820
DON'T TALK ABOUT THE SITUATION!!

526
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:42,850
DON'T TALK ABOUT THE SITUATION!!

527
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:47,660
DON'T TALK ABOUT THE SITUATION!!

528
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,930
I truly apologize

529
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,500
That's the last thing you want to do

530
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,730
I'm sorry

531
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,260
Please, give us one more chance

532
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,170
Alright then let's go

533
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,430
Alright then let's go

534
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,500
Thank you so much

535
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,000
This is a big deal

536
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,840
Up Next

537
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:06,840
He's using his talent to fight right now

538
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:06,840
New Star Appears!

539
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:07,780
Something about the way he's sitting

540
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,150
Something about the way he's sitting

541
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,350
Sitting next to the lady, the man over there

542
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:15,680
Sitting next to the lady, the man over there

543
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,890
Just something about him

544
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,460
Should we go?

545
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,160
Is that okay?

546
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,390
So just him?

547
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,790
I'm not really sure why he's sitting like that

548
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,100
So the guy just a little tilted

549
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,230
Could they just be a couple?

550
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,370
These two?

551
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,140
Just the way they're sitting seems a little off

552
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,540
I wonder why they're sitting at a place like this

553
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,670
Maybe to...

554
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,640
...catch his attention maybe

555
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,180
It's happening

556
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:44,050

Nanyanen?

563
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,890
Huh?

564
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,200

566
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,260

Wow. That was very intense.

574
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,780
Is she coming for revenge?

576
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,580

578
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,690

Wait. That's it?

582
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,390
All she said was "huh"

583
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,930
So they were a couple

584
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,030
Definitely

585
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:33,900
That was a lot

586
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,500
They were most likely very experienced

587
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,470
Those elderly people there...

588
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:40,500
Those elderly people there...

589
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,500
They might not be in your same age group but...

590
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,510
The man in the white hair

591
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,680
He could be a real veteran in the game

592
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,380
He could be one of the oldest people here

593
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,350
Family:

594
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,350

597
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,610
Probably the oldest

598
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,620
I see, people like this

599
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,250
He could be very strong

600
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,320
It's possible that he's actually very strong

601
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,890
It's possible that he's actually very strong

602
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,990
True

603
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,990
who?

604
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:08,330
He seems strong

605
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,200
This could be a tough match

606
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,030
He's got his hand out

607
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:22,010
He seems to be ready

608
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,950
There seems to be an aura around him

609
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,920
Just something about him

610
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,920
Yeah

611
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:38,130

Alright

616
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,040

617
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,040
Who won?

618
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,770
I'm not sure who won

619
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,580
It was a little hard to follow

620
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,980
That must have been hard to understand

621
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,310
His eyes are still..

622
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,310
Alright

623
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,280
Okay

624
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,680
He hasn't fallen over

625
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,680
Alright

626
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,050
I don't think he fell over

627
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:04,090
He's just..

628
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,320
He hasn't fallen over

629
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,320
He's still awake

630
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,220
Huh?

631
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,990
You're really excited, Hamada-san

632
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,170
When there are matches like these

633
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,370
It's scary

634
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:18,930
That was really scary

635
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,440
It gets difficult sometimes

636
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,670
It's probably just a mulligan

637
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:37,120
Unemployed (Age 82)

638
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,340

He's down

647
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,530
He's down

648
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,400
Is he really down this time?

649
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,700
Well..

650
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,610
This guy's a little different...

651
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,570
This guy's a little different...

652
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,680
His fighting style...

653
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,280
...Could just be different yes

654
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,750
Very different style

655
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:07,080
Maybe he's out from a different discipline

656
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,520
There were probably people from different events

657
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,920
There's also another guy in the same age group as me

658
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,350
There's also another guy in the same age group as me

659
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:12,620
Really?

660
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,760
Well if you really want to do this

661
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,860
then...

662
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,160
Try it out, Tanaka-san

663
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,600
Are you sure?

664
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,600
I..I'm not sure

665
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,670
We've never tried this

666
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,670
I have never done this in my life either

667
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:27,300
The man over there looks as ready as he can be

668
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,600
Yeah

669
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,310

He's older than your father, Tanaka

675
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,310
Yes, that's true

676
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,610
Alright

677
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:49,560

He lost?

684
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,830
He flinched

685
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,770
He did jump back

686
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,600
You're so weak!

687
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,800
That was only one exchange

688
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,810
A very quick fight

689
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,970
Okay, sorry

690
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,380
Oh, he's back

691
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:06,940
How was it?

692
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,940
Do you remember losing?

693
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,410
You lost your memory?

694
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,510
Yes, I did

695
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,350
You really flinched

696
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,250
Nanyanen?

697
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,020
What!?

698
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,550
Flinch

699
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:27,930
A sucker punch from Plasterer Sato warps

700
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:27,930
A sucker punch from Plasterer Sato warps

701
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:27,930
Tanaka into a knockout

702
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:27,930
Tanaka into a knockout

703
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,500
Plasterer Sato sucker punches Tanaka back

704
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,730
into a knockout

705
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,930
I'm sorry about that

706
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,840
Why is he still up when I already took him out

707
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,110
Why is he still up when I already took him out

708
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,910
He's got a

709
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,210
high sense of freedom

710
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:44,650
He might not go down

711
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:44,650
Until you completely beat him

712
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,220
That's tough

713
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:48,980
Why did you say "that's tough"

714
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:48,980
when you're so close to the opponent?

715
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,250
Well..you know...

716
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,260
There are some parts I haven't taken care of yet...

717
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,430
Let's try it

718
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,430
I thought I'd beaten him by now

719
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,030
That's true

720
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,270
Yeah

721
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,170
Nanya?

722
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,440
That's tough

723
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:14,080
Why did you say "that's tough"

724
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:14,080
when you're so close to the opponent?

725
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,750
Well..you know...

726
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,450
There are some parts I haven't taken care of yet...

727
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,750
Wow

728
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,850
Let's try it

729
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,720
I thought I'd beaten him by now

730
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,460
He's really putting up a fight

731
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,260
Yeah

734
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,760
What is it?

735
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:44,070
So strong

736
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,240
How could he be this strong?

737
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,240
He's been taking quite the hits

738
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:50,810
Nanyanen?

739
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,320
How can I help you

740
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,350
He's an old master, an old master

741
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:57,320
He's an old master, an old master

742
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:00,520
An old master can truly put up a fight

743
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,520
What do you want?

744
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,290
UNEMPLOYED TAKEI WINS

745
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,290
UNEMPLOYED TAKEI WINS

746
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,690
Hamada-san!?

747
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,690
What!?

748
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,690
Oh no!

749
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,690
Hamada-san!?

750
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,030
EH!?

751
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,030
What happened!?

752
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,700
What about Hamada-san!?

753
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,170
Eh!?

754
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,170
This is too much

755
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,270
Amazing!

756
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,270
What just happened!?

757
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:20,480
It's scary because these things can happen

758
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,480
Really

759
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,950
Events like these CAN happen

760
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,420
Even he can't really tell if he's won or lost

761
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,480
Even he can't really tell if he's won or lost

762
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:31,320
This must mean that he knows what true power is

763
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,390
He didn't even intend to win

764
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:35,620
He didn't even intend to win

765
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,430
I didn't mean to hehehe

766
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:36,530
I didn't mean to hehehe

767
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:36,630
I didn't mean to hehehe

768
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,260
I didn't mean to hehehe

769
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,160
I didn't mean to?

770
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,200
I didn't mean to...
