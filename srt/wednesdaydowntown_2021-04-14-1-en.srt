00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:06,140
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:10,380
Letâ€™s get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:13,580
Who's there?

4
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,830
It's Koyabu

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,730
The one with the good voice!

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:27,540
This time, I'm bringing the second part of a theory that was tested four years ago

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,240
It is, how to put it, a bold experiment

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,410
Please take a look

9
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,710
The 2nd Comparing sweet and harsh, the harsh will make people more desperate

10
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,520
What kind of theory is it?

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:51,270
Previously we did 'if you can hang a bar for one second longer than normal, you will be rewarded 5,000 yen'

12
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,010
With this sweet approach

13
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,430
A total of three people extended their records

14
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,630
The harsh was doing the hanging bar in the air, if they let go they'll automatically do a bungee jump

15
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,180
A harsh situation

16
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,380
As a result, not even one person beat their own record

17
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,640
Completely stunned by fear
-Because it was too scary

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,720
Forced to let go

19
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,020
The whole team fell beautifully

20
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,950
In a sense, it was a good experiment

21
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,600
The conclusion was that when you are under too much pressure, you won't perform as well as you normally would
-I see

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,960
Nice experiment!

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,060
This type of result disproves the perseverance theory

24
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,130
It's like a reflection of the current times.
-That's right

25
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,300
The corresponding data was obtained

26
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,870
What a great show

27
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,950
In summary, can the pressure of harshness be overcome

28
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,570
Will anyone extend their record?

29
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,760
Hold on a little longer

30
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,870
In addition, Showa, in retrospect, was a mess

31
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:49,410
Also, a new project will be started

32
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:11,970
The 2nd Comparing sweet and harsh, the harsh will make people more desperate

33
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,290
The participants in this validation are

34
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,870
Battle with Nature - Survival Camping

35
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,040
A fake program called these five people

36
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,870
Got a bunch of great people

37
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:30,800
I'm sure you've all heard that we're having a camping training session here

38
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,600
Actually, it's a fake show.
-Eh?

39
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,900
What's going on?
-What the hell is it?

40
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,440
What do you think this program is?

41
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,050
Progressing very fast

42
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,140
Looking at this collection of participants made me a bit concerned

43
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,240
There's Nishimura, there's Dancho, and a Mameshiba

44
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,080
It can only be that one, right?

45
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,750
With Mameshiba people in it

46
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,820
As soon as you said it was a fake show I immediately came to my senses

47
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,620
I've never seen Mameshiba on anything else

48
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,720
What are we doing in a place like this?

49
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:01,860
The other day, weren't you asked to do hanging bar?

50
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,260
Did it!

51
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,260
Eh
-Everyone?

52
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,700
The sweet part's done already

53
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,770
Did you hang?

54
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,640
Is it the one were we get paid?

55
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,110
If I don't get the money this month, I can't pay my water bill

56
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes, in fact, two days ago

57
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,670
The members were called out separately under the name of other fake projects

58
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,900
In advance, we measured the time of hanging the bar in general

59
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,930
I see

60
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,780
Then

61
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,990
How long?

62
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:35,690
If you exceed this record by one second, you'll be awarded 5,000 yen per second

63
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,930
Oh~~

64
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,600
Ooh

65
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,210
Jimmy

66
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,680
Money is thus used as the motivating factor

67
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,520
Jimmy

68
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,370
To measure the time for the sweet motivator

69
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,610
This really makes people happy

70
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,940
I can make more money this way than any commercial performance

71
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:56,230
In summary, the usual data and the "sweet" data measured on that day are shown in the graph

72
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,240
What's wrong with Nishimura-kun?

73
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,160
Three of the five extended their records

74
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,800
Thus, a nice reward, to some extent, has the effect of allowing people to hold on a bit longer

75
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,770
This time it was also confirmed

76
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,960
Please do a follow-up on that one

77
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,330
Follow-up?
-There is no bar here

78
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,970
This time it's the other way around. We are testing how a penalty affects people

79
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,040
How much will it change in relation to the previous record

80
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,770
Ah, i'm scared, what do you mean by punishment?

81
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,480
The punishment is the bungee jump over there

82
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,310
Wait wait wait
-There's a bridge!

83
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,310
From there?
-Jump down?

84
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,020
Bungee jumping?

85
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:35,170
Hanging bar in the air with a bungee cord attached to the body

86
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,150
That's enough, that's enough

87
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,770
Bungee is a NG for me

88
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,520
I said that on this program, right?

89
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,140
Yes, it was said

90
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,160
Said bungee is a NG

91
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,730
But you can also not fall

92
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,270
No. That's only if you can set a new record, right?

93
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,540
NG?
-NG

94
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,400
It's also an NG for me

95
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,740
I feel like the world is ending

96
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,450
Yes, in fact, three of the members consider a bungee NG

97
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,180
What is the difference between this and SAW?

98
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,920
The kind of psychotic killing method

99
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:11,940
So, we took the members, whose faces were full of disgust, and went to the bungee jumping platform

100
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,800
Wow wow wow wow

101
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,770
Scary!

102
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,070
Just need to exceed the last record, right?

103
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,190
They can go back if they stay for longer

104
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,960
This is too scary, right?

105
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,680
57m

106
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,250
In addition, this time it is not a vertical drop bungee jump

107
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,920
Instead, we chose the swinging style to increase the fear factor

108
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,710
Is there such a thing?

109
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,420
This is not bungee jumping anymore, right?

110
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,080
I definitely will not jump

111
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,890
Is that the thing?

112
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,190
That is the bar

113
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,190
So first of all, the first person

114
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,930
Nishimura
-Eh?

115
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,410
Tough to go first

116
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,460
I don't want to be the first one

117
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,870
The first time he almost broke the 1 minute mark

118
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,300
Nishimura, who failed to extend the record with the promise of a reward, comes to challenge first

119
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,080
By the way, the backpack carried during the previous test

120
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,140
The weight of the harness and helmet was the same as when bungee jumping

121
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,990
It's really strict!

122
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,550
Is it pulling me? Why are you pulling me?

123
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,980
To get the rope...

124
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,120
A little bit shaky

125
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,790
This is scary

126
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,590
So scary!

127
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,650
Gotta hang there!?

128
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,600
One minute and five seconds is quite long

129
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,430
It's going out

130
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,890
Your palms will sweat, right?

131
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,910
Scary!

132
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,210
And the wind!

133
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:42,810
The eagle over there seems to have foreseen your death

134
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,820
The eagle's waiting for Nishimura to go down

135
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,420
Generally, if there are people it won't come anywhere close

136
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,850
I'm going to be fed to it

137
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,460
Will Nishimura be able to overcome the pressure?

138
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:57,560
Can he exceed the previous record of one minute and five seconds?

139
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,590
Ready, start!

140
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,110
Now you'd complain about why you stayed up for so long the first time

141
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,870
It's not good if you fall like this.
-It's not good, right?

142
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,350
Scary!

143
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,450
Wow, so scary!

144
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,350
This is the same as hanging on the edge of a cliff

145
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,730
Back to front

146
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,190
No, this is terrifying

147
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,040
It's really scary. It's like a shot from a movie

148
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,050
Very scary

149
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,300
This is bad this is bad

150
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,830
Just hold on for one minute and five seconds

151
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,120
Go for it!

152
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,470
Wow scary

153
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,310
Half a minute

154
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,300
Don't look down

155
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,360
Be calm

156
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,240
Whoa, seriously!

157
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,610
Thirty seconds left. Come on, come on

158
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,280
Not good...

159
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,100
No way, right?

160
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,360
It's okay, it's okay

161
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,400
20 seconds left

162
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,590
Not good!

163
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,640
Go for it!

164
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:01,120
It's okay. It's okay.
-Not good!

165
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,460
15 seconds left

166
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,840
A very typical fall

167
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,920
That's awful!

168
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,010
This is the fall

169
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,660
Scary!

170
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,400
This is too unbearable

171
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,340
Scary!

172
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,010
Very, very scary!

173
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,310
It's like seeing the moment of a person's death

174
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:56,770
Nishimura, just ten seconds away, fell with regret

175
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,210
10 seconds is long

176
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,720
This is a big deal

177
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,650
Really?

178
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,660
The scariest bungee jump I've done so far

179
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,160
Wow, really? What's so scary about it?

180
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,430
First of all, not facing forward

181
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:13,600
Normally you're looking ahead when you fall

182
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,970
If you can't hold on and fall, it's really...

183
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,800
It's the same feeling as falling down because of an accident

184
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,540
It totally feels like the moment of death

185
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,660
So, the next to go to their death is

186
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,980
Morita

187
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:42,210
The survival time of Morita, whose record was extended by sixteen seconds because of the reward, is thirty-eight seconds

188
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,590
How?

189
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,670
No!

190
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,770
That guy is a bungee NG!

191
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,900
Please put your foot on the board

192
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,440
Give me a second, wait, I can't reach it

193
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,270
Give me a minute!

194
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,140
Give me a minute

195
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,640
Wait a little bit

196
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,150
I want to see Morita fall down!

197
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,140
What is he talking about?

198
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,250
Can you wait a little longer?

199
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,550
Can you let me go back first? Wait a second

200
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,850
This is very forceful

201
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,950
Same as the last time, when none of them could extend the record

202
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,240
Their entire bodies are filled with terror

203
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,830
So much so that Morita could not even reach the starting position

204
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,060
I guess so

205
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,350
Can't even stand up

206
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:31,110
The bungee NG people are faced with a lot of pressure

207
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,050
Let me wait a minute

208
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,520
Wait wait

209
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,050
Hurry up

210
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,860
As he couldn't make up his mind

211
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,120
He took 20 minutes to finally get ready

212
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,840
Not good enough

213
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,160
Go

214
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:53,360
Okay, here we go

215
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,770
It really took a lot of time

216
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:59,120
Can he or can he not overcome his fear and exceed the record of 38 seconds?

217
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:01,230
It should be okay. It's only 38 seconds

218
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,760
Prepare, Start!

219
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,050
It looks like he's about to fall

220
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,760
Morita
-You can do it!

221
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,120
Thirty-eight seconds

222
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,750
Not looking good

223
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,290
Survive!

224
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,140
Too nervous

225
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,570
Morita, you have to survive!

226
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:14,940
Ten seconds!

227
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,740
It's Kaiji!

228
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,110
Almost!

229
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,580
20 seconds to go

230
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,030
It's been 20 seconds

231
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,200
He can do it

232
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,330
More than usual

233
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,700
Twenty-five!

234
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,590
The fear is working

235
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,750
Yes, you can

236
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,680
Almost 30

237
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,440
30!

238
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,020
So close

239
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,920
Five seconds to go

240
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,610
This is accident footage

241
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,740
It is completely the expression before death

242
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,400
The picture is really clear

243
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,270
Well, he looks ok

244
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,530
What a pity!

245
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,810
Four seconds to go

246
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,240
Damn

247
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:20,670
Morita died with four seconds to spare

248
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,940
Goodbye Morita

249
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,350
The phrase "Goodbye, Morita" has found a new meaning

250
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,730
Can't let me fall, right? I said NG

251
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,160
What a pity, only four seconds away

252
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,960
My heart rate at that time was terrible, right?

253
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,070
Breathing was also bad

254
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,800
At that time it was really no longer possible

255
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,190
Even we could hear it

256
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,150
You can't broadcast this kind of expression on TV

257
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,950
This should be against the rules

258
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,550
Because I'm NG, really

259
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,420
You let me fall, how could you?

260
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,420
How to put it?

261
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:59,820
I feel the frustration of having been murdered by Wednesday Downtown

262
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,260
Its really heavy

263
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,630
There are really things in life that you can't do anything about, no matter what

264
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,590
Next up

265
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,930
Pretty good?

266
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,380
Because you can get paid

267
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:22,010
In light of a potential reward, Kaede held on for 9 more seconds

268
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,790
Is it doable?

269
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,820
You'd surely be scared

270
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,260
Already crying

271
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,600
Crying!

272
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,120
I want to go home

273
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,330
She's the last person who needs to do this kind of thing

274
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,160
After all, she's an idol

275
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,960
She's unlucky she became famous through this show

276
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,370
That's true

277
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:50,910
No, no, no, no

278
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,380
Stop giving Hamada close-ups!

279
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,310
Ethical Issues

280
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,520
Crying

281
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,450
How can someone who cries like that do it?

282
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,590
Morita is bad enough

283
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:07,920
Can she exceed the previous record?

284
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,930
Yes, you can!

285
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,450
Go, go, go!

286
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,180
Thirty seconds is still possible, right?

287
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,300
Start

288
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,650
Go for it!
-She can do it!

289
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:19,260
I want to cheer her on

290
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,380
Concentrating

291
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:23,070
7, 8

292
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,780
Nine.
Ah you counted wrong, Jimmy

293
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,410
Why do you need to rely on yourself to count
-There are timing boards over there

294
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,350
Why're you timing it yourself

295
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,760
Jimmy is pretty relaxed

296
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,300
Twenty seconds have passed.
-Twenty

297
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,650
Concentrating

298
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,350
Not bad, not bad

299
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,350
Go for it!

300
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,000
And no more crying.
-Amazing

301
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,190
Is it possible to pass?
-I'll be 30 soon

302
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,830
Thirty seconds. Hold on

303
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,440
Five seconds to go.
-Not good. A little shaky

304
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,320
Is she...

305
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,680
Great! Great!

306
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,120
This is really moving

307
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,640
Awesome!

308
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,890
She put her life on the line

309
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:02,130
Kaede finally managed to update her record in the face of fear

310
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,120
Great!

311
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,740
Finally, the first survivor

312
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,980
This list of participants is pretty impressive

313
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,290
Great!

314
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,280
Former participants

315
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,890
Impressive!

316
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,730
I really can't do high places

317
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:18,430
I even cry on the plane

318
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,940
She worked hard

319
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,100
Were you thinking "don't fall!" and stuff like that?

320
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,440
I was hanging there think "I don't want to die"

321
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:31,040
I feel like today is the most powerful day of my life

322
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,440
The type that is very strong under adversity

323
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,210
But Hamada isn't smiling at all
-A look of regret

324
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,780
No, no, no.
-Disappointment written all over your face

325
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,240
Next up

326
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,290
So short

327
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,360
Only hung for eight seconds originally?

328
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:54,060
Before the issue of rewards or punishments, Jimmy found hanging extremely difficult

329
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,370
I can't!

330
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,200
Yes, 20 seconds.
-Come on

331
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,670
Wait a sec!

332
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,340
Can he beat his own record of nineteen seconds?

333
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,360
Let me go

334
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,390
Prepare, Start!

335
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,650
You can do it

336
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:20,330
Go, go, go, Jimmy!

337
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,030
No!

338
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,190
No!

339
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,270
Only 8 seconds!

340
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,860
No!

341
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,950
No!

342
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,230
No!

343
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,770
He said "no"

344
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,170
Eight seconds

345
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,800
So fast

346
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,160
Scary!

347
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,360
You said "no", right?

348
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,260
Very, very scary

349
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,300
Terrible

350
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:03,070
Crying for this kind of thing is a first for me

351
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,370
Only eight seconds

352
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:06,840
Are you all right, Jimmy?

353
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:10,110
From the beginning, too much force was used

354
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,240
Couldn't even move

355
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,010
What he is saying, I don't understand at all

356
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,450
This is not a bungee jump
-It's even scarier than bungee jumping

357
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,520
Scarier than bungee jumping

358
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,850
It's like listening to some war story

359
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:27,290
So the final challenge is Dancho

360
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,820
Known for his great endurance

361
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,260
Especially in this program

362
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,030
He is the unbeatable candidate

363
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,340
Will he be able to surpass his own record of one minute and 29 seconds?

364
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,350
So long!

365
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,200
We start straight away

366
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:51,050
The expression is already very strange

367
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,980
Prepare, Start!

368
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,140
The face has become the same as Morita

369
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,190
A man of great perseverance

370
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,730
Not even 10 seconds yet

371
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,520
Saying only bad stuff

372
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,800
Go for it!

373
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,070
Its been a few seconds, Jimmy

374
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:16,170
Not even 20 seconds.
-How the hell is it below 20?

375
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,730
There's going to be a problem when it's over

376
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,090
Oh, its working

377
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,250
Reaching 30

378
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,420
Times three

379
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:25,720
That's a nasty way of putting it

380
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,250
This statement is not good

381
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,570
Times three something

382
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,170
Okay one minute one minute

383
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:35,930
Awesome

384
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,030
Passed the original one

385
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,490
30 seconds left

386
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,870
Great
-Not thinking anything

387
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,570
How do you feel now?
-Why are you asking him that?

388
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:47,970
So close

389
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,190
So close

390
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,400
His hands are shaking

391
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,950
He was so close

392
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,700
Jimmy!

393
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,920
I blame Jimmy, he said a lot of useless things

394
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,930
Of course it will turn out like this

395
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,960
Did you hear Jimmy's voice?

396
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,370
Super annoying

397
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:24,470
In summary
Only some can extend due to fear

398
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,550
Kaede is awesome!

399
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:32,150
Only Kaede succeeded

400
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,370
Don't want to see her fall either, right?

401
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,650
Sure enough, we hoped she wouldn't fall and would come back safely

402
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,940
Everyone is happy

403
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,480
He said something very important

404
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,530
"What the hell? Why didn't she fall down?" and so on

405
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:48,730
Everyone clapped when Kaede succeeded

406
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,570
Only one person kept his head down like this

407
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,070
When Morita fell, he smiled as if someone asked him

408
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:56,640
"Should we go out for a steak?"

409
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,040
He had a big meal.
-As if there was a plate of steak in front of you

410
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:06,480
I'd like to ask if everyone here was born in the Showa period

411
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,580
Yes

412
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,750
We all experienced the turbulent Showa era

413
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:16,330
Thinking back, there was a lot of unethical behavior

414
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,400
There are a lot of those things, right?

415
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,000
The TV world is the same way

416
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,860
The theory I bring is this:

417
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:28,100
Showa, in retrospect, was a mess

418
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,770
It's true.
-It was a mess

419
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:50,790
Showa, in retrospect, was a mess

420
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:55,200
Compared to today, the Showa era had a lax system

421
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,940
The most liberal of these was the regulation of smoking

422
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:04,680
It's true.
-Everyone smoked

423
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:05,900
At that time, smoking on the road and at stations was a common behavior

424
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,310
There were no non-smoking cars on the Shinkansen

425
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,980
It was also fine on the plane

426
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,660
And even in the hospital consultation room

427
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,420
There were also many doctors who smoked in front of their patients

428
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,320
In the diet, politicians were covered in a haze

429
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,760
Thinking about it now, it was a mess

430
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,070
In a recent survey, the smoking rate among men was at 27.8%

431
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:40,490
But in Showa 41, it was as high as 83.7%

432
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,940
That's true.
-Everybody smoked

433
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:47,030
So at the time of the morning rush, the platform was like this

434
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,920
Incidentally, our Downtown also

435
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,520
So young

436
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,910
In the past, when I had no job and no money

437
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,550
I wanted to be on TV so much, I wanted to be on TV!

438
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,860
Didn't even have a regular program

439
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,970
This is just a special case

440
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:11,640
Even in Heisei, you could still smoke and record talk shows in the studio

441
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:16,410
There were also other messy things about the Showa era

442
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,770
Traffic

443
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:26,640
The current Tokyo morning rail congestion rate is 163%

444
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:30,280
For the full complement of trams in the 1960s

445
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,560
Surprisingly, it was over 300%

446
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:40,890
Not only was the number of runs low, but preparation for the ride was also impossible

447
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:43,230
Thus, it was a hell of a commute

448
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:49,070
We asked Mr. Hanashima, a former employee of the National Railroad, about the situation

449
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,720
Looking back on it now it really was like hell

450
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,920
We were overwhelmed by too many people

451
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,950
Broken windows were also a common occurrence

452
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:02,130
Especially when shattered by elbows, there were casualties

453
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:06,330
Peak season, summer, was the worst

454
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:10,600
Some people collapsed because of the heat and pressure

455
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,290
Heatstroke

456
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,130
What's more

457
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,510
It may not even be imaginable now

458
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:19,680
Sometimes when people squeezed on, their shoes fell off

459
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,210
When leaving the platform, they realized their shoes were missing

460
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:26,320
Larger stations had a shoe rental service

461
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:29,420
Incidentally, it was not only the train that was like this

462
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,260
Through the window?

463
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,260
The roads were also a mess

464
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:36,230
Wearing a seat belt while driving was not a requirement

465
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,380
Driving a motorcycle without a helmet was also the norm

466
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,680
Also, driving etiquette was not taken seriously

467
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,480
The lane lines at that time were also undefined

468
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:52,050
Looking back on it now, Showa was incredible

469
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,210
There are also other things

470
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:59,930
The pesticide DDT, which has now been detected as a carcinogen and banned from use

471
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,190
Spraying wildly!

472
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,930
Was sprayed directly onto human skin

473
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:07,970
Absorb the vibrations of this machine by putting your hand on it to improve performance

474
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:11,130
Your character will improve with this machine

475
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,240
Absolutely fraudulent

476
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:16,740
If you sleep on the pillow, you will become a genius

477
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:25,060
Products that blatantly advertised outrageous features were published in famous magazines

478
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,380
I had the x-ray glasses

479
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,820
In retrospect it was quite a lawless zone

480
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,350
But even more excessive is

481
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:36,090
Privacy of celebrities

482
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:40,150
We heard from a journalist

483
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,330
It was common to simply reveal the address of a celebrity

484
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,360
In a lot of magazines

485
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,800
They were subtly included in there

486
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,540
And written next to the person's name

487
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:59,170
Yes, next to the name of Japanese celebrities at the time

488
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:04,240
The artist's real name and home address were clearly stated

489
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:10,280
In this all-star address book, published as a supplement to the magazine

490
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:16,190
A total of 1,857 celebrities' residences were revealed

491
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,190
What's more

492
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:23,720
The addresses were also thoughtfully organized into a map of the "streets where the stars live"

493
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,920
Also

494
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:31,010
They'd go through actresses' bins

495
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:34,380
The magazines would report on it

496
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,110
That's a crime

497
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:42,710
At that time, there were many reporters who went through the trash cans of celebrities to collect information

498
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:49,900
One magazine had a "Trash Hunt Series"

499
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:54,070
Which revealed a big starlet's cigarette butts

500
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,420
Toothbrushes and other household waste

501
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,120
In addition

502
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,600
From scripts for TV shows to things that can't be shown on TV

503
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:09,310
All kinds of garbage were posted like a house raid

504
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:15,500
Clearly, there was no privacy for celebrities at that time

505
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:17,470
What's more

506
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,760
Now I think about it, it's unbelievable

507
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:26,230
The tax bureau revealed how much certain people paid

508
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,060
Published in a serious manner

509
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:30,830
With the tax money

510
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:34,100
Annual income can be generally guessed

511
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:38,930
A ranking of the rich issued from 1950 onwards

512
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:45,430
Featured annual publication of high tax payers in the arts and energy sectors

513
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:48,830
Thus, their annual income was known

514
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:53,360
Among the most popular people in all walks of life

515
00:26:54,980 --> 00:27:00,020
In 1993, the 30-year-old Downtown made the list

516
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,490
After two years

517
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:08,030
The difference with Yoshiko Mita, who won four consecutive championships, was huge

518
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:14,490
At the young age of 32, they'd literally reached the top of the entertainment industry

519
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,380
Still smoking

520
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:20,050
This isn't good

521
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:25,150
Until the system was abandoned in 2004

522
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:28,390
Neither of them ever dropped out of the top 10

523
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:34,590
In summary
Showa era and Downtown were a mess

524
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,670
Why do we have to be involved?

525
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:41,340
I did see the rich ranking a lot when we were kids

526
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,240
I've seen it.
-It's true

527
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,800
They made it into a book

528
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,580
And someone even tried to sell it to me

529
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,560
Rich ranking?

530
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,350
After ringing the doorbell, he said that this year's rich ranking is out

531
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,920
Do you want to buy one?

532
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,620
"Matsumoto, you're in there!"

533
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,020
What a mess.
-I don't get it

534
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:05,990
Compiling other people's income into a book is already too much

535
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,420
Not to mention that, you come directly to my house

536
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,830
Why do I have to pay for it?

537
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:16,210
Cigarette smoking while filming was very normal

538
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:19,010
What shows would you do it on?

539
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:21,980
How to say, they were in the late-night slot
-Late night

540
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:25,420
But I think smoking on prime time was also common?

541
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,800
Like throwing cigarette butts at other people

542
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,090
Indeed

543
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,650
Thrown
-Yes it happened

544
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:35,090
He was a professional at smoking and throwing it at others

545
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,030
Competitive?
-Yes

546
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:39,160
Cigarette butt flicking

547
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,990
And walking like this

548
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,760
Like a monster in Space Invaders

549
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,070
Shoulders like that
-Little by little rubbing forward

550
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:53,240
The Nagoya method

551
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:53,240
â€»The Nagoya method of play is a basic technique that allows players to use the loopholes in the game Space Invaders to get high points from their turrets by attacking without damage.

552
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:59,120
Let's welcome the next presenter please

553
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:01,680
Who?

554
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,820
Nanamagari!

555
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,360
We are Nanamagari

556
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,500
I thought your were the car rental clerk at the airport

557
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,890
No, we're Nanamagari

558
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:16,630
Okinawa, right?
-Okinawa or something like that

559
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:17,950
The one standing there with a board

560
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,600
At Naha Airport

561
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,330
I get it

562
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,350
We are here regarding that Nanamagari project

563
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,200
The legendary one.
-Do you remember?

564
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,920
The guessing one

565
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,580
We'd never been on TV before

566
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,760
It even won the Galaxy Award.
-Yeah!

567
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,340
It was an honor to receive the Galaxy Award

568
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,080
This time we bring a follow-up project

569
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,090
A new escape

570
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,260
The content is as follows

571
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:50,530
If you are locked up, if you can get the "lucky item of the day", you will be able to escape with luck

572
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,800
Aah!
-An escape room

573
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,690
A group of comedians will be locked up in a building

574
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:58,660
Somewhere they cant get out of

575
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:05,320
These two people will receive the "lucky item of the day" announced in the fortune telling segment of the TV program every day

576
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,350
I see

577
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:09,920
And we will see if they can successfully escape with these items

578
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,520
Will items useful for escape be given to them?

579
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,220
They are lucky items

580
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,670
So even if they are locked up, they'll surely be able to escape, right?

581
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:20,060
Sorry to interrupt, but Hagi hasn't said a word

582
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,930
Sorry

583
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:32,480
If you are locked up, if you can get the "lucky item of the day", you will be able to escape with luck

584
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,360
It's Yoshimoto again!

585
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:38,520
This time, the challengers are...

586
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:39,250
It depends on who comes out of the building first

587
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:47,030
24 years in the business but with an empty schedule

588
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,710
Too harsh

589
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,160
It's not too late

590
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,600
It's a lie, right?

591
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,460
Eh?

592
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:57,470
Scary scary scary

593
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,570
Please come with us to another place

594
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,870
Eh?

595
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,970
Now? No way

596
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,620
The two immediately understood the situation

597
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,060
The only program that would do this is this one

598
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,050
Please put your hands out

599
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:11,680
Okay, thank you

600
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,540
Still seriously disinfected

601
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,040
How to say...

602
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,410
In view of the current situation, no infection prevention measures should be left behind

603
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:19,780
It's a bit too much, isn't it?

604
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:23,060
Eh? This way?

605
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,690
Super scary

606
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,360
Please get on

607
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,530
Please note the steps

608
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,000
So kind

609
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,270
After obtaining their consent they are gently guided to the car

610
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,720
Has to be done this way

611
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:35,310
Just the two of us?

612
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,540
I appreciate the opportunity but it's scary

613
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:41,380
You know, after being on the show last year

614
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,650
We haven't been on any other show

615
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:46,450
Well, it's certainly good that someone wants to use us

616
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:49,050
It's just being locked for this show...

617
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,820
As they said, a year ago

618
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:56,960
The duo were also locked up for work

619
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,590
Happy New Year! Congratulations on the New Year!

620
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:06,960
These 43 and 48-year-old professional confinement entertainers

621
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,380
Travel for 5 hours

622
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,090
It's quite far

623
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:16,510
It's been a long time, where are you taking me to?

624
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,910
Why is it always 5 hours?

625
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:21,230
They eventually reach a certain building in a certain place

626
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:27,060
Ah, ah, it's indoors

627
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,690
So warm

628
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,520
Warm at least

629
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:34,200
All clothes and personal belongings will be confiscated at this time

630
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,340
And they change into plain clothes

631
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:38,920
Still haven't figured out whats happening

632
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,100
Then

633
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:45,740
Can this be taken off? Eye patch

634
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,280
Won't answer us?

635
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,240
Yes

636
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,110
Take it off

637
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:54,320
Okay, take it off.
-Blinding!

638
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,250
Oh, oh, oh.
-What is this place?

639
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,090
Quite spacious

640
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:02,690
What is this place?
-What's the room for?

641
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:03,260
What?

642
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:06,200
Can't start without reading this first, right?

643
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:24,310
From now on, you will use the "Today's lucky item" horoscope published in the morning horoscope broadcast by each TV station to escape from this secret room and return to Yoshimoto headquarters

644
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,790
Have to go back there?

645
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,310
Yoshimoto headquarters? By ourselves?

646
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,280
More than just escaping from the room!

647
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,980
Eh? How far have we travelled?

648
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:35,630
The earliest broadcast of horoscopes is 4:25 a.m. on TBS HAYADOKI,
Good luck!

649
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,170
Too early

650
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,320
Horoscope program, right?

651
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,600
So cruel? This program

652
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,040
It's cruel

653
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:44,060
So, this time, the two were challenged to escape from the secret life via the use of lucky items

654
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:51,070
In the horoscope segment of various programs

655
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:55,280
The lucky items stated in each will be provided

656
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:00,790
They will try to use these items to escape from this secret room

657
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,820
Its closed...

658
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:07,860
You see, this is a lock or something here, a padlock

659
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,260
Ah there is

660
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,800
Here's also locked

661
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,500
Two locks.
-This is the second lock

662
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:20,320
Yes, this door has two locks

663
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,370
So, the location of the key is...

664
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,150
Ah, I found it

665
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,620
Wow, what is this thing?

666
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,520
There's a key

667
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,590
The key? The one hanging

668
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,490
It's so high!

669
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:42,460
If the lucky item isn't high pruning shears we're done for

670
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:46,000
A ladder or something will definitely not be in the lucky item list

671
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,560
A ceiling height of 4.5 meters

672
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:49,560
Too high!

673
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,290
A serious escape room

674
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,430
Also, another key is hidden elsewhere

675
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:58,610
I feel like I can hear something

676
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,340
Is there something in there?

677
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,050
Eh? Eh? Eh?

678
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:06,520
What's down there?

679
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:06,120
Scary. Scary.
-Is there a living thing?

680
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,550
What's this?

681
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,120
This is a rat, right?

682
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,390
A rat?

683
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:12,890
So big, so big, so big, so scared, so scared, so scared

684
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:15,190
What?

685
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:18,030
Look. Side. Side. Side of the neck

686
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,030
There's a key!

687
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,800
The key is on it!

688
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,830
The key to the other lock

689
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,230
The key to the padlock

690
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,970
Ah so it is so it is

691
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,800
What a joke

692
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,940
The key to this lock is hanging around the neck of the mouse, right?

693
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,800
I can't believe its on a rat

694
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,660
The mouse inside has the second key hanging around his neck

695
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:38,050
Hmm? Where did it go?

696
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,760
Too tough to catch, super fast

697
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,850
So far inside

698
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:41,950
Did it go in?

699
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,090
Come here

700
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:47,220
It ran to the farthest point

701
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,560
Not coming out?

702
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,630
We can't wait for it to come out

703
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,660
Rats can go anywhere they want

704
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,830
If it goes in a crack somewhere its over

705
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:56,330
It'll go outside?

706
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:58,740
We'll never get out for the rest of our lives.
-Yeah

707
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:05,530
Can the two men get the two keys and escape from the room?

708
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,900
Also

709
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:10,180
How do we get back?

710
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:12,650
We don't even know where we are

711
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:15,080
There was no sound outside

712
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:19,560
This is interesting. More interesting than I thought

713
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:20,460
But it's warmer than last time.
-It's warm

714
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,440
Isn't this a daily conversation in the sauna?

715
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:27,930
There is another reason for setting to be purposely warm

716
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,370
Because

717
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:33,450
Where is this!?

718
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:40,360
They are in a small, isolated house in a snowy field somewhere in Nagano Prefecture

719
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:42,450
Wont they be uncomfortable when they get out?

720
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:44,350
Please return to Yoshimoto Headquarters

721
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:53,680
With the luck of the lucky items, can they return to distant Tokyo from this snowy land?

722
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,860
So hot

723
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,100
Looks hot

724
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,050
At this point, late at night, 1:30 am

725
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:02,800
Nothing to do

726
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:04,370
To prepare for tomorrow morning's divination session, they go to sleep

727
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:06,070
Lying down I can still see the key

728
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,880
I'm aiming for that key

729
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,840
I want to smoke.
-I want to have a puff

730
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,840
Said he wanted to smoke

731
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,590
Understandable

732
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:17,330
Lucky item escape room life - Day 1

733
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,850
Quit smoking!

734
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:18,400
Wow the snow is flying!

735
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,350
Here we go

736
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:22,650
Turn on the TV

737
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:23,740
Watch TV

738
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:28,290
Okay, 4:20

739
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:26,840
Get it in one

740
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:34,660
This early in the morning there are horoscope programs...

741
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:41,360
First of all, they watched "HAYADOKI!", the first TBS show with a horoscope segment

742
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:45,930
And this time, the content of the broadcast was sent to the room

743
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:51,340
The two people's zodiac signs are Aquarius and Virgo, respectively, what are the results?

744
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,820
Originally it was going to be you two

745
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,820
So close!

746
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:00,560
There was a slight overlap with their schedules

747
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,960
Great, thank god for the theatre

748
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:09,830
Ah, here we go.
-Ok

749
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,470
Who looks forward to this so much?

750
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:12,140
Opening animation

751
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,440
Horoscopes, right?

752
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:17,230
Not so quick

753
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:17,570
What is this?

754
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:20,440
How long will it take for the horoscope part to begin

755
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,280
In the second part, right?

756
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,710
Later on, right?
-Yeah

757
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,110
True

758
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:26,890
They waited 15 minutes for the horoscope session

759
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,500
Here it comes

760
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,290
So cute

761
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:33,090
Horoscope horoscope!

762
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:34,780
The best fortune today is

763
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:35,430
Ah, this?

764
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:37,030
It starts at 4:40

765
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,600
Let's record it

766
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,500
Gemini

767
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,100
Today you can play to your strengths

768
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:50,180
Language skills and communication skills become stronger, your evaluation will also improve

769
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,770
Wait, this one

770
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:50,510
The lucky item is a glow stick

771
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,200
Lucky color is yellow-green

772
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,380
So that's it. Lucky items are coming

773
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:57,110
Ah, look at your own look at your own

775
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,350
The sweater is good to get

776
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,880
Useful for the snow

777
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,060
These two people on the TV are also Virgo

778
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:11,280
History books, do not need this

779
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,890
History books
-History books?

780
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:16,880
The following lucky item "priority seat" is also something

781
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,070
That's the end of it?

782
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,380
What does "priority seat" mean?

783
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,870
Eh, wait, I want to see the other star signs

784
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,640
Check it out!

785
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,710
There is also a "flower painting"

786
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,680
This is too much

787
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,710
What can we do with this sort of thing?

788
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:34,250
This part is unexpectedly fast
-It's so short!

789
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:37,820
Couldn't see what the others were

790
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,820
Next is the weather forecast

791
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:42,860

816
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,980
The lucky items stated on "HAYADOKI!" on this day are as follows

817
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:47,820
Not great

818
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,600
Yes, the useful ones seem to be...

819
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:54,000
Although there are no items useful for obtaining the two keys

820
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,080
The two tentatively obtained a sweater and history book first

821
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,250
History book is useless

822
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:02,110
History books are really not needed, right?

823
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,350
The most useless

824
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:06,010
They then looked to other station broadcasts

825
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:06,950
So

826
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:09,150

Smells aren't needed

879

932
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:04,170
To increase your luck: a sip of water

933
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:10,350
What about "a sip of water"? We drink it every day!

934
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,950
So far there are no items that can be used at all

935
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,680
Can they do it?

936
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,190
Okay, next is Nihon Television

937
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,910
The items are awful

938
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:21,620
After that, they looked around for other stations to watch

939
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:24,560
But no other lucky items were found

940
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,230
Oh wow, no horoscope?

941
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:36,410
Exactly. The only programs with lucky items are these three

942
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,410
It's too hard. Even after watching there's nothing they can do

943
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:43,240
Not only that, these divination sessions are all concentrated in the morning before 5:00

944
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:49,390
4 o'clock is the most important time in our lives now

945
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:53,160
What to do the rest of the time?

946
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:55,280
Too difficult

947
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:57,730
The bored two decided to have lunch

948
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,280
At least they've got food

949
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,680
That's good

00:41:58,330 --> 00:41:59,250
Sleeping

951
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:02,810

Temporary Forced Sleep

953
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:06,340
After 1:00 p.m

954
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,040

Ah so, the delivery is coming

962
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:14,280
Can I have some toilet paper?

963
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:15,460
Say something

964
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,300
Ah, they won't give it?

965
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:17,680
Why?
-Completely ignored

966
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,700

975
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,010
What about the APP and the web thing?

976
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:48,640
What about the stuff from Fuji Channel and the stuff from Asashi TV?

977
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,460
Ones that aren't physical objects wont be delivered?

978
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:54,280
Non-physical items Won't be provided

979
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,660
Ah, it smells good!

980
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,160
The scent of roses

981
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:05,390
Life has become leisurely with this

982
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:07,700
But it's not necessary

983
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,330
This is completely useless for escaping

984
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:14,920
However, such useless items this time can

985
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:19,570

1050
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,200
â€»At that time, a cigarette was 50 yen, and a box of cigarettes was 800 yen

1051
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:45,200
Really expensive

1052
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:47,800
It's too expensive, really

1053
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:49,910
300 yen per stick

1054
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,910
Toothbrush set

1055
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,310
300 yen per stick
-Wow, that's expensive!

1056
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,110
Its like Kaiji!

1057
00:43:56,710 --> 00:44:00,320
If we don't buy this underwear, is there no change of clothes?

1058
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,520
If the underwear isn't used

1059
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,940
Toothbrush set also

1060
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:06,660

-I want it

1061
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,320
One for two people is good

1062
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:10,590
Lucky Chance is also available here

1063
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:12,860
It's a bit expensive, isn't it?

1064
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
And so begins the life of the lucky item escape room

1065
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:22,080
Will the two of them be able to use the power of luck?

1066
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:27,760
What about escaping safely from a lonely little house in the middle of a vast snowfield?

1067
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,630
Ah~

1068
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,810
What a cruel project!

1069
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:33,580
Indeed

1070
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:35,250
Isn't it just snow everywhere?

1071
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:35,900
Yes

1072
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,750
Didn't they realize when going in?

1073
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:41,530
The snow was removed when the two were brought in

1074
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:46,470
The snow was shoveled out of the way for them to walk through

1075
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:47,750
Then the snow was piled back in again

1076
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:50,190
It was smooth when they went in

1077
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:53,300
Why put so much effort into this part?

1078
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:57,000
Incidentally, in the old days, cigarettes were 50 yen each

1079
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:59,230
The price has really gone up

1080
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:00,360
The cigarette exchange rate has gone up

1081
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,680
It's desperate. This cigarette smoking

1082
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,210
You haven't quit smoking yet?

1083
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:06,630
From that time onwards, I liked smoking more

1084
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:07,920
Its really the best taste in the world

1085
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,020
Really the best! Cigarettes!

1086
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:11,880
The feeling of being able to smoke freely

1087
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,910
Every day, I thank God for letting me smoke freely

1088
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,140
Getting back to the point, we are now looking forward to the sequel

1089
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:19,030
It can't be helped

1090
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:20,960
Surprisingly...

1091
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,690
That's it for this week

1092
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:23,150
Eh?

1093
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:24,270
There's more?

1094
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:27,270
Next week, we will present the final chapter to you in its entirety

1095
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:29,730
Please look forward to

1096
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,950
Next week is the finale

1097
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:51,040
Eh? What's the deal?

1098
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:56,190
What the hell do we have to do to get it right!

1099
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,520
Will the two of them be able to use the power of luck

1100
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,920
From a lonely little house in the middle of a vast snowfield

1101
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,380
What about escaping to the distant Tokyo?

1102
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,470
Going this far to be on TV

1103
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:14,720
