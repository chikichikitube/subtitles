1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:03,440
Tonight's Gaki is ...

2
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:15,150
Let's rendezvous without using your smartphones: Special with Takanori Nishikawa and Alice Hirose.

3
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,950
Downtown started at Alta, right?

4
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,490
You're gonna leave me for a younger woman?

5
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:33,900
We will show you the unreleased parts that we had no choice but to cut due to the air time!

6
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:41,340
I watch every show they are on, it's like my obligation.

7
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,410
We have a different background than they do.

8
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,680
We have class.

9
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,120
Let's make a meeting of nobility.

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,380
We are gentlemen.

11
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,790
But you were just trash-talking me earlier.

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:02,560
[Subbed by RAIDEN1017]

13
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:10,400
This segment is not finished until everyone has met, each going to the place they imagine from the theme presented.

14
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:18,750
They were joined by guests Takanori Nishikawa and Alice Hirose, making a total of seven people trying to complete the game.

15
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,720
Furthermore, if they encounter Matsumoto Iyo, who is the Joker, with two or more members, they have to disband.

16
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,060
What was the first theme?

17
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:42,340
They got into a cab and the game started at 12:10.

18
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,640
The closest one from here is Juntendo.

19
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:54,910
A while ago, when I caught a cold, I used to go to Kosei Chuo in Ebisu.

20
00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:00,190
And it's a hospital that is accustomed to dealing with celebrities.
I think they would come to mind.

21
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,690
I see.

22
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,920
Then I think Sanno Hospital.

23
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,760
They headed in their car to their destination to meet with someone.

24
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:19,010
I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who think I'm right.

25
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,880
After all, this is a game of majority rule.

26
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:30,020
So I want to play this with smart people.

27
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,820
They're not, right?

28
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,620
They are less educated.

29
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,060
Isn't that what all five of you are?

30
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:46,330
Even if they were, I went to Amagasaki Technical High School.

31
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,300
I was in the mechanical department there.

32
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:53,540
The academic deviation for that is about 32.

33
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,150
What did Houssei, always prone to disease, talk about?

34
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,290
Could you tell me again what illness you have?

35
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:06,620
Peyronie?

36
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,560
That's terrible.

37
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,420
I'm still...

38
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,660
well...

39
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:18,630
A man's penis has three prostates, okay?

40
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:25,140
*At an bar, after Hosei told Matsumoto that he was suffering from the disease, Hosei cried and said something unintelligible: 'I have to cut off my penis. But then I can become a psychic medium.'

41
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,170
That's why my corpus cavernosum is hardening.

42
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,810
This is a rare disease.

43
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,350
One in half a million people get this disease.

44
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,680
How's your jaw these days?

45
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:43,490
It healed right after we finished recording "Don't Laughing."

46
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,160
- Nothing hurts?
- Yes, it does.

47
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:54,230
But if I hear there is another "Don't Laughing" recording I will be sick again.

48
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,770
What was Matsumoto talking about when he was heading to Juntendo University Hospital?

49
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:09,380
The theme is hospital.
I haven't been to hospitals much.

50
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,020
Hamada-san likes hospitals, right?

51
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:18,460
Yes, he does.
But he often misses work even with a slight fever.

52
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:25,930
He takes very good care of himself, but he is physically and mentally weak.
That's why he misses work when it's a little hard for him.

53
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,470
I rarely miss work.

54
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:38,710
I've worked for about 36 years and have hardly missed a day of work.
I've only missed two or three days of work because I was sick.

55
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,920
I've missed work a few times because I was sleepy.

56
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,090
Everyone arrived at their destination.

57
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,060
They called to confirm their locations.

58
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,860
For all intents and purposes, you guys should go to Juntendo Hospital.

59
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,400
Juntendo?

60
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:04,140
I'm at Tokyo University Hospital.

61
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,070
Where is that?

62
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:13,180
You guys haven't been watching the news lately?

63
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,380
I'm at Nihon University Hospital.

64
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,450
Nihon University Hospital?

65
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:22,860
If you're in a place like that, you might see former coach Uchida.

66
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,360
They couldn't meet someone on the theme of hospital.

67
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,660
And what is the second theme?

68
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,800
"Places where people who moved to Tokyo go for the first time."

69
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,240
On this theme, they talked about their memories.

70
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,910
First, Hamada talked about his first time in Tokyo.

71
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,220
- Had you been to Tokyo before you came there on business?
- No.

72
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,950
Wait, I have.
But it was in Kitasenju.

73
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,690
Kitasenju?

74
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,820
A classmate of mine from high school lived there.

75
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:01,030
I stayed at his house in Kita-Senju with my friend.

76
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:05,700
And we went to Ginza for lunch.

77
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,140
I wondered what he would treat me to.
He said, "Let's have pizza."

78
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,570
I said to my friend, "What's ‘pizza'?"

79
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,980
"What the hell is ‘pizza'?"

80
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,540
That was the first time I ate pizza.

81
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,550
Tanaka talked about his memories of Shibuya.

82
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:32,160
When I first came to Tokyo, I had a part-time job in Shibuya.

83
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:39,300
- What kind of part-time job did you have?
- I was a waiter at a coffee shop.

84
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:43,840
There were many young female customers there.

85
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:52,510
However, I had thick arm hair.
A customer complained to me, and I had to work in the kitchen.

86
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,310
"He is gross."

87
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,420
"That waiter is gross."

88
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,190
I thought Tokyo was tough.

89
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,030
Housei, who was heading to Alta, talked about his memories of Waratte-Iitmo.

90
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,560
Have you ever appeared on Waratte-Iitomo?

91
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,630
I never appeared on the show as a regular, but I appeared a few times as a guest.

92
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:21,640
The first time I appeared in the talk show section with Tamori-san, suddenly an audience asked, "Is it true that this show will end soon? "

93
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,410
- That was during a recording, right?
- Yes, it was a live broadcast.

94
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,010
An audience said in a loud voice, "Is it true that this show will end soon? "

95
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,090
The studio was abuzz.
Then it went to commercial.

96
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,390
I had prepared a lot of topics to talk about.

97
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,260
But the commercial break came soon after.

98
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:47,200
Tamori-san, the host, said to me, "Your aura must have brought in some strange audience."

99
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:53,640
He was forced by security to leave during the commercial.

100
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,110
That's terrible.

101
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:59,180
There was a teddy bear in the seat he was sitting in after the commercial.

102
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,150
That's pretty funny.

103
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,780
That was Tamori-san's ad-lib.

104
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:09,790
There used to be a live children's show called Romper Room.

105
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,830
One kid yelled, "Penis! Penis! Poop! Poop!"

106
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:22,700
He was gone after the commercial, and there was a teddy bear in his seat.
That happened a long time ago.

107
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,270
Meanwhile, Hirose was talking about his hobby, comics.

108
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:36,980
When I first met Matsumoto-san, I told him about comics and he was disgusted.

109
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:46,130
I see people with different tastes from mine as perverts.

110
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:53,230
- What do you think of Matsumoto-san's muscle training?
- He is a pervert.

111
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:02,070
He uploads pictures of his muscles on SNS at the end of the year and at the beginning of the year.

112
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,310
Yes, he uploads them on Twitter.

113
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,950
So, I think he is a pervert.

114
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:17,590
They chose "Place where people who moved to Tokyo go for the first time" with their own memories.

115
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,860
Hosei arrived at Studio Alta in Shinjuku a little earlier than the others.

116
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:29,500
My memory of this place is Waratte-Iitomo.

117
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,140
And I used to meet up with girls here.

118
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,710
- Did you used to pick up girls in the past?
- Yeah.

119
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:44,350
Matsumoto-san would wait in the car and I would talk to the girl I was interested in.
"Hi!"

120
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,790
- Did you tell her that Matsumoto-san was in the car?
- Of course.

121
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:53,290
"There's Downtown."
"There's Downtown right there."

122
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:02,270
He was talking about his memories of picking up girls when he was younger, but one question came to mind.

123
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,740
If Alice-chan had come here, would a lot of people have gathered around her?

124
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,140
I wonder.

125
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,610
They don't gather with me at all.

126
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:16,050
They really don't gather at all.

127
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,860
- I think they're being reserved, don't you?
- Is that so? Don't be shy!

128
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,330
That's insane.

129
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,530
Hosei was surprised that he was so unpopular.

130
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,440
Later, Matsumoto met up with him.

131
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,280
After all, the topic was that.

132
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,180
- Hey, there's no one here.
- Yeah!

133
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,420
- Nobody's gathered around you.
- Oh, is that what you meant?

134
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,350
- No one is making a fuss.
- Yes.

135
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:57,420
But since you came, people have been gathering.

136
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,630
When I was walking towards here, I thought there would never be any celebrities here.

137
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:05,000
If there were a celebrities here, there is no way there would be such a vast space.

138
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,140
You can still meet up with a girl here even now.

139
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:15,170
I said to the staff, "They would leave even if they noticed me or not. Don't you think they're terrible?"

140
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:18,510
Then he said, "This is how Tokyo is."

141
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,750
"This is how Tokyo is."

142
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,950
People are gathering here.

143
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,520
I was over there thinking, "There will never be any celebrities here."

144
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,460
That's enough!!

145
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,960
How many times are you going to say it?

146
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:45,500
Let's rendezvous without using your smartphones: Special

147
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,880
Two pairs were formed under the theme of "Place where people who moved to Tokyo go for the first time".

148
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,880
The next theme was university.

149
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,150
Hamada and Hirose talked about Hirose's private life in the car.

150
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,220
- Do you drive a car?
- No, I don't.

151
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:11,560
I know where I want to go, so I use a cab.

152
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:16,400
- But aren't you limited to the places you can go?
- Yes, I am.

153
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:25,640
I don't go out far.
It's too much trouble.

154
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,950
I don't think it's nice of you to say "it's too much trouble" when you're so young.

155
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:35,960
You should go to more places.

156
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:40,190
I started cooking because it's too much trouble to go out to eat.

157
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:41,990
I see.

158
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,860
There is Meiji University right in front of us.

159
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,100
Why are you suggesting this?

160
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,870
You think we're going to Meiji University on this theme?

161
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,900
Oh, sorry, this is rude.

162
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,570
And what were Matsumoto and Hosei talking about?

163
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:59,850
I never thought about going to university.

164
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,110
Really?

165
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,120
- Why?
- I don't know.

166
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:08,190
- You had a job lined up when you were in high school, right?
- Yeah.

167
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,820
- Was it a technical high school?
- Yeah.

168
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,190
The deviation was 69.

169
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,390
Don't lie.

170
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:23,670
But the teacher said, "I don't know, but I think that's about right."

171
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,540
"I don't know"?
He's a messed up teacher.

172
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,980
Were you nervous because you thought you might be alone with Nishikawa-kun?

173
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:36,150
Yes, I had a feeling he might be there when the theme was the hospital.

174
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:39,220
I was thinking what I would do if I was alone with him.

175
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,560
Why on earth would you think that?

176
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,530
You wouldn't want to be alone with Alice-chan, would you?

177
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:54,400
But I'm quite a bit older than her, so it's okay.

178
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:59,770
More than that, I would have a hard time if someone like Shino-san was with me.

179
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,240
- Shino Ikenami?
- She's Nakao-san's wife.

180
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,780
I wouldn't know what to do if I were alone with Shino Ikenami.

181
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,720
That's for sure.

182
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,620
How about Natsumi-san? (Hamada's wife)

183
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,630
If that happens, I have no choice but to change my mind and do my best.

184
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:26,500
I have to consider that it will be aired.

185
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:30,470
I only think about how to make it interesting as show.

186
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:35,110
What was Nishikawa talking about at the time?

187
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:45,450
I think we should do this in a foreign country or in a rural area, although those two would definitely not like it.

188
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,260
Those two would dislike working with an overnight stay.

189
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:56,560
It's like doing Strange Town with everyone separated.

190
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:01,230
I would like to do Strange Town, too.

191
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,900
Oh, let's do it together.

192
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,010
Do you watch a lot of this show?

193
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:15,880
I watch most of their shows because you never know what those two will ask me at any given moment.

194
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,090
- All the stations?
- Yes.

195
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:23,790
It's like my duty.

196
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,960
I feel as much as Inomoto does.

197
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,740
- Do you consider yourself as their junior?
- Yes, I feel the same way as Inomoto.

198
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:43,710
When I talk to them, I don't say, "Oh, really?" I want to say, " Yeah, of course I know that."

199
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:49,320
They will be annoyed if they have to explain.

200
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:56,590
They could meet 6 people on this theme at the Tokyo University except for Endo.

201
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,390
It's the only place to be!

202
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,300
Then all that's left is Endo!

203
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,960
But!

204
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,270
Is this for real?

205
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,900
Sorry, I'm late!

206
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,110
Sorry I'm late.

207
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,910
Here comes the joker, Iyo Matsumoto.

208
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,510
The six of them must split up.
They are back to square one.

209
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,380
Hey, I told you guys first!!

210
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,090
I have an appointment at 3:00 PM.

211
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:31,290
Don't make appointment!

212
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,590
- But I told you guys that.
- What appointment?

213
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,800
Let's rendezvous without using your smartphones: Special

214
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:50,780
Starting from zero.
The fourth theme was department stores.

215
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,480
Come to think of it,

216
00:16:54,910 --> 00:17:02,920
it's pretty hard to make a situation where all seven of us are together and only Iyo-chan is in a different place.

217
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:10,360
So sorry for being in a hurry, but let's make Endo the joker.

218
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,630
Then everything will be solved.

219
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,670
- If that's the case, we're finished with that earlier.
- That's right.

220
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:25,180
So, let's re-record the opening and make Endo the joker.
Then it's over.

221
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,280
The rest is up to the editors.

222
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:34,990
Matsumoto, Hosei, and Tanaka went to Mitsukoshi in Nihonbashi, while Hamada and Hirose went to Isetan in Shinjuku.

223
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,630
Matsumoto was the first to arrive at Mitsukoshi.

224
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,530
This is the only place to go.

225
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,530
Anyone who doesn't come here is a fool.

226
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,870
Anyone who doesn't come here is over.

227
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,370
- Hi!
- Oh, hi!

228
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,280
- Good luck!
- Thank you.

229
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,910
I'm doing my best, but...

230
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,650
But...

231
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,290
I didn't recognize you at all!

232
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,720
I didn't recognize you at all!

233
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,960
- It's the only place!
- Yes, it's the only place I can think of!

234
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,430
Speaking of department stores, this is the place to be.

235
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:21,730
- Because this is the first department store in Japan.
- Yes, from a historical point of view, it's also here.

236
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,240
This is the place to be!

237
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,580
We have a different background from them.

238
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:36,250
And we have class.

239
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:43,820
As you can imagine, I don't expect everyone to gather here.
But we can share with each other the nobility of our fellowship that has come here.

240
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,020
That's great.

241
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,430
Let's make a meeting of nobility.

242
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,330
We are gentlemen.

243
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,060
But you were just trash-talking me earlier.

244
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:57,540
The three of them met up in Nihonbashi, the city for adults.

245
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,070
Matsumoto was pleased.

246
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:05,080
I hope this part will be aired.

247
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:10,320
Something is being communicated from us to the viewers.
I still think we are neat.

248
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,190
They couldn't stop praising themselves.

249
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,090
We are not dirty.

250
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,090
We are virtuous as human beings.

251
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,530
It doesn't matter if we are educated or rich.

252
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,830
That is not what we are about, we have something special.

253
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,300
- Nobility.
- Class.

254
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:35,470
I also consider the balance of the show.

255
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:46,720
I feel like a producer, and I think we need the Nihonbashi as one of the spots to shoot.

256
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,320
"You want a scene like this, don't you?"

257
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,220
"Hey director, you want this, right?"

258
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:57,930
- Viewers will want to see many different places. It's a kindness from you to the viewers.
- Yes, it's kindness and grace.

259
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,970
So our body odor doesn't stink.

260
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,100
We don't smell at all.

261
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,570
Their body odor just smells bad no matter what.

262
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:09,510
How did Alice Hirose, who chose Isetan in Shinjuku at that time?

263
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:22,190
She got to meet Hamada again.

264
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,830
You can see the result on the theme of department stores.

265
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:31,460
Endo did not meet anyone because things did not go well.

266
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:45,540
Let's rendezvous without using your smartphones: Special

267
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:49,680
The fifth theme was a golf practice range.

268
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:55,490
Hamada, who loves golf, went to Jingu Gaien with Hirose.

269
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:02,360
I don't play golf, so I am not familiar with it. Are there any golf ranges other than Jingu and Kasai?

270
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,500
There is Himonya in Meguro, too.

271
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,800
But Jingu Gaien is the most famous.

272
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,310
Yes. This theme is an opportunity.

273
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,380
That's right.

274
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:21,980
Endo knows all the places I just mentioned.
So it's up to him to choose where he wants to go.

275
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,480
And it's up to Nishikawa.

276
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,490
We have to meet Endo-san soon.

277
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:31,290
Yes.
This is weird, right?

278
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,730
We haven't seen him for a long time.

279
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,600
He's been recording alone all day.

280
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:46,410
Meanwhile, what were Matsumoto, Hosei, and Tanaka talking about?

281
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:50,140
Alice-chan would love to be alone with me.

282
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,440
But that's impossible.

283
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,520
That wish will not come true.

284
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:00,490
Hamada is always in her way.

285
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,890
This is a natural order of the world that has existed since ancient times.

286
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,690
Is that so?

287
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:13,200
Of course.
There will always be someone who gets in the way of that.

288
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,900
That's what a love story is.

289
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,100
Indeed.

290
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,570
Can you turn up the air conditioning a bit?

291
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,080
Talking about Hamada made me feel physically hot.

292
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:28,580
Alice-chan is probably disgusted with Hamada.

293
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,750
She'll be sitting in the middle.

294
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:36,360
He's probably getting too close to her

295
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:41,090
Hamada will be thinking about touching her whenever he gets a chance.

296
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:45,400
He is called the last sexual harasser in show business.

297
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:52,670
it's said that if he dies, sexual harassment will disappear from the show business.

298
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,980
At that time, at the Jingu Golf Range...

299
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,580
It's Matsumoto, Yama-chan and Tanaka!

300
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:09,550
All seven successfully met up with each other.

301
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:15,260
Where is Iyo Matsumoto, the joker, headed?

302
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:21,070
Where is Iyo-chan now?

303
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,300
I'm at Himonya Swing.

304
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,840
She is in Himonya!!

305
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:34,480
All seven of us are at Jingu Golf Range!

306
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,350
I met Sanma-san by chance.

307
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,260
Oh, you met Sanma-san?

308
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,290
Huh?

309
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,090
- You met him at Himonya?
- Apparently, Sanma-san also goes there.

310
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,760
Why do you look so disappointed!?

311
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,600
No, no, no.

312
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,330
If all of us had gone to Himonya, it would have been great.

313
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,770
Don't say that!

314
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:09,820
