00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:05,250
CINDERELLA

3
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,780
It's about the time to go to the ball.

4
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,490
Yes, mom.

5
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,520
I want to dance with Prince ASAP.

6
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,490
Me too.

7
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,890
Don't worry. You two are cute,
so he will definitely find you.

8
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,300
Mom, let's hurry up!

9
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,770
Wait, before that... Cinderella!

10
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,100
Cinderella!

11
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,470
Yes, mom.

12
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,200
We are going to a ball now.

13
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,870
Then I'm going too.

14
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,050
Do you think you can go to a ball? You are too ugly!

15
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,610
Don't be kidding.

16
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,250
Look at your face. Turn around!

17
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:40,220
Hey!

18
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:46,360
Cinderella, I don't like these shoes.
Please bring a new pair.

19
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:47,190
Yes.

20
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:51,960
Here they are.

21
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,900
Help me put them on.

22
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,070
Yes, sure.

23
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:03,410
Oh, Cinderella. These shoes are dirty. Lick it clean.

24
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,650
No I can't.

25
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,950
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

26
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,680
Wait damn you!

27
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,420
What did you just do?

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,360
Come here! Come here!

29
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:20,690
Come here.

30
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,290
What did you do?

31
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,160
Stop the camera.

32
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:28,530
Damn you.

33
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,170
What did you do?

34
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,840
Please calm down. I'm sorry.

35
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,910
Who told you to do it!?

36
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:35,870
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,110
Hold a sec. I'm sorry.

38
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,140
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,650
Don't monkey around with me. Who told you to do that!?

40
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,720
Hey. Don't touch me!

41
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,850
I said don't touch me!

42
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:48,450
Sorry.

43
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,590
Don't monkey around with me!

44
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,370
Let me go. Let me go.

45
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,870
Let me go! Let me go!

46
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,870
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,770
Let me go!

48
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,010
Sorry... Sorry...

49
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,470
Let go I said!

50
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,040
That's OK. Let me go.

51
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,280
Let me go.

52
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,910
Hey damn you!

53
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,580
Get them over here!

54
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,260
Why are you laughing?

55
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,930
Who told you to do that, huh?

56
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,330
Hey!

57
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:44,810
I'm sorry.

58
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,810
Just leave. Hurry.

59
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,380
Hurry up.

60
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,390
Get out!

61
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,220
Take them out.

62
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,600
I'm so sorry.

63
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,160
Never mind. Leave.

64
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,030
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,500
Leave already.

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,010
Where do you think you three are going?!

67
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:23,480
Where! Do! You! Think! You're! Going!

68
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,690
Where are you going?

69
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,020
Cameras were here and there and...

70
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,990
There are many.

71
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,560
There are many cameras filming!

72
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:46,370
Give me a break! All three were deceived!

73
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,980
Come here! Which camera shall we use?  Which one?

74
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,420
Please say "Gottsu Ee Kanji!" to the camera!

75
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,680
Are  you ready?

76
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,920
Gottsu Ee Kanji!

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,230
It surprised me.

78
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,040
It was scary!

79
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,670
I'm pissed off!

80
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,240
My stomach hurts...

81
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,510
I'm disgusted!

82
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,710
Who told you to do this?

83
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:35,020
I'm just playing along. I'm also a victim, really.

84
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,120
It was scary!

85
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,560
It was twice as scary as Umemiya-san.

86
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,310
I didn't know, so I was shaking over there.
