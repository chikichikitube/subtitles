1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,220
A certain library in Tokyo

2
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,020
It's crispy

3
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,960
Super crispy

4
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,540
You two should do all of it, got it?

5
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,440
That's how it should be

6
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:14,360
The person who draws the skull card will undergo the punishment as displayed

7
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:24,300
Double forehead flick

8
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,540
Ready, set...

9
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,410
Good, good, good, this is how it should be

10
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,710
Making noise will bother the others, so they can't raise their voice no matter what

11
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,740
So we'll go in pairs

12
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,090
So Yama-chan and you

13
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,560
Ready, set...

14
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,730
Ready, set...

15
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,000
This must be painful

16
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,750
Ready, set...

17
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,100
It should be a forehead flick

18
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,920
Not a punch

19
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,590
I'm sorry, so sorry

20
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,470
Please follow the rules

21
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,680
Sorry, sorry, it should be a forehead flick

22
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,220
I misunderstood it   -Yeah, these things happen

23
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,260
Are you literate?

24
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,260
Are you even literate?

25
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,130
Be quiet

26
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:38,670
Subbed by Appieopie, more episodes at
www.laughseejapan.com/user/18797

27
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,340
I hate this game

28
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,470
It hurts

29
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,130
Are you okay?

30
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,520
He's insane

31
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,460
Yoga mat ass beating

32
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,980
I hate this

33
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,160
Miki can choose the card first

34
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,980
Let me get the safe card for every round, please

35
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,120
Ready, set...

36
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,940
Good job, bro, well done

37
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,220
Like a baseball swing

38
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:31,720
You ready?

39
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,440
Duck you head, dude!

40
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,220
I told you to duck you head, dude!

41
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,220
It's about your ass, not your head

42
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,200
Butt's up!

43
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,480
Ready, set...

44
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,500
Be quiet, be quiet

45
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,040
Nothing we can do about it

46
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,880
I can't take this anymore...

47
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,020
Nothing we can do about it

48
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,090
You're the first one who drew the card   -Exactly

49
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,450
Let me take the last card this time   -Sure

50
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,890
*Shin frozen orange

51
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,890
Eh? What the heck is this?

52
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:27,360
Shin frozen orange

53
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,050
Frozen orange?

54
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,360
So it must be stiff

55
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,120
Ready, set...

56
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,840
Wait a second...what the heck is happening?

57
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,000
Seriously? For real?

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,690
Scary, scary

59
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,950
For real, we did nothing

60
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,090
Really?

61
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,200
We have no idea   -This just happened

62
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,050
The audience may think this is fake   -Exactly

63
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,190
So your shin

64
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,780
Which part hurts the most?

65
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,240
Maybe over here?

66
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,290
Wait a second...

67
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,810
Too high

68
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,290
It's stiff

69
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,520
Don't be afraid, it will be fine

70
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,550
3, 2, 1

71
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,200
This thing is so hard

72
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,330
You're in trouble today

73
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,990
What's wrong with you today?

74
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,170
Is this for real?  -Yes, it is

75
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,020
It's real, we didn't do anything

76
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,700
Nothing we can do about this

77
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,850
He's incredibly lucky in another sense though

78
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,360
So Kosei 3 times, and next Asei 3 times, deal?

79
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,290
*Today's protagonist

80
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,000
Eh? What's this?

81
00:05:55,290 --> 00:06:00,350
Today's protagonist

82
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,510
Hey, wait a second...

83
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,750
Oh, you want to be the dealer?

84
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,980
It couldn't be him again   -Yeah

85
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,420
Let's open

86
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,030
Ready, set

87
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,670
What the heck is that?

88
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,280
This is just normal

89
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,340
It won't always be him

90
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,280
Scary, scary, scary   -This must be nasty

91
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,250
Will it bump on his head?   -I can't trust the staffs

92
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,390
This is so scary

93
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,370
What's happening?

94
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,460
Wow, here comes so many muscular men

95
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,070
So scary

96
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,060
Wow, so scary

97
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,240
It's so small

98
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,350
The mat is so small   -Yeah, it's too small

99
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,520
The mat is too small

100
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,880
This is lame but nasty

101
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,080
This is just so scary

102
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,180
He was so high

103
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,100
And he screamed like "kyaaa"

104
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,430
He screamed like a young girl

105
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,780
It was so high, I was terrified

106
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,490
So he's the protagonist

107
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,770
It's not my fault

108
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,830
Crotch balloon explosion

109
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,370
I definitely don't want to do this one

110
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:36,650
Crotch balloon explosion

111
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,870
Let the young men do this   -Agreed

112
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,930
Do this Asei

113
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,040
We are the one who use it the most

114
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,830
You guys are no longer using it, right?

115
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,160
That's why we need to treasure it

116
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,160
Oh, this way?

117
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,200
He's speaking a lot

118
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,520
Sorry, sorry, you're right

119
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,460
Does he understand the concept of this theme?

120
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,520
He's an idiot, right?   -Who's drawing the card?

121
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,320
I hope it's these two lads again

122
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,420
Let's open it

123
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,540
Ready, set...

124
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,200
I get it, so this is how it's going this time

125
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,480
I get it, so you can't be the dealer

126
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,060
I'm so happy, thank god

127
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,700
Let's keep up the pace

128
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,010
Be more exciting, make it more interesting

129
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,540
Then put it inside, right? Ok, ok

130
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,640
Oh, I see

131
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,560
Remember to be quiet

132
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,070
Don't raise your voice, be quiet

133
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,990
Well done, that was spectacular

134
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,600
That was spectacular

135
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,060
So it's no good to be the dealer

136
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,350
How many more rounds?

137
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,600
Asei, you're next

138
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,870
We already filmed enough scenes, right?

139
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,270
Boiling Go game

140
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:24,110
Boiling Go game

141
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,200
I can't even understand this

142
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,590
Why, dude?

143
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,860
You think one of it is the skull card?

144
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,040
So scary! This is miracle!

145
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,870
This is the worst

146
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,150
Scary, scary, scary

147
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,570
What the heck is this?

148
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:52,800
What is this?

149
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,200
Boiling Go game

150
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,150
The person who drew the skull card, please come in front and lie down

151
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,660
Oh, the Go game   -Here it comes

152
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,010
Asei, don't move and stay still

153
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,010
You're the Go board   -Endure it

154
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,360
It's steaming hot

155
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,960
It's so hot

156
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,340
This is something serious, so remember to be quiet

157
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,440
So hot!

158
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,010
Wait a second...

159
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:35,410
-No please, wait a second...
-I told you to stay still   -Show his nipples

160
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,410
Wait a second, this is no joke

161
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,100
Endure it, dude   -No, seriously, I can't endure this

162
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,760
Don't move, dude

163
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,200
Endure it, endure it

164
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,180
What about putting it on his nipple?

165
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,710
Right here

166
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,720
Ouuuuch!!

167
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,690
What's wrong with you?

168
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:14,070
Thank you very much

169
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,560
They didn't even get to play the game

170
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,450
My nipple is burning

171
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:20,730
Asei, do you want to be the dealer, or do you want another person to do it?

172
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,800
Don't do it yourself, let Matsumoto-san do it for you

173
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,640
Me?

174
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,770
I see what you're doing

175
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,170
So that's how it is this time

176
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,150
Hamada Kick

177
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,380
Hamada Kick

178
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,570
Wait, what if I'm the one who drew the skull card?

179
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,730
I don't get this

180
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:42,270
The dealer has been punished for 2 consecutive times

181
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:48,580
What will be the fate of Matsumoto!?

182
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,830
Oh, he switched those two

183
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,760
Ah, he switched it again

184
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,290
Okay, let's open it

185
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,220
Ready, set...

186
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:06,910
Scary, scary, scary   -Scary, scary, scary

187
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,020
Scary, this is so scary   -Incredible

188
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,630
Eh? How come?   -This is incredible

189
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,260
He switched my card at the last second   -Yes, he did

190
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,960
So you can't switch any cards this time

191
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,610
No, no, this is none of my business

192
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,570
No, no, no way

193
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,750
After all this time?

194
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,100
I told you it's not me, just go in front

195
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,880
Come on, no way...

196
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,570
Why is he wearing this costume every time?

197
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,500
Why is he wearing this costume every time?

198
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,300
What the heck is this? What the heck is happening?

199
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:56,640
Ouch, ouch!!

200
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,720
That was so strong

201
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,890
That was a fabulous kick

202
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,890
I completely underestimated him

203
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,890
That boy must be doing martial arts

204
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,740
It hurts so bad

205
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,380
I completely let my guard down

206
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,380
I thought it's an easy one

207
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,730
Seriously, it's incredible today

208
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,990
Yeah, better not touch any of these cards

209
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,010
Me?

210
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:35,640
Come on, it couldn't be me this time

211
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,190
Rotten fish box

212
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:43,060
Rotten fish box

213
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:49,020
The dealer has miraclely drew the skull card for 3 consecutive times

214
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,010
What will happen this time...

215
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,700
Okay, let's go with this

216
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,500
Ready, set...

217
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:04,240
No, no, no   -Don't do what Yama-chan did just now

218
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,030
Why am I being blamed

219
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,220
This one stinks

220
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,040
Tanaka hate these kinds of things

221
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,340
He definitely dislikes this

222
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,530
Oh, so cover his head?

223
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,330
It stinks!

224
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:37,060
Take a deep breath and calm down

225
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,060
Calm down, dude

226
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,330
It stinks

227
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,060
It stinks!

228
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:04,320
He said it, he clearly said it

229
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,840
He clearly said it stinks   -Spray him, spray him

230
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:16,510
Well, yeah...this is necessary

231
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,690
Because he stinks, he really stinks

232
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,400
This is how you guys treat him?

233
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,940
He clearly said it stinks

234
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,940
Tanaka-san, would you mind being the dealer?

235
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,900
So only me and Hamada is left   -Oh, me too?

236
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,730
Not yet, sir

237
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,560
Hamada thought he got punished already

238
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,580
Hamada-san thought he received Batsu already

239
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,290
You guys heard that just now?

240
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,100
You guys heard that?

241
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,510
Shall we stop filming for a while?

242
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,720
Not necessary

243
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,950
What happened to you?

244
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:54,560
I've been helping the last few punishments, so I thought I got punished as well

245
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,610
No way, that's unbelievable

246
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,610
That's ridiculous

247
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:06,580
He gave someone a dropkick, and yet thought he is the one who got dropkicked

248
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,610
What kind of memory technique is that?

249
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,220
That's serious persecutory delusion

250
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,930
In conclusion, Hamada-san and I are not yet punished

251
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:16,480
Not yet?   -Yes, not yet

252
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,800
Let's continue

253
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:24,060
Untouchable deep kiss

254
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,600
I hate this one

255
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,850
Let's open, ready, set...

256
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,360
The fourth time today

257
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,190
Four times?

258
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,000
Go in front

259
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,200
Shall you do the Boiling Go as well?

260
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,100
That's too awkward

261
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,110
-Why should I be kissed while playing Go?
-Here he comes, here he comes

262
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,790
It's always this guy

263
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:02,090
I saw him before, I definitely saw him before

264
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,040
I saw this old man before

265
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:07,040
But it doesn't hurt   -Go, go, go for it

266
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,740
Pluck up your courage and go for it

267
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:26,140
Until he is satisfied, until he is satisfied...

268
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,520
This is so deep   -Amazing

269
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,380
Will that thing break apart?

270
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,750
That would be terrible   -Game over if that happens

271
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,240
What the heck is this?

272
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,920
Feels like being forced   -That's a deep kiss

273
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,980
But well, this does no damage   -Exactly

274
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,720
Only mentally, that's all

275
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,160
Here it comes

276
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,160
Nice shot nasal hair plucking

277
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,840
2 cards?   -Yes, 2 cards

278
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,830
Nice shot nasal hair plucking

279
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,830
Give me a break...   -So 2 people

280
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,590
This is much more risky

281
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,590
I really hate this one

282
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,830
Let's open it

283
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,460
Ready, set...

284
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,640
Tanaka and Asei

285
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,440
Go in front

286
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,910
Come on, I really hate this one

287
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,600
Oh, I see, so I'll swing and hit the gold ball

288
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,000
Ouch, it's so hot   -Oh, it's hot?

289
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,700
It's so hot   -This is tough

290
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,470
Endo is pissing me off

291
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,320
Is it hardened?

292
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,210
Yeah, pretty much

293
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:56,680
Take a full string at the ball connected with two noses!!

294
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,120
Endo-san...

295
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,830
Both of them came off right?

296
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,080
Both of them right?

297
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,290
Is this mine?   -There's so many nose hair on it

298
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,900
The amount of Asei's nose hair is horrible

299
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,040
Wow, Tanaka's is horrible too

300
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,220
So embarrassing

301
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,140
This is so embarrassing, please don't film it

302
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,140
Wait, please don't film this, so embarrassing

303
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,930
This is so embarrassing

304
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,370
This is really embarrassing

305
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,820
This one is both painful and embarrassing

306
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,920
I think this is enough for today   -Same here

307
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,220
Yeah, this should be enough

308
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:47,090
Tanaka has been punished quite a lot of times too

309
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:52,980
A first time collaboration

310
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,970
What does that even mean?

311
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:55,950
No idea how we'll be punished

312
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:57,750
A first time collaboration

313
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,390
Looks good?

314
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,020
-We never did this one before
-We just have to accept whatever comes

315
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,280
Let's open, ready, set...

316
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,810
It's Cocorico

317
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:16,320
Tanaka is being punished a lot today

318
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:22,220
He starts to scratch his head, he's probably feeling itchy

319
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,360
What? What? What is this?

320
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,360
Tanaka is feeling itchy

321
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,790
His nose again?

322
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,790
Tanaka's nose will be destroyed

323
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,490
Yeah, it's always about his nose

324
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,980
Now it seems that the rotten fish box was actually the easiest one

325
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,460
So scary, scary, scary

326
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:46,090
Oh, so the cake will be raised and cut by the knife here

327
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,600
So you two need to move forward, as much as you can

328
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,490
Okay, move forward

329
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,180
Ouch, ouch, ouch...

330
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,870
He don't even have any nose hair

331
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,520
Pull it, pull it!

332
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,670
Move forward, move!

333
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,920
This is it, they reached their limit

334
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,450
They are miserable

335
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,970
You're sweating like a pig

336
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,410
Last, last one

337
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:42,150
Squid ink bazooka

338
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:48,170
Squid ink bazooka

339
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,250
It should be him   -Why me, dude?

340
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,580
Just let it be you   -No way, no

341
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,580
This rule is ridiculous   -Considering the order...

342
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:54,240
Just do this properly, and accept the result

343
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,940
Leave it to luck

344
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,180
Can you open the cards one by one?

345
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,570
Oh, so in a row?

346
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:06,670
Just let Kosei do it, right?   -I did it 4 times already

347
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:07,880
So...

348
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,080
Let's start with Kosei-san

349
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,230
Choose your card   -Can I open it?

350
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:29,700
No, no, no way, this is too hilarious

351
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,500
-There's nothing we can do about this   -I can't even say let Hamada do it now

352
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,500
Being the first one to choose, and showing no shame

353
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,160
Without any sense of expectation

354
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,800
Without any sense of nervousness

355
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,610
You should be punished because of this too

356
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:45,200
Today is just incredible

357
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,950
The dealer always get punished

358
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:51,120
Fire the squid ink bazooka towards Hosei!!

359
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,220
Today's cards are incredible   -Absolutely incredible

360
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,580
Stand over there Yama-chan   -Yes

361
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,330
This looks amazing

362
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:03,730
The staffs are not even letting him to wear goggles

363
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,290
He's asking for it

364
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:07,070
No worries

365
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,740
They said "no worries"

366
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,520
They said it's fine without goggles

367
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,760
Because it's squid ink

368
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,460
No problem, you'll be fine

369
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,500
Ready?

370
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,250
