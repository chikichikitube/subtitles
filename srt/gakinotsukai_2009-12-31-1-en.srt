Downtown


Hiroshi Matsumoto      Masatoshi Hamada

23
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:27,180
So we've done yet another "No Laughing" series

24
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,600
Hosei Yamasaki

25
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,180
The footage is six hours long

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,140
Cocorico


Shozo Endo         Naoki Tanaka

27
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,140
Long enough to welcome the New Year

28
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,200
This was a really tough one, wasn't it ??

29
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,110
I'd say this one was the toughest one yet

30
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,280
It was long, too

31
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,420
Yes, it was

32
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,910
I mean, it was supposed to be for 24 hours

33
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,800
But I think the shooting went way past that

34
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,300
But seriously folks

35
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,870
Aren't we pals ?

36
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,980
Aren't we pals ???

37
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,090
Yes, we're in this together

38
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:54,920
We're a team

39
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,170
Anyway, what's your take on this ??

40
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,460
Let me just say again,

41
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,300
it was a very long day

42
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,960
It was long and...

43
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,020
Where are you looking at ?

44
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,280
And WHAT are you looking at ??

45
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,890
Let's just start already !

46
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,960
Right, we're lagging

47
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,280
Could you introduce the video ??

48
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,480
What a crappy reaction !!

49
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,380
What a CRAPPY reaction !!

50
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,920
What?
Are they playing the "No Laughing" game now ??

51
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,490
Work Day

52
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,110
Unfortunately, rain greets the cast members at the local ballpark

53
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,060
Here come the five members

54
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,470
It's raining!

55
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,780
They seem to be in good spirits

56
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,000
Don't we always dread this first day ??

57
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,240
We should be pretty accustomed to this by now

58
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,330
What's this ?

59
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,450
It says "Wait Here"

60
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,920
Can we just have Shoji show up and be done with this ?

61
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,290
The we could all go home in 30 minutes

62
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,860
This is how Yamasaki was on our way here

63
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:04,860
"Don't let me get hurt"
"Don't let me get hurt"

64
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,570
I was casting a spell for all of us

65
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,770
A Spell ??

66
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,770
A Spell ??

67
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,770
A Spell ??

68
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,770
A Spell ??

69
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:13,470
Please don't be using words like that once this starts

70
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,240
What's with "casting a spell" anyways ?!

71
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,080
Someone is coming

72
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,560
Wow

73
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,120
I've seen that van before

74
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:30,220
Gaki-Nori Van Arrives

75
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,060
I'll never forget you guys !

76
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,300
My journey is over here but,

77
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,000
Enough with cheap drama already !

78
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,000
Why is he trying to make us laugh right now ?

79
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,400
I...

80
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,640
I love you guys !

81
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,900
There's no need for this right now

82
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,510
Good luck~
Hiro~

83
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,740
Good luck~
Hiro~

84
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,020
Those girls had to get up early just for this ?

85
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,900
Crappy gig for sure

86
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,990
What a long intro !

87
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,750
Downtown Former Manager

Hiroshi Fujiwara

88
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,860
Look at his face !

89
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,960
I've seen him in "Monsters, Inc."

90
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,670
You need to knock it off with your face

91
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,220
Your face is really foul when you're squinting from the rain

92
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,810
Here he comes

93
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,650
Where do you wanna be ??

94
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,170
How irritating !

95
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,510
Make up your mind !

96
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,620
Will you guys face this way, please ?

97
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,130
What the hell ?

98
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,400
What are you trying to do ?

99
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,320
I not only lost my relationship, but I also lost my ride

100
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,650
That's one tough rule !

101
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,600
What's he talking about ?

102
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,390
Are you guys ready again this year ?

103
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,990
What was that all about just now ?

104
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,960
Love...

105
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,400
I had to break it off

106
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,870
I'm sorry

107
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,740
No need to apologize

108
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,190
Yamasaki ?

109
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,240
Why do you think I'm in this outfit ?

110
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,260
Let me see...

111
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,020
You're in a woman's suit

112
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,810
Are you supposed to be a teacher ?

113
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:05,180
Anyhow, why aren't you being funny ?

114
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,490
Be funny ?

115
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,000
Ok then

116
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,260
Are you playing baseball or something ?

117
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,030
Don't flatter yourself !

118
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,660
With that being said let me announce that

119
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,500
This year's batsu game is at a Hotel

120
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:26,470
You will be working as Hotel Men for the next 24 hours

121
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,540
Hotel Men ?

122
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,370
Hotel

123
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,070
Toot~

124
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Yes, hotel

125
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,410
Toot~

126
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,330
How would you take care of that ?

127
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,590
Good luck to you all

128
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:51,330
Five newly hired Hotel Men Facing

A Challenging 24 hours Ahead !!

129
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,730
And I'll be taking care of you...

130
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,300
What's with your speech ?

131
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,240
Well...I..

132
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,110
I will be taking care of you all day

133
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:05,480
I'm the hot Hotel Woman in charge
Call me Fujiwara !

134
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,750
As Hotel Men, what's with your outfits !

135
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,980
Go into that dressing room over there to get changed

136
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,860
This again ?

137
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,580
Go ahead and get changed

138
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,860
Before work starts

139
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,860
Changing into an Appropriate Uniform

140
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,700
As a man in his mid 40's,
I sure don't like getting changed outside

141
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,830
You all ready ?

142
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,020
Yes.

143
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,240
Then come out one by one

144
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,770
Hamada

145
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,290

A Shrewd Middle Aged Hotel Man

147
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,580

Good luck

149
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,420
Matsumoto

150
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,330
Yes

151
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,730
You look good, too

152
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,350

Endo

155
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,870
You're looking sharp

156
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,460
Handsome (Once Divorced) Hotel Man

157
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,480
Thank you very much

158
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,530
I'm counting on you

159
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,130
Tanaka

160
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,510
You're thin, but you seem righteous enough

161
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:04,500
Righteous and Tall Hotel Man

162
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:04,860
Yamasaki

163
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,040
Cropped Hotel Man

164
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,510
What is that ?

165
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,180
You're being disrespectful to our customers !

166
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,850
What's going on here ?

167
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,790
Well, this is all I got

168
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,210
I know they're short

169
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,550
Don't think you're funny !

170
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,420
Line up over here so that I can explain some rules

171
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:37,270
Work as Hotel Men for 24 hours

172
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:37,800
1st Rule

173
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:41,370
You are not to laugh at any time

during working hours

174
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,770
2nd Rule

175
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:47,110
Laughing results in delivery of a severe punishment

176
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:47,510
3rd Rule

177
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,350
And that is all

178
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,480
Are we good ?

179
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,920
I wouldn't say we're good

180
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,450
Why don't we wait over here for the bus

181
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,660
which will take us to our hotel

182
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,030
And the game starts once you get on the bus!

183
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,090
Here we go with the bus again

184
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,830
I know

185
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,100
It was a long bus ride last year

186
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,600
It sure was

187
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,900
Let's move on to the bus stop

188
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,040
Wow, here it comes!

189
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,080
That was quick

190
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:16,870
It's here

191
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,340
Here, check it out

192
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:21,360
This is where you'll be working

193
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,880
Gasu Kurobikari Princess Hotel

194
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,900
Or, Suga Puri for short

195
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,850
Wait, should it be "Gasu Puri" ??

196
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:33,190
Suga Puri is the only 9-Star hotel in a world!

197
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,660
Wow, 9-Star

198
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,180
That's unheard of

199
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,500
You're gonna have a long day
if you're laughing at that !

200
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,530
Why don't we get inside so we can get to our hotel ?

201
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,800
At last, here we go again~!

202
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,170
The game starts once you step on !

203
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,000
It really is a drag getting on that bus

204
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,840
Let's go~

205
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,980
24 Hour No Laughing Hotel Men

206
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,180
Sit in order please

207
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:02,150
Man, I've got a clear view of the door !

208
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,900
I don't like how we can see people getting on the bus

209
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,200
Patrons Get On

210
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:13,230
Why can't we just start at the hotel ??

211
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,340
Alright !

212
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:29,910
Bus heads for the Hotel


What kind of traps are set up for them ?!

213
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,050
Let's get there quickly

214
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,740
Tension builds up as the bus arrives at the first stop

215
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,490
Quickly

216
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,560
It'd be nice to just get there now

217
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,340
Arrives at Bus Stop

218
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:02,650
Elderly Man Gets On

219
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:10,430
Stands in Front of Tanaka

220
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,160
I wouldn't like this

221
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,200
Why wouldn't he sit?
There's plenty of empty seats !

222
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,950
This sucks

223
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:34,200
False Teeth Fall Out

224
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,870
That's not cool

225
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,060
That was a quick first strike

226
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,050
Why don't you have a seat ?

227
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,860
I know, there are seats available

228
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,330
Plenty of seats

229
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:59,640
Gimps Deliver Serious Butt Whippings

230
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:59,330
4th Rule

231
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,750
Here comes the first one !

232
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,380
I had forgotten how this felt

233
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,180
Sir, why don't you have a seat over there ?

234
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,860
There are plenty of seats for you

235
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,830
I wish he would sit

236
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,980
I was definitely expecting the first laugh trap to come quickly

237
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:25,540
so that old man caught me off guard

238
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:34,740
Elderly Man Refuses to Sit

239
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,380
Arrives at Bus Stop

240
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:47,330
Masahiro Chono

241
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,130
Listen, you assholes

242
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,240
Why are you letting an elderly person stand?

243
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,740
Angry at Their Lack of Etiquette

244
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,210
Aren't you ashamed ??

245
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,470
Get your ass up

246
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,250
Yeah, you !

247
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,260
Get your ass up

248
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,430
Can't you see he's standing right in front of you

249
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,010
Well, let me just explain

250
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,600
that there's plenty of seats available

251
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,170
Which seats are available ?

252
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,940
Why didn't you just offer your seat to him ?!

253
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,770
Don´t you have any manners ?

254
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:47,280
See, there's plenty of seats around

255
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,780
I was just wondering why he's not...

256
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,190
willing to sit like back there ??

257
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,750
Why didn't you offer your seat ?

258
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,820
Well, I thought there were seats available

259
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,020
You're just repeating yourself

260
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,390
And I was actually wondering why he wouldn't sit

261
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,410
But why didn't you offer your seat regardless ?

262
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,050
Brace yourself !

263
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:22,530
Punishment for the Lack of Etiquette

264
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,340
Will you wait a minute, please ?

265
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,820
Seriously, give me a sec

266
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,650
What's your problem ?

267
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,980
This is too sudden...

268
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,380
What'd you mean: "too soon" ?

269
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,220
I can't do this right now

270
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,750
Why are you....

271
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,880
Hey, don't blame me !

272
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,860
Let's try something new this year

273
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,040
Alright, man up

274
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,250
Wait !

275
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:55,800
Here we go !

276
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,880
The day just started

277
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,330
and I can't do this now

278
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:00,500
What ?

279
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,160
I can't do this

280
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,040
I'm not mentally prepared for this

281
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,230
Not one bit

282
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,960
This is way too early for this

283
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,780
I'm mentally not prepared

284
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,320
Why don't you prepare then ?!

285
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,730
Give me a sec

286
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,630
You'll be alright !

287
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,210
Give me some time

288
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:15,630
Impossible

289
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:18,260
It's all because you didn't offer your seat !

290
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:24,680
Hamada Abandons Tanaka

291
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,620
That was terrible, Hamada-san

292
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,230
Time's up
Get ready

293
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,500
I'm not waiting any longer !

294
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,240
Put your hands down !

295
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,120
Be careful

296
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,380
Brace yourself Brace yourself

297
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,420
Brace yourself Brace yourself

298
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,380
Man up, here we go

299
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,220
Alright

300
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:36,720
Bump !

301
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:39,660
Bump !

302
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,390
Bitch Slap for the One With No Etiquette

303
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:49,930
Excuse me, sir

304
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,780
This is your stop

305
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,180
You hit your head right there

306
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,140
Look, he's still pissed off

307
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,610
Why doesn't he just leave ?

308
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,330
Thank God

309
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:19,900
What a close call

310
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,310
At one point,

311
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,570
I wondered what kind of problems he would have with me

312
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,590
Are you OK ?

313
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,130
Well, I'm just flabbergasted

314
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,830
It's difficult to digest what just happened

315
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,820
Nothing you can do about it now

316
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,130
Yes

317
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,950
Just let it go

318
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,220
Although your left cheek is super red

319
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,080
Well, you more or less asked for it

320
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,000
Agreed

321
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,350
You didn't offer up your seat to him

322
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,530
Man, my heart sinks every time the door opens

323
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,070
I just saw his head

324
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,410
Arrives at Bus Stop

325
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:01,740
Hayashiya Pee


Gekidan Hitori

326
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,550
So, he's the next guest

327
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,680
I'm a bit worried

328
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,930
Are we OK ?

329
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,980
Everything will be OK ?

330
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,190
God, I'm worried

331
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,860
Man, she's late

332
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,830
Arrives at Bus Stop

333
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:40,840
Hayashiya Mahko:    Mao Daichi

334
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,150
Ha ha

335
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,410
Are you serious ?

336
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,430
You took some photos

337
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,700
They're good

338
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,700
Am I in ?

339
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,930
Oh, you got it

340
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,610
Please, excuse us

341
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:10,610
That's rude

342
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:13,210
You can't just take anybody's picture

343
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,880
Stop it

344
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,910
Forgive her, please

345
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:16,750
I'm sorry

346
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,420
Mahko !

347
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,290
You stop it !

348
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,890
Don't be taking pictures without asking them first

349
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,520
I'm in deep trouble here

350
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,300
I'm so dead

351
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,520
Yamasaki, get it together

352
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:36,490
Daichi's Laughter is Contagious

353
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,200
I have to make it out of this

354
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,040
Your laugh makes me laugh, Yamasaki

355
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,810
We're very sorry about this

356
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,130
Yama-chan, get it together

357
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,240
We can do this

358
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,230
We can do it

359
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,150
I'm very sorry

360
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:51,400
Mahko !

361
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,710
Yes ?

362
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,400
You're too relaxed !

363
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,490
Don't you realize we have an audition today ?

364
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,060
If we don't make this audition today

365
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,360
we might as well give up in this business

366
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,320
Don't worry about it

367
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:10,330
I just came up with the ultimate comedic move

368
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,820
An ultimate comedic move ?

369
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,430
And innovative, too !!

370
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:17,040
An Innovative Comedic Move

371
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,420
You got my attention now

372
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,460
Before we get to our audition,

373
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,130
could you guys maybe check it out ?

374
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,080
They're OK with it, Mahko !

375
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,530

380
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,830
Thanks for coming today !

381
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,770
No way !

382
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:40,320
Anyway, as we are actually on our way

383
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:41,730
to go fishing in this BUS

384
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,320
What do you think we can catch around here ?

385
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,860
A black BUS (bass)

386
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,390
No way ! No way !

387
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:55,650
Innovative Comedic Move

388
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:55,650
Ping Pong Paddle

389
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,680
That's enough !

390
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,090
I don't want her here anymore

391
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:01,680
We got it now

392
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,670
Her voice is piercing

393
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,420
Very piercing

394
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,050
Mahko !

395
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,740
Let's do the "Face Performance"

396
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,200
Mahko Shows off the "Face Performance"

397
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,260
This is one of her specialties

398
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,160
Here it is

399
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,860
How're you doing, morons ?!

400
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,350
This makes no sense !

401
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,180
I'm sure you'll do great at the audition !

402
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,570
Can you go now ?

403
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,620
These pictures look good

404
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,540
You got some good ones

405
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,390
Have you had enough ?

406
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,120
I think they're requesting an encore

407
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,220
Let's see who's behind this veil

408
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,320
Sheee !!

409
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,260
OK, will you guys stop ?

410
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,540
What an idiot

411
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,400
Haven't you had enough ?

412
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,250
No more "Face Performance" !

413
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,610
Seriously, we've had enough

414
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,500
I don't want it anymore

415
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,310
Let's just be done with it

416
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,260
Seriously no more

417
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,000
Shall we go for another encore then ?

418
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,230
No, no more

419
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,210
Here we go

420
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,610
You've got nothing left!

421
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,690
Please, no more

422
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,300
What a great turn out

423
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,430
It was a great show!

424
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:47,130
Thank you very much

425
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,870
Can I do one more funny thing ?

426
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,710
This is our exit
Do you still want to go on ?

427
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,180
Please excuse us

428
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,330
What a greedy duo !

429
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:16,760
They exhausted their material

430
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,230
All of it

431
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,150
Look, they're still at it

432
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,770
She's got nothing left

433
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,280
Ah, she was doing Mr. Inoki then !

434
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:34,710
It was definitely unexpected

435
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,850
What a surprise guest !

436
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:41,720
It's been 30 minutes


All 5 members are already in an abstracted state of mind

437
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:48,450
But there will be more attackers coming

438
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:48,450
from all directions

439
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:53,830
We're making so many stops

440
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,840
Arrives at Bus Stop

441
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,180
Can we just get to the hotel ?

442
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,840
Attention, everyone !

443
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,990
We've received an information that there's a bomb on this bus !

444
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,230
We've received an information that there's a bomb on this bus !

445
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,410
Please give us your full cooperation

446
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:06,550
as we search this bus !

447
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:12,750
SWAT in Search of Bomb Suspect

448
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,590
Excuse me

449
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,130
Clear !

450
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,660
Check over there

451
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,630
Clear !

452
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,420
Clear !

453
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:20,930
Hey !

454
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:27,530
Captain Deluxe Enters

455
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,110
So far, all clear, sir !

456
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:35,640
SWAT Captain
Matsuko Deluxe

457
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,480
By the way

458
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,520
Did you frisk these guys ?

459
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,480
Not yet, sir

460
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,590
One of these guys is obviously the suspect !

461
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,590
Am I right ?

462
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,590
Yes, sir

463
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,690
I'll do this on my own then !

464
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,680
Jeez

465
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,560
Ah !

466
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,050
He's freaky

467
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,210
His grip is something else

468
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,850
Did that hurt ?

469
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:23,960
Are you hiding a bomb in these lips ?

470
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,230
You love your baby !

471
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:33,000
I heard he gets up at 8am for his baby

472
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,340
I'm saving you for later

473
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,440
Why is he saving me for later ?

474
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,400
Why does he talk like that to you ?

475
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,610
Are we done yet ?

476
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,960
Hah ♥ Thanks for waiting

477
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,830
Hah ♥ Thanks for waiting

478
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,300
Get up

479
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,560
So I can frisk you

480
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,400
Get up so I can inspect you !

481
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:18,610
A Thorough Physical Inspection

482
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,580
Nothing suspicious up here

483
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,820
Move !

484
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,780
Hold it !!

485
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:32,590
Suspect Flees

486
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,020
Captain !

487
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:32,190
Captain, there goes the suspect !

488
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,950
Damn, what an idiot !

489
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:40,830
Here Comes the Bazooka

490
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,710
Suspect Blasted by Bazooka

491
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,260
Sorry about the interruption

492
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,960
I shouldn't have questioned you
I'm sorry

493
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:05,290
Don't worry about it

494
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,560
It's quite alright

495
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,850
See you later♥

496
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,800
What the hell...?

497
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,640
Why make it so dramatic !?

498
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:09,120
Man, that is quite a stare-down

499
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:16,550
It was...

500
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,960
Amazing

501
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,370
At least Endo was spared from a butt-slapping

502
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,900
You're right

503
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,300
But he was victimized in a different way

504
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,190
Agreed

505
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,960
Being molested by Deluxe should count as 10 butt slaps

506
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,980
That was incredible though

507
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:37,560
Bus makes a U-turn and heads for the Hotel

508
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,530
Why make a U-turn ?

509
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,290
Look, he's still there

510
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,940
Man, he is still there

511
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,110
I think he wants to get back on

512
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,130
Freaky

513
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:49,860
Man, he's pissed

514
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,970
How come ?

515
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:54,130
It's probably my fault

516
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,780
Why so much anger ?

517
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,590
What made him angry all of a sudden ?

518
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,340
The others had to restrain him

519
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:06,480
Can't Deluxe get in with this door open ?

520
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,410
He's coming He's coming

521
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:09,370
There, look !

522
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,540
Damn, he's coming for us !

523
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,390
Driver, let's get going !

524
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,350
Let's go

525
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,500
Quickly

526
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,890
Close that door

527
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,560
We're good to go

528
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,940
How scary

529
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,710
I guess he wasn't done with us just yet

530
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,100
What did I tell you,

531
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,940
we've been on this bus for about an hour now

532
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,940
Wow

533
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,870
And we're not there yet ?

534
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,250
We are SO not there yet

535
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,580
I don't see anything that's remotely like a hotel around here

536
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,980
Again ?

537
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,890
Arrives at Bus Stop

538
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:53,890
Teacher Bids the Students Farewell

539
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,500
Don't go

540
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:54,420
We'll miss you so much

541
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,860
Don't go !

542
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:03,340
We'll miss you !

543
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,340
Good Bye~ !

544
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,470
I'm sorry !

545
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:19,590
Sensei (teacher, released in '72)

546
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,260
What ?!

547
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:34,130
Original Singer
Masako Mori

548
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:34,120
It was drizzling outside

549
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,630
when my first love ended

550
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,010
I hid under the umbrella,

551
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:48,600
standing alone at the pier and cried

552
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:58,590
My young heart never stopped

553
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:08,510
thinking about you

554
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,430
Sensei (my teacher)

555
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,150
Sensei

556
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,210
Sensei

557
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,480
Sensei

558
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:19,090
And you're my teacher

559
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:21,250
Sensei

560
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,260
Sensei

561
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,040
Sensei

562
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,570
And you're my teacher

563
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,490
Thank you very much

564
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,410
She must've been hiding somewhere on the bus

565
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,500
Of course, we're OUT

566
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,650
That was totally uncalled for

567
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:56,650
Just amazing

568
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,900
Shouldn't she ride longer than just one stop

569
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,760
God, my back

570
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,370
after that dramatic farewell ??

571
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,570
Hahaha
after that dramatic farewell ??

572
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:16,610
You find this so amusing, don't you ?!

573
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,580
A perfect laugh

574
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,350
Please keep your eyes open !

575
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,190
I have seen you get away

576
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,620
with a lot of laughs, too

577
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:29,530
But you just openly laughed

578
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,030
But only I get the slap ?

579
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,830
And I get it !?

580
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:41,910
When he laughs solo, he doesn't get one

581
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,470
This is wrong !

582
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,680
It's unfairly judged

583
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,830
I've gotten slapped solo before !

584
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,200
Let's not start an argument

585
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,750
Not just yet

586
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,610
It's too early for that

587
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:01,590
How come the only time he gets slapped

588
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,310
is when I AM involved?

589
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:07,960
Are we some kind of package deal ?

590
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:07,800
Hahaha

591
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,440
I'm sure someone just laughed, too

592
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:18,300
Arrival at the hotel


in a few minutes !!

593
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:23,720
We're in the vicinity of "Suga Puri"

594
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,780
What a long ride that was

595
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,400
What a long ride that was

596
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,590
That tall building is the main building

597
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,250
Pretty nice, isn't it ?

598
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:34,000
That is a nice building

599
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:41,400
"This Year's No Laughing Headquarters"

600
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:49,670
A 9-Start Hotel, providing the best laughts
during the 24 hour challenge !!

601
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:53,280
We've finally arrived

602
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:57,030
Yes, at last

603
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,960
So this is the 9 star hotel

604
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,550
Arrival at the Hotel

605
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,750
We're here

606
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,820
Follow me, please

607
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:06,940
My butt hurts already

608
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,590
This is awesome

609
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,330
This is a huge place

610
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,000
Very grand

611
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:17,990
Suga Puri Main Building

612
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:22,140
Taxi !

613
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:28,440
Sukarno Taxi

614
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,680
How may I help you ?

615
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,980
What is this ?

616
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:42,610
I can't comprehend this situation

617
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,230
Sukarno Taxi !!

618
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,480
Where are you headed ?

619
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,090
To Tokyo
I'm in hurry

620
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,000
Yes, sir

621
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:56,710
Their service must be superior

622
00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:01,210
Sukarno Taxi providing the best service

623
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,740
Can she drive ?

624
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,360
Grrrrrrrrr !!

625
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,260
Grrrrrr !

626
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,820
Grrrrrr !!

627
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,060
Sukarno is a Rookie Driver

628
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,730
Be careful

629
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,270
Please be careful

630
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,810
You don't have to do this

631
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:34,010
It's not in drive

632
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,540
Don't be putting it in reverse

633
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:38,110
Please, excuse me

634
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,660
Grrrrr !!

635
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,260
Beep

636
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:50,130
Beep Beep

637
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:50,610
Beep

638
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,250
There's another car behind you

639
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:56,960
Beep

640
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,830
Can we just go now ?

641
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,040
Let's go

642
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:02,000
Beep

643
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,370
Beep

644
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,640
The taxi behind you is...

645
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,810
Behind you...

646
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:06,180
Beep

647
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:06,540
Beep

648
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,310
BEEP

649
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,450
How annoying

650
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,980
What is your problem ?!

651
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:17,890
What kind of selfish driver are you ?

652
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:19,860
I'm trying to tell you to get outta here

653
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,160
Why ?

654
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,590
Why are you doing this ?

655
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,660
You're the one being obnoxious

656
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,460
Seriously !

657
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,900
Can we just go now ?

658
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,240
Being a taxi driver isn't easy these days

659
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,650
Shall we ?

660
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,700
Let us move on quickly

661
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,650
Here is the mascot of this hotel

662
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,350
A legendary lion-faced

663
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,850
Statue of Suga-Lion !

664
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:59,630
Princess Hotel Mascot
The Legendary                      Suga-Lion

665
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:00,060
I might have seen this face before

666
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:05,430
The tale of Suga-Lion precedes back to 16th century Rome

667
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:10,740
It is said that the monstrous lion used to terrorize the city of Rome

668
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:14,680
And young Suga decided to take the matter into his own hands

669
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,950
Keep in mind that he was just another man running his hotel business

670
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:21,850
Anyhow, young Suga fought the um... battle

671
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:24,750
battled against the... well...

672
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:31,010
Get it right for God's sake

673
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,380
You do this to us every year

674
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,400
No more stuttering, please

675
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,210
Wait a minute

676
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,300
Give us a break !

677
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,800
This hurts way worse outside

678
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,570
It really does hurt

679
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:46,430
So the young Suga took on the battle

680
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,980
Excuse me,

681
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,550
So he fought the battle and

682
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:52,350
And he managed to take over...um

683
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,220
the body of this beast...

684
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:57,010
And he took it over to become...

685
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:01,210
To become Suga-Lion !!

686
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,100
What the hell ?!

687
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,580
Why me ?!

688
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:16,070
Judges need to be more consistent

689
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:19,680
Since then, people come from all over the country

690
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,010
to stay at his hotel and to witness the Suga-Lion

691
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:23,750
Anyhow...

692
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:27,080
what became of....young Suga's battle

693
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:31,720
is now the model for this hotel

694
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,560
What?
This hotel is designed after Suga's battle ?

695
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,730
The hotel don't look anything like the lion !?

696
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:40,630
What happened to the young Suga ?

697
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,390
Where's young Suga in this ?

698
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:45,270
Seriously, get the story straight !

699
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:53,020
Let's get going

700
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:57,150
I'm now taking you to the annex

701
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,130
The annex ?

702
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:59,700
Can't we just go in here ?

703
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:01,780
We're not going in here ?

704
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,550
Another bus ride ?

705
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:07,060
We need to get to the annex

706
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:17,200
Grand Resort Hotel!!

707
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:17,200
The hotel property fits 20 Tokyo Domes

708
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:23,770
The Hotel Men's training begins at the annex

709
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:27,110
Another Bus Ride


To the Annex

710
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:32,280
So he said young Suga's legend
is depicted in that building

711
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:37,320
Anything's possible

712
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,790
I suppose

713
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:39,620
Just look at that again !

714
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,500
That's a mirror image of
young Suga in battle...

715
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,290
Stop it

716
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,080
Will you not do that, please ?

717
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,080
This isn't good

718
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,170
I see zero resemblance !

719
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:02,280
Of course, we'd laugh at that

720
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,810
Fujiwara obviously got some facts mixed up

721
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:08,460
I can't look at the building the same way again

722
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:11,420
That building sure is proud to be there

723
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:14,450
I can't help but to laugh now

724
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:17,960
I can't look at it again

725
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,000
It's Fujiwara's fault

726
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:29,000
Training Headquarters
Arrival at the Annex

727
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:33,210
Newly Hired Hotel Men
What Kind of Laughing Reception Awaits Them ?

728
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:36,580
Here's the Suga Puri Annex

729
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:39,680
Why don't I show you inside ?

730
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,520
This is just as nice, isn't it ?

731
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:44,880
It's beautiful here

732
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,780
Why didn't you just bring us here in a first place ?

733
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,660
Let's line up here in order

734
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,100
Face this way ?

735
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,930
Yes, face toward the front desk

736
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:58,100
I was going to introduce you to the receptionist

737
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,300
But I don't know where she went

738
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,870
Excuse us ?

739
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:16,320
The Receptionist Arrives

740
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:23,530
I'm your Suga Puri receptionist

741
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:30,190
Yes, my job is to welcome all of our guests

742
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:34,900
I will always welcome you with my smile

743
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,470
Because I am the face of this Hotel

744
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,080
I am Bibari Maeda

745
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:47,350
I've been in this business for 45 years

746
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:55,510
To get to work for 7:00am

747
00:39:55,790 --> 00:40:00,460
I have to get up at 5:30am to get ready

748
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:59,670
We thought it was over then

749
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,790
But after all these years

750
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,810
My salary is still only $1,200 per month

751
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:16,640
My salary is still only $1,200 per month

752
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:33,150
She's one exceptional receptionist

753
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,680
Incredible

754
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,660
I'm pleased to meet you all !

755
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:47,470
Here at Gaasu Kurobikari Princess Hotel

756
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:50,540
I'm Suga Hotel's Top Star,
Bibari Maeda !

757
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:55,110
Hotel's Top Star
Bibari         Maeda

758
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:53,830
May I have all of your names ?

759
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:57,210
I'm Hamada

760
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:58,980
I'm Matsumoto

761
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,480
I'm Yamasaki

762
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,850
I'm Endo

763
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:04,050
I'm Tanaka

764
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,410
By the way Endore !

765
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:08,620
By the way Endore !

766
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:14,670
Who's Endore ?

767
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:22,100
Endore !

768
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,770
Where are you from, Endore ?

769
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:24,770
I'm from Osaka

770
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,910
I see Endore is from Osaka

771
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:29,540
I see Endore is from Osaka

772
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,160
Let me ask you another question

773
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,790
Her weird vibe is hard not to laugh at

774
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,220
By the way, Endore

775
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,560
Here's my last question

776
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,320
Do you

777
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:51,100
love me ?

778
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,730
Yes

779
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:56,170
So you love me, Endore

780
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,970
Endore

781
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:09,840
Cut me some slack !

782
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:15,160
We need to make it through her weird act

783
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:17,660
With that being said

784
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,490
Good bye !

785
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:21,330
Yeah !

786
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,760
Yeah ! Ha !

787
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,180
She is indeed a professional

788
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,840
A true professional

789
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:28,110
That was a tough one

790
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:29,470
Just amazing

791
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:33,110
I would never in a million years

792
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:34,360
I would never in a million years

793
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:36,510
think of you as "Endore"

794
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,300
Shall we move on ?

795
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:46,450
This is our hotel manager's office

796
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:47,650
He's notoriously intimidating

797
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:49,490
Don't be rude at all costs

798
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,650
Excuse us

799
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,350
Excuse us

800
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:59,120
Excuse us

801
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:02,070
Line up right here

802
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,640
Sir

803
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,540
Here are your newly hired trainees !

804
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:14,380
Hotel Manager
Riki Takeuchi

805
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:22,020
Damn it

806
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:36,900
So, you guys are the newly hired guns

807
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,150
Good to meet you

808
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:49,330
Good to meet you

809
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:50,970
Good to meet you

810
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:53,380
Good to meet you

811
00:43:56,090 --> 00:44:01,090
Yamasaki is Ignored

812
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,750
I knew that was coming, too

813
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:08,940
Oh, here's the fat one

814
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:23,280
I'm the one in charge of this hotel

815
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:26,520
My name is Takeuchi

816
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,760
Yuko Takeuchi !

817
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:35,410
What the hell ?

818
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:42,770
I wasn't expecting such an old-school joke

819
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:45,960
I've had enough already

820
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,080
I wasn't prepared for that

821
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:51,840
Let me say it again

822
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:55,160
I'm in charge of this hotel, call me Takeuchi

823
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,480
I'm in charge of this hotel, call me Takeuchi

824
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,020
Takeuchi...

825
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,420
Yuko !

826
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:07,950
That's enough !

827
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:19,270
For the last time !

828
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:23,940
I'm in charge of this hotel

829
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,840
Takeuchi

830
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,910
Yuko Takeuchi !

831
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,890
Where did the laughter go ?!

832
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:38,900
How can there be none ?!

833
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,930
Why the third person voice ?

834
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:49,860
Manager's Inner Voice...

835
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:52,390
I'll say it again !

836
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,610
I'm in charge of this hotel

837
00:45:57,610 --> 00:45:59,210
Takeuchi !

838
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:02,210
Yuko Takeuchi !!

839
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:07,650
What a sad reaction !

840
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,960
Where's all the laughter ?!

841
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:15,580
Nice face !

842
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:17,330
These days

843
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:23,400
People have been calling me

844
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,470
the Emperor of the Hotel Business

845
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:30,640
Just like I used to be the Emperor of V-Cinema

846
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,550
What ?

847
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:38,420
I thought this was a good one !

848
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:49,700
My back hurts

849
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,750
I ask you

850
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,500
to do your best

851
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,540
Manager Tekeuchi,

852
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,270
Thank you for your time

853
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:03,840
I'm Yamasaki

854
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,620
There's some commotion outside

855
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:15,450
Can´t you do anything right ?

856
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:18,060
We're very sorry about this

857
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:26,770
Hotel Guest
Kouich Hamada

858
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,780
Being sorry isn't gonna make this alright !

859
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,900
Get me your supervisor !

860
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:30,970
We're very sorry

861
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:32,440
Sir, how may I help you ?

862
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:37,210
He claims his watch has disappeared from his room

863
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:44,480
And he saw an employee exit his room just beforehand

864
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,950
I saw him !

865
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:09,410
You stole my watch!

866
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,310
Sir, please

867
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:13,350
Fake booger

868
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:15,510
Or, was it you ?

869
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,010
What's so funny ?!

870
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:26,610
Or, was it you ?!

871
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:28,230
No sir, it was not me

872
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:31,830
Your kid is too young to wear a watch !

873
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:32,970
Yes, sir

874
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:39,020
What's so funny, huh ?

875
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:53,690
Don't take what's not yours !

876
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:55,950
Mr. Hamako!

877
00:48:55,950 --> 00:49:01,160
Junior
Gitan Ohtsuru

878
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,800
Did you find it, sir ?

879
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:01,280
Hell no

880
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:04,260
What's with you losers ?!

881
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:07,130
You look suspicious

882
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:10,400
Fake booger

883
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,110
Let's go

884
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:23,090
Yes, sir

885
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,680
Shall we ?

886
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:29,850
That was really long

887
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:31,660
Going to the 2nd floor ?

888
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:33,690
Yes, the 2nd floor

889
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:36,310
This sure is a nice hotel

890
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,170
This way to the annex

891
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:42,840
Come this way

892
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:49,090
Here's your break room

893
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:51,710
It's about time

894
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:56,030
The seats are assigned

895
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,730
I have to hit the bathroom

896
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:59,620
I really need to go, too

897
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:06,890
I need to use the restroom

898
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:08,830
Go for it

899
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,760
I can't hold it anymore

900
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,080
I have to take a wiz, too

901
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:20,730
It's been an hour and a half

902
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:23,330
They finally get some down time

903
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:28,830
But they use it to explore the room

904
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,820
I wanna go take a dump

905
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,760
This year all I ask...

906
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:47,470
is that we all get judged fairly on our laughter

907
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,230
Seriously

908
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:49,030
Agreed

909
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,000
Let's be fair

910
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,540
Yes, let's play fair

911
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:57,510
I just checked the fridge over there

912
00:50:57,510 --> 00:51:00,280
and there are some gag props in there

913
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:00,260
Oh yeah ?

914
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,280
Why don't you open it ?

915
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:08,120
This room seems to be more cluttered than previous years

916
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:10,280
Check the freezer first

917
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:11,790
What ?

918
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:16,360
Have you seen that before ?

919
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:17,330
You can't get that in stores, right ?

920
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:19,900
Hamada-san, will you look ?

921
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:24,870
Why don't we ALL look at it together ?

922
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,380
I know but...

923
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:37,880
Sugari Sugari

924
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:44,240
You set me up

925
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:48,310
That looked painful

926
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:52,900
No, I'm good

927
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,030
Come look

928
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:56,900
There's no reason I have to do this

929
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,340
The three of us looked at it

930
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:01,510
You'll eventually look at it, so why not now ?

931
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:05,240
Why don't you just tell me what it is ?

932
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,050
Then, I'll come look at it

933
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:09,550
I don't know how to explain this to you

934
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:10,680
I can't describe it to you

935
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:16,450
What's with your swift movement ?

936
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:23,630
Sugari Sugari

937
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:20,040
Have you seen that ?

938
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:28,520
Your turn

939
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:31,770
Endo likes it

940
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:33,200
Yes, I thought it was good

941
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:34,690
I like it, too

942
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,740
Sugari Sugari

943
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,120
You can't buy that in a store

944
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:43,130
You're right

945
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:44,830
Not sold in stores

946
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:46,830
You cannot buy that anywhere

947
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:50,660
So what is it exactly ?

948
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,260
My guess is..

949
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:56,080
It parodies the original "Gari Gari" popcicles

950
00:52:57,130 --> 00:52:58,260
That's Hamada-san

951
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:06,000
Sugari-Sugari

952
00:52:58,270 --> 00:52:59,470
No, it's not

953
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,900
I thought this was Hamada-san

954
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:08,250
It's Mr. Suga, right ?

955
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:10,000
Yes, thus Sugari-Sugari

956
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,440
Why did you think this was Hamada-san ?

957
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:14,610
It's none other than the Gaa Su

958
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:15,370
You know what ?

959
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:20,590
I knew right away that it was Gaa Su

960
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:22,020
That's why I laughed

961
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,990
But he didn't get it

962
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:25,490
So he didn't laugh

963
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:28,230
It says "Sugari Sugari"

964
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:29,750
Well, I just looked at the picture

965
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:31,190
and thought

966
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:34,940
"Hey, it's Hamada-san"

967
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:39,830
That's not good

968
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,080
I feel bad for Hamada-san

969
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:49,650
You're dissing Hamada-san and Suga-san

970
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:51,920
I have to go take a dump

971
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:51,800
What ?

972
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,350
You're on your own

973
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:54,930
What do you mean, "what ?"

974
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:57,390
That's pretty fast but

975
00:53:57,390 --> 00:54:00,430
I guess you didn't take care of it earlier

976
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,430
What do you mean, "That's pretty fast" ??

977
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:03,090
Since when is taking a dump some kind of a race ?

978
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:14,050
Hosei-san, don't say things like that

979
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,250
We're allowed to take care of our business whenever we want

980
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,340
So don't comment on it

981
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:22,330
And let's put our game faces on

982
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:26,180
What did that package say again ?

983
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,890
You didn't even read what it said

984
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:35,530
and realized it was Suga-chan?

985
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:47,470
Sugari Sugari

986
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,830
It says they're accepting members if you want to join

987
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:47,430
Club Sugari Sugari: Members wanted !!

988
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:53,940
Did you have to point that out ?

989
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:58,740
Damn you, Sugari Sugari

990
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,720
You know what else ?

991
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,620
Nobody's opened their drawers yet, right ?

992
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:06,570
You're right

993
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:08,960
I'm positive they're rigged

994
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,400
Stop looking around, Endo

995
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:11,630
Ok, I'll stop

996
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:17,900
Before their work even begins,
They're Busy Searching for Traps

997
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:22,770
Terrifying Drawer Traps Await Them!!

998
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:25,500
That's the end of the first chapter

999
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:27,710
So, Tanaka received the morning wake-up slap

1000
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:28,540
Yes I did

1001
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:29,670
From Mr. Chono

1002
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:32,130
To be honest, I didn't think it would be Tanaka

1003
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:34,900
Yamasaki-san usually takes the hit for us

1004
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,600
I was thinking he'd come to me, too

1005
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,260
But that wasn't the case

1006
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,370
You got away

1007
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:40,750
You know who else ?

1008
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:42,990
Hitori and Mao Daichi-san

1009
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:44,570
She never fell out of character

1010
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:46,520
She never let up

1011
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:50,090
And I was already exhausted on the bus

1012
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:52,600
What about Sugari Sugari...

1013
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:52,990
Excuse us

1014
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:56,940
Here's some Sugari Sugari

1015
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:59,910
License
Kazuhiro Fujiwara

1016
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:59,910
Takafumi Inomoto

1017
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:04,350
Song by Poka Suka Jyan

1018
00:55:58,650 --> 00:55:59,760
Please try one

1019
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:06,250
Can you blame me for thinking it was Hamada-san ?

1020
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:08,250
Hamada and Suga-san look very similar

1021
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:10,420
Hamada and Suga-san look very similar

1022
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:11,650
You think so ?

1023
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,630
If you compared five facial parts of you two,

1024
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,030
it'd be more obvious to you

1025
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:17,950
Pretty cool, isn't it ?

1026
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:21,450
You can win some prizes, too

1027
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,470
Every single Sugari Sugari is a winner

1028
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:25,820
Really ?

1029
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:29,240
But you have to eat all of it to find out if you've won

1030
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:31,280
Tanaka, you'd better

1031
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:34,740
But these guys just said they're all winners

1032
00:56:35,110 --> 00:56:37,180
We don't know that for sure

1033
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:38,980
Finish that, will you !?

1034
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:40,090
I really have to finish this ?

1035
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:41,470
Of course

1036
00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:42,640
Go ahead and stop the camera

1037
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:43,620
So they can finish it

1038
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,090
Then why am I trying to finish this popsicle?

1039
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:51,620
It's been 2 and a half hours

1040
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:54,700
Time for infamous trickery

1041
00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:57,440
I really wanna see what's inside

1042
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,270
I do, too, but I'm scared

1043
00:56:59,270 --> 00:57:01,740
I don't want what happened to Matsumoto-san last year

1044
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:08,250
Last year's Newspaper Series

1045
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,770
Remember that explosion ??

1046
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:08,480
I could have fallen funny and died

1047
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,350
You're not kiddin'

1048
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:12,980
You could've banged your head

1049
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:16,720
Endo, why don't you open yours ?

1050
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:20,490
Shall I go ?

1051
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:24,930
Endo is the Lead-off Hitter

1052
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:22,410
We have to open these sooner or later

1053
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:24,120
It's just a matter of when

1054
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:28,800
I don't see why we HAVE TO open them

1055
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,370
But you know we will eventually

1056
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:31,700
I don't know at what time, but we would

1057
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:35,070
It might be wise to get this over with

1058
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:36,540
I'm going first then

1059
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:38,150
How many do we have ?

1060
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:39,880
We've got more than few

1061
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:46,550
Mine's weird

1062
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:49,120
I can see there's blue paper sticking out

1063
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,450
What the hell is that ?

1064
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:51,010
Blue paper ?

1065
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,250
Blue paper ?

1066
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,090
It's sticking out

1067
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:54,130
Just hanging out

1068
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,260
I'm ready

1069
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,700
This can scare the hell outta you

1070
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:03,660
which is not really what this show's about

1071
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,340
Here I go

1072
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,470
There's nothing in here

1073
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:10,810
Why was that thing sticking out then?

1074
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:22,050
Masking tape the staff
forgot to remove

1075
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,320
What the hell is that ?

1076
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:26,220
It was stuck there for no reason

1077
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:27,190
What is it ?

1078
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:29,530
Tell me exactly what it is ?!

1079
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:33,540
Well, I thought it was something, too

1080
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:34,540
What is it ?

1081
00:58:33,570 --> 00:58:34,540
but it's nothing

1082
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:36,870
It says "B" very faintly

1083
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:39,770
What do they mean by "B" ?

1084
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:42,770
So this has nothing to do with us

1085
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:46,330
Here I go

1086
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,990
I guess this time...

1087
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:50,880
Nothing

1088
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:52,950
What's this ?

1089
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:54,420
Wow, wait a minute !

1090
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:55,950
This is kinda freaky

1091
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:58,320
This isn't cool

1092
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:57,970
Freaky !

1093
00:58:58,680 --> 00:58:59,280
Why ?

1094
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:02,430
Finds a Pistol !!

1095
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,430
There's something written on it

1096
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,020
"Endo, do not shoot at any cost"

1097
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:11,000
"Endo, do not shoot at any cost"

1098
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:08,460
That's terrifying

1099
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:09,810
I'm going to put this down for now

1100
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:15,810
Here's my last drawer

1101
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,180
I'm OK

1102
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:21,410
Nothing

1103
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:22,550
So all I got is this pistol?

1104
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:26,220
It says "Endo, do not shoot at any cost"

1105
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:28,380
Damn...

1106
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,220
Hold on !

1107
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:33,320
Could you slow down ?

1108
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,330
Give us a signal

1109
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:36,690
Say something so we know

1110
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:37,930
We need a signal

1111
00:59:37,930 --> 00:59:41,170
What do you mean ?
Who knows what's in here ?

1112
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:45,070
Why does he have to open it like that ?

1113
00:59:45,070 --> 00:59:46,000
Nothing

1114
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,740
Mine was in the right-side drawer

1115
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,980
Open sesami

1116
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:52,190
I'm scared

1117
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:54,740
What's this ?

1118
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,250
It will be in the next one

1119
00:59:58,550 --> 00:59:59,780
See ?!

1120
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:02,720
I told you we don't need to do this

1121
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:09,740
Blue Button Found !!

1122
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:08,950
Here goes nothing

1123
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:11,120
Nothing here

1124
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:13,980
So they're all in the second drawer !

1125
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,210
Here we go again

1126
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,120
Damn it

1127
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:22,250
I don't like that new item over there

1128
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:22,250
That pistol is dangerous and scary

1129
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:24,320
Does it say "Not to shoot at Endo" ??

1130
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:28,260
No, it just says not to shoot it

1131
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:29,960
It's full of evil

1132
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,530
It's part of a trap for sure

1133
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:35,130
It's so full of evil !!

1134
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:38,670
Why'd you do that ?

1135
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:41,500
Here's a question for Matsumoto-san

1136
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:59,920
Question

1137
01:00:44,410 --> 01:01:00,290
Name all the prefectures of Kyushu

1138
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:48,230
What ?

1139
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:49,510
What do you mean ?

1140
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:50,310
Well...

1141
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:51,420
In Kyushu area ?

1142
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:52,950
There's Fukuoka

1143
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:53,900
Um...

1144
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,510
You know that one ?

1145
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:56,510
Um...

1146
01:00:57,090 --> 01:00:58,710
Yeah...

1147
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:02,290
Incorrect

1148
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:05,910
How ?

1149
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:14,600
Answer

1150
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:14,600
Fukuoka  Kumamoto  Ohita  Saga
Nagasaki  Miyazaki  Kagoshima
*Okinawa is included on occasion

1151
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:17,170
I didn't laugh

1152
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:17,890
What's going on ?

1153
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:20,410
You got a trivia question when you pressed the button

1154
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:26,650
Blue Button --> Trivia Question

1155
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,520
You didn't answer it right, so you got the butt-slap

1156
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:23,290
Is that how it is ?

1157
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:25,200
Nobody laughed

1158
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:28,950
What's in your drawer ?

1159
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,030
What ?

1160
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:41,730
So you got the red one

1161
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:45,200
Red Button Found !!

1162
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:47,080
Just to make sure

1163
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,970
So one button for each of us

1164
01:01:57,610 --> 01:02:02,080
Butterfly from the Drawer !!

1165
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,810
Amazing

1166
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:06,960
It's a nice touch

1167
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,980
It's a real butterfly, too

1168
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:15,500
This is a rare butterfly !

1169
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,530
Wait, there's more underneath you

1170
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:20,150
We should have let them out earlier

1171
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:28,610
What kind of butterfly is this, Tanaka ?

1172
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:28,550
I'm not quite sure about this one

1173
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:45,910
It's taking a nice break

1174
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:47,970
What a calm butterfly

1175
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:58,280
My back is killin'

1176
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,000
Who would've thought...

1177
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:05,280
Yama-chan, why don't you open yours ?

1178
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:06,590
This is scary

1179
01:03:06,590 --> 01:03:08,560
You know there's gotta be something in there

1180
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,220
What ?

1181
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:12,890
DVD's

1182
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:16,790
Of course, there's a DVD player over there

1183
01:03:16,830 --> 01:03:17,680
You're right

1184
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:19,140
We have two

1185
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:21,830
Mysterious DVD x 2

1186
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:21,380
What else is in there ?

1187
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:25,280
Nothing

1188
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:28,940
That drawer should be it

1189
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:30,150
Here it is

1190
01:03:30,070 --> 01:03:33,140
Green Button  Found !!

1191
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:31,970
What did I tell you ?

1192
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:32,870
Green

1193
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:35,020
Next one is green

1194
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:39,310
Nothing

1195
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:40,860
Damn..

1196
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:43,980
Too many uncertainties

1197
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:46,220
Your turn, Tanaka

1198
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:50,060
Let's go, Tanaka

1199
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:50,060
This is a bit scary

1200
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:51,830
This is a bit scary

1201
01:03:50,170 --> 01:03:52,340
How come Endo got no button ?

1202
01:03:58,670 --> 01:03:59,370
There's something inside

1203
01:03:59,370 --> 01:04:01,540
It's a panel

1204
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:02,410
Panel ?

1205
01:04:02,470 --> 01:04:06,470
Suspicious Panel !

1206
01:04:04,670 --> 01:04:07,170
Think this through before you pull it out

1207
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:18,280
Pull it out like this

1208
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:19,650
toward you

1209
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,710
Well, we don't know which side is which

1210
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:42,640
Thumbtacks through
Yamasaki's nose

1211
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:42,610
What's with the juvenile gag ?

1212
01:04:49,450 --> 01:05:10,070
Thumbtacks through
Yamasaki's nose

1213
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:51,470
This is so childish

1214
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:53,170
Very childish

1215
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:55,760
And why you two ?

1216
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:03,590
But seriously,

1217
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:06,700
Why me and Hamada-san ?

1218
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,220
Anything else ?

1219
01:05:10,530 --> 01:05:11,460
Here I go

1220
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:14,710
There it is

1221
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:18,910
Purple Button Found !!

1222
01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:15,840
I knew it

1223
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:18,130
One for each of us

1224
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:19,080
Well, I got the pistol

1225
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:21,100
A purple button

1226
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:25,620
I'm curious about the DVD's

1227
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:27,720
I've got a bad feeling about those

1228
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:29,390
Why did you get two ?

1229
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:35,160
Shall we watch these ?

1230
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:35,400
No, no way

1231
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:36,620
I don't want them

1232
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:39,600
But why two ?

1233
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:39,850
I was wondering about that myself

1234
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:40,520
Before you move on,

1235
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,440
why don't you push that button first ?

1236
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:43,000
So that

1237
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,140
I can change my course of action

1238
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:47,170
So play the DVDs later

1239
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:48,100
Yeah

1240
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:49,380
I'm going for it

1241
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,080
Here I go !

1242
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:04,330
Street Survey Derby

1243
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:04,330
Who do you think should get a butt slap ?

1244
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:09,830
Excuse me, but I'm from Nihon TV

1245
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:09,930
Yes ?

1246
01:06:09,950 --> 01:06:11,400
I'm from Nihon TV

1247
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:13,410
Do you have some time ?

1248
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:14,630
OK

1249
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:16,170
Are you on your way home ?

1250
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:17,740
Yes, I'm on my way home

1251
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:20,310
To your loving wife ?

1252
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:23,440
Well, I'm here on business,

1253
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,610
so I don't actually get to see my wife tonight

1254
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:29,420
I'm actually doing some work for "Gaki No Tsukai"

1255
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:32,090
I love that show !!

1256
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,560
Can you participate in this survey then ?

1257
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:38,060
Who do you think should get his butt slapped ?

1258
01:06:39,490 --> 01:06:41,460
I'd say Hama-chan ! Yes !!

1259
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:44,000
He kicks (other guests) too much !

1260
01:06:49,010 --> 01:06:51,050
So, I'm OUT ?

1261
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,560
You're kiddin' ??

1262
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:56,260
So whomever they choose gets slapped

1263
01:06:55,380 --> 01:07:00,610
Green Button --> Street Survey

1264
01:06:56,270 --> 01:06:57,620
That's all it takes ?

1265
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:03,550
I thought you got caught laughing

1266
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:03,390
When ?

1267
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:04,040
Just now

1268
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:05,280
I thought he laughed at that survey

1269
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,830
No, I don't think so

1270
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:08,190
He simply got chosen

1271
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:10,760
You get a slap for each vote

1272
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:13,430
Who the hell is gonna push that button then ?

1273
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:15,900
What's with this survey ?

1274
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:17,200
Here I go again

1275
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:22,300
You serious ?

1276
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:26,540
Street Survey Derby

1277
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:26,540
Who do you think should get a butt slap ?

1278
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:26,540
I'm praying that it won't be me

1279
01:07:27,410 --> 01:08:13,490
Who do you think should
get butt slapped ?

1280
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,310
Yamasaki-san

1281
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:33,240
Because that's his character

1282
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,310
Because that's his character

1283
01:07:34,310 --> 01:07:36,550
Hamada-san

1284
01:07:36,550 --> 01:07:40,290
Becasue he's always abusing the others

1285
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:43,490
Hosei Yamasaki

1286
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:45,660
Tanaka-san

1287
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:47,860
Why ?

1288
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:49,600
Because he's not cool

1289
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:52,200
Hama-chan

1290
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:54,670
Hitoshi Matsumoto

1291
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:56,040
His shaved head is blinding

1292
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:57,770
Hosei Yamasaki

1293
01:07:58,140 --> 01:07:59,810
Any reason why ?

1294
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:01,740
No...

1295
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:04,140
Matsumoto-san

1296
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:06,350
My gut feeling tells me so

1297
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:08,150
Hamada-san

1298
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:11,090
Because he's gross

1299
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:13,550
I'd say Yamasaki-san

1300
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:21,260
Champion:       Hosei Yamasaki

1301
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:21,260
Person Most Deserving of Butt Slap

1302
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:21,260
Street Survey Derby

1303
01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:26,700
So we're free to laugh at this then ?

1304
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:28,410
Tanaka was laughing, too

1305
01:08:28,410 --> 01:08:30,770
So we can laugh all we want ?

1306
01:08:36,790 --> 01:08:39,220
OK, so you DO get slapped for laughing

1307
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:41,670
Man, there's no time to relax

1308
01:08:44,790 --> 01:08:48,020
Rules are becoming very confusing

1309
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:50,390
That green button is not my favorite

1310
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:53,060
Shall we watch the DVD ?

1311
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:54,600
Let's watch it

1312
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,850
I'll pick the one in my left hand

1313
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,140
Do you know which one was which ?

1314
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:01,340
Yes, I stacked it so I'd remember

1315
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:07,410
Anything's safer than this pistol

1316
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:10,020
Well, we'll eventually have to shoot this

1317
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:11,800
There's a definite "dangerous" element to it

1318
01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:14,780
Look, there's that butterfly above the TV

1319
01:09:16,770 --> 01:09:18,780
Can we take care of that somehow ?

1320
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:21,850
It's right in the middle

1321
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:34,520
Angel with Broken Wings

Lyrics by

1324
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:42,080
Rain is falling down sideways

1325
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:45,850
straight into the driver's seat

1326
01:09:45,850 --> 01:09:49,080
No need to bother with the wipers

1327
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:51,850
in this hurricane

1328
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:57,290
I can't hear you say "I love you"

1329
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,930
So I put my ears close to your mouth

1330
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:07,610
Rain washes our feelings away on this freeway

1331
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:16,390
If I were a superhero

1332
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:24,400
I would fight off your sadness

1333
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:31,730
But I'm still feeling despair

1334
01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:39,030
because I can't agree with your whispering words

1335
01:10:39,090 --> 01:10:41,010
Uh...

1336
01:10:41,010 --> 01:10:41,830
Yamasaki OUT Angel

1337
01:10:41,830 --> 01:10:42,700
Yamasaki OUT Angel

1338
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:44,840
Yamasaki OUT Angel

1339
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:48,600
And Tanaka, too

1340
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:52,520
Yamasaki OUT Angel

1341
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:53,690
Tanaka 2-Slaps Angel

1342
01:10:53,690 --> 01:10:54,300
Tanaka 2-Slaps Angel

1343
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:57,300
Tanaka 2-Slaps Angel

1344
01:11:02,790 --> 01:11:03,680
Why me !?

1345
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:05,360
This isn't fair

1346
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,250
What does this mean ?

1347
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:09,630
You even get two slaps

1348
01:11:16,550 --> 01:11:17,360
What ?

1349
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:19,650
This is nonsense

1350
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:21,380
This is just plain wrong

1351
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:22,900
Stop it !

1352
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:32,230
What was that all about ?

1353
01:11:32,630 --> 01:11:33,760
What the hell was that ?

1354
01:11:33,850 --> 01:11:36,960
What is "Yamasaki OUT Angel ?"

1355
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,130
Well, I get "Yamasaki OUT Angel"

1356
01:11:39,130 --> 01:11:42,530
But what's "Tanaka 2-Slaps Angel ??"

1357
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:46,400
Let's put this away

1358
01:11:46,910 --> 01:11:47,970
Yeah, put it away

1359
01:11:48,150 --> 01:11:49,370
Get that angel outta here

1360
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:52,170
And put in the second angel

1361
01:11:50,990 --> 01:11:51,860
Should we ?

1362
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:55,140
That took them some preparation

1363
01:11:55,130 --> 01:11:57,710
That was the real singer

1364
01:11:57,710 --> 01:12:00,650
How could you have avoided the slap anyway ?

When it's sweet,

1370
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:13,830
my heart sings

1371
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:16,960
I'm feeling nervous

1372
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:19,600
at what's to happen tonight

1373
01:12:20,890 --> 01:12:27,040
I can see the lit candle in your eyes

1374
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:32,910
And I'll carelessly dance in your eyes

MEMBERS ALL OUT

1378
01:12:35,930 --> 01:12:40,250
Tanaka's OUT for good

1379
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,220
MEMBERS ALL OUT

1380
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:42,730
Slap Tanaka twice

1381
01:12:42,730 --> 01:12:43,230
Slap Tanaka twice

1382
01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:44,930
Slap Tanaka twice

1383
01:12:49,310 --> 01:12:50,240
Why me ?

1384
01:12:52,730 --> 01:12:54,450
Out of control

1385
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:56,320
Why me ?

1386
01:13:06,930 --> 01:13:08,720
This must be for us laughing then

1387
01:13:16,490 --> 01:13:17,960
I'm taking it out

1388
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:18,600
Good idea

1389
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:20,470
It's definitely put together well

1390
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:23,030
This isn't nice

1391
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:26,750
Slap Tanaka twice ~

1392
01:13:27,730 --> 01:13:32,070
What do we do with Endo's pistol ?

1393
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:35,980
Well, it says not to shoot it

1394
01:13:36,690 --> 01:13:39,460
"Endo, do not shoot at any cost"

1395
01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:44,520
Endo, it might be better to get it over with now

1396
01:13:43,290 --> 01:13:44,350
Agreed

1397
01:13:46,050 --> 01:13:47,370
What are you gonna do with it ?

1398
01:13:48,010 --> 01:13:50,150
I know enough not to aim this at anyone

1399
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:51,290
Of course not

1400
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:53,460
How should I....??

1401
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:55,280
Should I aim down ?

1402
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,380
If it were me, I wouldn't do it

1403
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:55,890
Yeah

1404
01:13:57,830 --> 01:13:58,820
Give us a signal

1405
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:00,400
Let us know before you shoot

1406
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:04,200
I'm ready !

1407
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:18,290
Pistol --> Shoot it and get shot

1408
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:25,700
This is just way outta hand

1409
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:30,900
This is way out of control

1410
01:14:31,130 --> 01:14:32,360
Out of control

1411
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:35,500
It smells like fire cracker powder

1412
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:39,270
That stinks

1413
01:14:39,570 --> 01:14:41,210
But it's only Siccarol

1414
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:43,940
What is Siccarol ?

1415
01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:47,250
What's Siccarol ?

1416
01:14:46,930 --> 01:14:48,860
Siccarol ??

1417
01:14:49,290 --> 01:14:51,000
You know what Siccarol is...

1418
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,650
We use it on babies

1419
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:53,550
You're laughing right now

1420
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:08,130
I wasn't laughing just then

1421
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:09,930
You did it to yourself

1422
01:15:09,930 --> 01:15:11,300
It's called Siccarol ?

1423
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:12,910
Isn't it baby powder ?

1424
01:15:12,910 --> 01:15:14,980
Or, Talcum powder ?

1425
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:20,680
It's Talcum powder

1426
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:23,180
I told you it's Siccarol...

1427
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:25,730
It's noon

1428
01:15:25,970 --> 01:15:28,730
And there's more than just drawer traps...

1429
01:15:30,890 --> 01:15:33,230
There's nothing to do in this hotel

1430
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:35,700
We haven't learned anything yet

1431
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:36,970
Would you care for some drinks ?

1432
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:38,770
Maybe some tea ?

1433
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:39,360
We have some ?

1434
01:15:39,330 --> 01:15:39,760
Yes

1435
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:40,870
There's juice, too

1436
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:42,200
Juice ?

1437
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:43,580
Some Sports drinks, too

1438
01:15:44,570 --> 01:15:46,870
We had coffee and stuff last year

1439
01:15:48,530 --> 01:15:50,630
Any hot drinks ?

1440
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:52,070
Oh, I see them

1441
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:54,010
But they're all teas

1442
01:15:53,870 --> 01:15:54,910
What's this then ?

1443
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:58,350
Hot tea sounds good to me

1444
01:15:58,350 --> 01:16:00,420
Would you like a "Suga Tea ?"

1445
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:03,470
"Suga Tea"

1446
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:13,000
I'll pass

1447
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:13,000
Me, too

1448
01:16:13,130 --> 01:16:16,140
I'll try some "Suga Tea"

1449
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:18,000
What's in "Suga Tea ?"

1450
01:16:19,510 --> 01:16:20,320
Wow, what's this ?

1451
01:16:20,510 --> 01:16:21,890
It's milky white

1452
01:16:21,890 --> 01:16:32,590
Suga Tea

1453
01:16:24,510 --> 01:16:27,510
I can't drink this

1454
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:28,820
Is it spoiled ?

1455
01:16:31,050 --> 01:16:32,590
It's spoiled

1456
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:38,260
This could split my intestine

1457
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:41,560
What kind of tea can split your intestine ?

1458
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:43,660
There, he laughed !

1459
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,270
Why point fingers ?

1460
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:50,470
Let them make their own decisions !

1461
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:51,660
You don't need to point fingers at me

1462
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:54,640
He didn't even try to hide his laugh

1463
01:16:52,950 --> 01:16:54,220
A complete laugh

1464
01:16:56,490 --> 01:16:59,150
It gets my back

1465
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:02,920
Man, what's this ?

1466
01:17:02,370 --> 01:17:03,680
We don't know

1467
01:17:03,850 --> 01:17:04,950
Ramen ?!

1468
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:15,100
This has to be soup for ramen

1469
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:17,240
What is this ?

1470
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:23,780
Suga Tea ---> Pork Flavored Soup

1471
01:17:26,940 --> 01:17:28,140
So they made this for the show

1472
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:29,470
Yeah, they did

1473
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:30,390
I see it now

1474
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,350
Did you say, "Yeah, they did" to Hamada ?

1475
01:17:32,350 --> 01:17:35,870
You have no respect for him, do you ?

1476
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:45,620
That is strict

1477
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:50,830
Hot !!

1478
01:17:53,170 --> 01:17:54,830
Hot !

1479
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:58,910
Wait a minute !!

1480
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:03,030
That wasn't part of the deal

1481
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:11,050
That was freakin' Hot !!

1482
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:18,100
What a disaster

1483
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:18,150
That wasn't fair

1484
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:21,060
Man, the floor's soaked

1485
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:23,600
Let's clean it up

1486
01:18:26,930 --> 01:18:29,640
Wow, you dumped the whole thing

1487
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:38,910
Listen guys

1488
01:18:38,910 --> 01:18:42,920
I know you're becoming more accustomed to things

1489
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:47,150
but here's a hotel public relations video.

1490
01:18:47,150 --> 01:18:49,220
Why don't we watch it ?

1491
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:55,560
Introduction to Hotel Video

1492
01:18:56,630 --> 01:18:57,760
Let's pay attention

1493
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:05,920
Plenty of sunshine warms the untouched natural setting

1494
01:19:06,710 --> 01:19:11,450
We offer the best amenities and activities to fit your holiday needs

1495

1496
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:23,510
We're located one hour from the city center

1497
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:27,750
Our grand entrance welcomes you with open arms

1498
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:33,010
Our lobby has high ceilings, creating a wide open space

1499
01:19:33,010 --> 01:19:35,490
and it will make you feel comfortable and relaxed

1500
01:19:38,380 --> 01:19:41,080
Our orderly and luxurious front desk

1501
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:44,890
is constructed mainly with marble stones

1502
01:19:47,530 --> 01:19:49,990
Our experienced staff will make you feel at home

1503
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:52,700
She shows up way too much

1504
01:19:52,330 --> 01:19:56,370
and help you make your stay a pleasant one

1505
01:19:57,290 --> 01:19:59,090
Chiaki, are we good to go ?

1506
01:19:58,120 --> 01:19:58,810
Yes

1507
01:19:59,090 --> 01:20:00,670
Let's go

1508
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:10,450
We offer a variety of rooms including our suites

1509
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:13,620
to fit anybody's vacationing needs

1510
01:20:15,250 --> 01:20:18,830
Not only can you enjoy the view from your room,

1511
01:20:19,870 --> 01:20:26,150
but also take in all the fresh air by renting our bicycles

1512
01:20:24,370 --> 01:20:26,050
What the hell's this old man doing here ?

1513
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:33,060
We also offer many outside activities including

1514
01:20:34,010 --> 01:20:37,030
full 18 holes of golf

1515
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:39,770
and tennis courts just to name a few

1516
01:20:39,950 --> 01:20:43,050
It is indeed perfect for those planning vacations in groups

1517
01:20:43,190 --> 01:20:46,560
We encourage you to invites all of your friends and family to

1518

1519
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:56,930
And let's not forget that this is also a perfect spot to facilitate your company picnics

1520
01:20:58,310 --> 01:20:59,370
Nice shot, Chiaki

1521
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:00,440
Yeah

1522
01:21:00,910 --> 01:21:01,600
Nice

1523
01:21:06,340 --> 01:21:09,060
For those looking to pamper yourself,

1524
01:21:09,230 --> 01:21:11,170
Why not visit our esthetic's ?

1525
01:21:12,590 --> 01:21:14,320
Welcome

1526
01:21:16,690 --> 01:21:22,290
We use only the best massaging oil

1527
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:27,480

1528
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:33,860
For our facial massage,

How does that feel ?

1531
01:21:42,370 --> 01:21:45,720
Natsumi Ogawa
Hamada's wife

1532
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:49,200
How does that feel ?

1533
01:21:53,730 --> 01:21:56,630
Your face sure will thank you later

1534
01:21:57,250 --> 01:22:00,840
What the hell is this all about ?

1535
01:22:00,970 --> 01:22:02,640
This is an amazing footage in so many ways

1536
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:05,460
What the hell is she doing ??

1537
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:10,910
Our esthetician can also massage your tired legs

1538
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:14,490
How am I doing ?

1539
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:16,410
This is incredible

1540
01:22:16,410 --> 01:22:18,230
This is really incredible

1541
01:22:17,870 --> 01:22:19,290
Huh ?

1542
01:22:20,420 --> 01:22:24,480
We offer extensive exercise options outdoors

1543
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:30,310
Including our indoor Olympic size swimming pool

1544
01:22:30,790 --> 01:22:32,780
where you can refresh your body

1545
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:40,120
Of course, you're free to meet and make friends

1546
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:40,420
Wow, she's all over the place !

1547
01:22:40,130 --> 01:22:44,030
between your swimming trainings by our poolside lawn chairs

1548
01:22:40,420 --> 01:22:41,820
What's she doing here ?

1549
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:43,820
What kind of footage is this ?

1550
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:45,620
What kind of footage is this ?

1551
01:22:48,620 --> 01:22:50,520
Is she supposed to be an instructor ?

1552
01:22:53,030 --> 01:22:54,770
As the night falls,

1553
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:58,490
how about a drink or two at our classy bar ?

1554
01:22:59,510 --> 01:23:00,880
Cheers

1555
01:23:02,670 --> 01:23:05,870
Our trained bartender can offer you

1556
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:08,310
best specialty cocktails that you both can enjoy

1557
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:11,520
I love you, Chiaki

1558
01:23:13,150 --> 01:23:15,660
Do you like me ?

1559
01:23:19,230 --> 01:23:21,620
That was too much

1560
01:23:21,050 --> 01:23:23,610
Of course, the bar is setup for you to socialize

1561
01:23:24,270 --> 01:23:30,990
and great opportunities to make friends from all over the world

1562
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:29,020
Man, she really is all over the place

1563
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:39,320
Japanese Style Lodging

1564
01:23:34,670 --> 01:23:38,130
If your group favors a more traditional arrangement

1565
01:23:38,530 --> 01:23:41,080
why not enjoy your stay at our Japanese style lodge ?

1566
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:47,190
Our beautiful Geisha will ensure entertainment to you and your guests

1567
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:47,120
I've got a bad feeling about this

1568
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:49,700
Could they possibly be...?

1569
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:54,390
Chiaki

1570
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:57,000
I'm pretty sure who this is then

1571
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:01,130
Natsumi

1572
01:24:02,490 --> 01:24:03,120
Incredible

1573
01:24:04,950 --> 01:24:06,620
What is this ?

1574
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:09,090
I wouldn't call this an adequate entertainment

1575
01:24:11,050 --> 01:24:13,850
What a crappy quality of performance this is

1576
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:16,100
Couldn't they done a little better than this ?

1577
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:19,550
Even the wig isn't fitted right

1578
01:24:21,550 --> 01:24:22,820
Seriously

1579
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:27,910
This is not acceptable

1580
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:32,150
I have seen enough of this

1581
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:35,720
Onii, I'm wishing you luck once again this year

1582
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:36,880
Onii, I'm wishing you luck once again this year

1583
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:39,620
Puu !

1584
01:24:38,090 --> 01:24:41,180
Well, thank you very much

1585
01:24:41,510 --> 01:24:42,820
Piko-chan, I'm working hard for you, too

1586
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:45,880
Piko-chan, I'm working hard for you, too

1587
01:24:45,070 --> 01:24:46,360
Who's Piko-chan ?

1588
01:24:47,910 --> 01:24:48,750
Piko-chan ??

1589
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:50,970
What the heck is Piko-chan ?

1590
01:24:50,970 --> 01:24:54,290
Where do you get "Piko" from your name, Hamada-san ?

1591
01:24:55,420 --> 01:24:56,440
Let me explain

1592
01:24:56,710 --> 01:24:59,660
Remember, when I got married, she used to call me "Pii-chan" ??

1593
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:02,360
Well, it somehow evolved into "Piko-chan"

1594
01:25:01,010 --> 01:25:05,030
We're looking forward to serve you.

1595
01:25:06,620 --> 01:25:09,280
No, she doesn't call me that anymore

1596
01:25:09,430 --> 01:25:11,430
She just modified that old nickname of mine

1597
01:25:13,330 --> 01:25:14,570
This isn't good

1598
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:21,720
My back hurts more than anything

1599
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:23,780
We should be thankful

1600
01:25:23,780 --> 01:25:25,690
to get slapped once for that whole segment

1601
01:25:25,710 --> 01:25:26,340
Indeed

1602
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:27,450
We should've gotten at least five or six slaps

1603
01:25:27,450 --> 01:25:28,830
You know what though ?

1604
01:25:28,830 --> 01:25:32,160
At one point, I was afraid one of my family members

1605
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:33,830
would show up at this.

1606
01:25:33,830 --> 01:25:35,630
Anybody could have shown up at that footage

1607
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:38,870
She looked the part of Yakuza's wife

1608
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:46,310
Piko-chan...

1609
01:25:46,470 --> 01:25:49,600
So, this is what you'd gone through in past years

1610
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:51,110
Yes, like this

1611
01:25:52,410 --> 01:25:55,280
It's amazing that you didn't know about this

1612
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:55,740
What do you mean ?

1613
01:25:55,940 --> 01:25:56,840
You know, about this ?

1614
01:25:57,050 --> 01:25:57,980
Right, nothing

1615
01:25:59,190 --> 01:26:03,360
So it was carried out behind your back

1616
01:26:03,610 --> 01:26:06,110
How terrifying !

1617
01:26:07,930 --> 01:26:11,500
Who knows what else is planned

1618
01:26:11,830 --> 01:26:13,490
Chiaki's new husband must have

1619
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:19,720
New Onii

1620
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:16,000
hurt his elbow during the shooting

1621
01:26:16,370 --> 01:26:18,370
Maybe when he was riding that bicycle ?

1622
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:22,220
It's been 4 hours since the start

1623
01:26:22,490 --> 01:26:26,020
Time for what they've been waiting for

1624
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:28,230
Alright

1625
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:35,050
Can I get a new pair of gloves ?

1626
01:26:35,050 --> 01:26:37,020
I don't think you'll need them

1627
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:40,430
I'll need them when we have to step outside

1628
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:45,570
I brought you a lunch

1629
01:26:44,190 --> 01:26:44,950
Alright

1630
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:46,730
Seriously ?

1631
01:26:46,870 --> 01:26:50,440
Today's menu is noodles with dipping soup

1632
01:26:49,390 --> 01:26:50,050
Really ?

1633
01:26:50,050 --> 01:26:51,150
Thank you very much

1634
01:26:51,770 --> 01:26:53,570
Enjoy it

1635
01:26:53,770 --> 01:26:54,940
Wait ?

1636
01:26:55,470 --> 01:27:00,880
Dipping soups are knocked over

1637
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:57,800
Sorry, but the soups have been knocked over here

1638
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:58,650
It was an accident

1639
01:26:59,270 --> 01:27:01,220
Oh, well

1640
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:07,290
This side is OK

1641
01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:13,560
5 servings of noodles are salvaged

1642
01:27:07,670 --> 01:27:10,040
At least the noodles are intact

1643
01:27:09,470 --> 01:27:16,840
Note: Notice how the topping the right box are still in tact.

1644
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:13,010
And there's one bowl of soup left

1645
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:14,890
Here are some toppings for the noodles as well

1646
01:27:14,890 --> 01:27:16,900
You guys can share this as well

1647
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:19,330
Is this enough for all of us ?

1648
01:27:19,330 --> 01:27:21,670
Well, you've got plenty of noodles

1649
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:23,770
Who knocked them over ?

1650
01:27:23,770 --> 01:27:26,170
I knocked them over

1651
01:27:26,170 --> 01:27:27,340
I'm sorry

1652
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:29,260
I know you're sorry but

1653
01:27:29,910 --> 01:27:33,150
Well, go ahead and share these amongst yourselves

1654
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:34,180
Why share ?

1655
01:27:34,450 --> 01:27:36,750
I see that there's one for each of us

1656
01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:39,300
We got a bowl of noodles for each of us

1657
01:27:39,850 --> 01:27:42,150
Yes, we got the noodles but

1658
01:27:42,150 --> 01:27:44,720
There's not enough soup and toppings for all of us

1659
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:57,900
Boiled Eggs
x2

1660
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:57,900
Bowl of Noodles
x5

1661
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:57,900
Chashu(Roast
Pork) x2

1662
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:57,900
Dipping Soup
x1

1663
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:57,900
Food Groups

1664
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:47,480
With only one bowl of dipping soup left,

1665
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:50,100
The members have to take turns eating noodles

1666
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:55,020
Nobody touched any of the topping on the first round

1667
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:58,470
and just enjoy the noodles

1668
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:01,940
I'm not liking this "middle-aged" men festival

1669
01:28:02,170 --> 01:28:04,810
After a first round...

1670
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:05,200
First round is all you can take ?

1671
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:08,410
Why not just dump all this toppings in this soup ?

1672
01:28:10,890 --> 01:28:12,720
Ahh

1673
01:28:14,290 --> 01:28:17,190
How should we take care of this ?

1674
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:19,390
Well, anyone who wants it...

1675
01:28:19,390 --> 01:28:20,690
All of you are full, right ?

1676
01:28:20,930 --> 01:28:23,060
No way, I can still eat

1677
01:28:22,750 --> 01:28:24,030
I'm not quite done either

1678
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:26,300
Why don't we make another round ?

1679
01:28:26,530 --> 01:28:29,240
It's just not sanitary

1680
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:29,860
C'mon, it's OK

1681
01:28:31,270 --> 01:28:32,740
Then, use the butt-end of the chopsticks

1682
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:33,840
I really don't like this

1683
01:28:34,870 --> 01:28:37,840
We don't need to do that
Let's just eat like men !

1684
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:40,450
But look at us middle-aged men

1685
01:28:40,450 --> 01:28:41,410
We're too gross to eat like this

1686
01:28:41,410 --> 01:28:44,520
But you're the oldest man here

1687
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:54,600
What's wrong with just making another round ?

1688
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,940
Who wants boiled eggs ?

1689
01:29:02,470 --> 01:29:15,280
Boiled Egg x2

1690
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:04,640
I do

1691
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:05,910
I'd like one, too

1692
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:08,240
I do, too

1693
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:10,640
I don't care too much for boiled eggs

1694
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:11,290
Hamada-san ?

1695
01:29:11,910 --> 01:29:14,410
Well...

1696
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:18,050
Let's Jyanken (rock, paper, scissors) for it ?

1697
01:29:18,050 --> 01:29:19,320
Do you really want it ?

1698
01:29:18,050 --> 01:29:22,480
Jyanken = Rock, Paper, Scissors

1699
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:20,250
Boiled eggs

1700
01:29:20,250 --> 01:29:22,320
are one of my favorites

1701
01:29:24,220 --> 01:29:25,260
Let's Jyanken then

1702
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:27,860
You're in, too ??

1703
01:29:30,050 --> 01:29:30,780
What ?

1704
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:33,530
Isn't it just us three ?

1705
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:37,140
I don't see why I'm not in on this

1706
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:40,410
Who wants boiled eggs ?

1707
01:29:38,510 --> 01:29:38,870
I do

1708
01:29:38,870 --> 01:29:39,820
I do

1709
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:42,810
Let's Jyanken then

1710
01:29:42,810 --> 01:29:44,810
You're in ?

1711
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:49,820
What're you gonna do, if you beat us ?

1712
01:29:48,090 --> 01:29:50,390
Us three are going for boiled eggs

1713
01:29:52,150 --> 01:29:54,850
You just wanna participate in Jyanken ?

1714
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:58,620
I'll think about what to do if I beat all of you

1715
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:01,060
There's no guarantee that I beat you

1716
01:30:00,010 --> 01:30:01,050
You're right

1717
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,030
I don't get this

1718
01:30:15,570 --> 01:30:17,010
Why am I OUT ?

1719
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:24,500
Start the usual way ?

1720
01:30:25,190 --> 01:30:26,060
First comes the Rock Jyanken Hoi !

1721
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:27,010
First comes the Rock Jyanken Hoi !

1722
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:30,220
I beat you !

1723
01:30:32,370 --> 01:30:33,110
First comes the Rock Jyanken Hoi !

1724
01:30:33,110 --> 01:30:34,110
First comes the Rock Jyanken Hoi !

1725
01:30:34,150 --> 01:30:36,450
So me and Hamada-san get the eggs

1726
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:38,950
What ?

1727
01:30:38,950 --> 01:30:40,560
Wasn't it for one egg ?

1728
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:43,760
Shouldn't we Jyanken again for the last one ?

1729
01:30:44,090 --> 01:30:45,900
I hear you

1730
01:30:45,930 --> 01:30:46,860
Huh ?

1731
01:30:47,730 --> 01:30:49,800
Why do you make it so difficult ?

1732
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:51,630
That was just the first round

1733
01:30:51,630 --> 01:30:52,970
We need to do a separate round for each egg.

1734
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:52,970
Absolutely

1735
01:30:52,970 --> 01:30:53,970
We need to play it twice

1736
01:30:54,620 --> 01:30:55,330
Why ?

1737
01:30:55,810 --> 01:30:57,870
So Yamasaki and Hamada need to Jyanken to decide

1738
01:30:57,870 --> 01:31:00,380
Winner gets to eat ONE

1739
01:31:00,380 --> 01:31:02,880
That wasn't the plan

1740
01:31:08,150 --> 01:31:10,320
Careful dipping your chopsticks in the soup

1741
01:31:16,730 --> 01:31:19,860
Hey, those are MY freakin' gloves !

1742
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:26,540
Wait a second

1743
01:31:27,310 --> 01:31:29,510
I made an honest mistake

1744
01:31:33,710 --> 01:31:35,710
Wait, they're actually MY gloves

1745
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:43,430
You're right, they're Endo's

1746
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:45,320
They're mine

1747
01:31:56,870 --> 01:31:59,670
So, Yama-chan, you're out of this

1748
01:31:58,710 --> 01:32:00,070
Well...

1749
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:01,660
I would like to participate again

1750
01:32:01,790 --> 01:32:03,050
You want two eggs ?

1751
01:32:03,210 --> 01:32:04,010
It's not really two

1752
01:32:04,010 --> 01:32:05,310
It was one split into two, so I only had half.

1753
01:32:05,310 --> 01:32:06,930
It was one split into two, so I only had half.

1754
01:32:07,710 --> 01:32:10,210
But you already had one

1755
01:32:10,450 --> 01:32:13,150
Even a real snake wouldn't try again

1756
01:32:19,050 --> 01:32:20,590
I'd say he was laughing just now

1757
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:27,030
Alright, I'm in !!

1758
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:33,570
I got it !

1759
01:32:35,030 --> 01:32:36,190
So you WOULD eat two

1760
01:32:36,870 --> 01:32:38,210
Two of them

1761
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:48,430
What the hell ?

1762
01:32:50,330 --> 01:32:51,640
What was that ?

1763
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:54,660
What the hell's wrong with you ?

1764
01:32:54,660 --> 01:32:55,990
That is disgusting

1765
01:32:55,990 --> 01:32:58,160
What's so freakin' funny ?!

1766
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:03,850
That is gross

1767
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:06,740
How dare you spit it out

1768
01:33:10,970 --> 01:33:13,390
What's with your hysterical laugh anyhow ?

1769
01:33:14,810 --> 01:33:16,410
How freakin' good are you at Jyanken?

1770
01:33:16,450 --> 01:33:17,200
Yeah, I know

1771
01:33:19,180 --> 01:33:21,680
No, you guys just suck at it

1772
01:33:21,690 --> 01:33:24,190
I was surprised that I beat you

1773
01:33:25,980 --> 01:33:27,060
Ok, should we move onto the Chashu (roast pork) ??

1774
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:28,460
Ok, should we move onto the Chashu (roast pork) ??

1775
01:33:28,460 --> 01:33:29,700
I want it

1776
01:33:28,460 --> 01:33:41,070
Chashu (roast pork) x2

1777
01:33:31,700 --> 01:33:32,450
What ?

1778
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:35,500
How many are there ?

1779
01:33:34,110 --> 01:33:35,200
Let me count them

1780
01:33:36,150 --> 01:33:37,610
Use the butt-end of the sticks, OK ?

1781
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:38,370
Two...

1782
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:40,960
We have two slices

1783
01:33:39,990 --> 01:33:40,840
We got two

1784
01:33:41,300 --> 01:33:43,910
Can we add "Up, Down, Left, Right" also ?

1785
01:33:43,910 --> 01:33:46,940
We can't do that with more than two people

1786
01:33:43,910 --> 01:33:47,910
See www.shibatabread.com for the explanation of "Up, Down, Left, Right"

1787
01:33:45,950 --> 01:33:46,950
I think we can

1788
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:48,480
Let's try it

1789
01:33:48,590 --> 01:33:49,850
All of us ?

1790
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:55,180
So whoever wins confronts the losers

1791
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:55,720
I see

1792
01:33:56,190 --> 01:33:57,370
OK

1793
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:02,490
So the game doesn't stop until there's a winner ?

1794
01:34:02,490 --> 01:34:05,230
And the winner quickly picks one of the losers

1795
01:34:06,460 --> 01:34:07,800
I'm not getting it

1796
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:08,450
First we do Jyanken

1797
01:34:08,450 --> 01:34:11,440
and if I win, I just pick one of you
to point at

1798
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:12,510
So you pick anybody?

1799
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:19,580
Why aren't you in it ?

1800
01:34:19,740 --> 01:34:21,910
Well, I just lost

1801
01:34:26,090 --> 01:34:27,220
So you just lost ?

1802
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:28,980
You lost to all of us ?!

1803
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:31,040
You all just beat me

1804
01:34:31,050 --> 01:34:33,860
I don't think you lost

1805
01:34:32,210 --> 01:34:33,860
Really ?

1806
01:34:33,870 --> 01:34:35,710
I don't believe you can lose to all of us that easily

1807
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:38,700
since there's five of us

1808
01:34:37,810 --> 01:34:38,710
You're right

1809
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:41,060
So ONE guy has to beat the rest ?

1810
01:34:41,060 --> 01:34:43,270
That would take some endurance

1811
01:34:43,470 --> 01:34:44,410
How about this then ?

1812
01:34:44,490 --> 01:34:47,480
Just have whoever wins point at the losers

1813
01:34:47,620 --> 01:34:49,240
regardless of the number of winners

1814
01:34:49,610 --> 01:34:50,410
For instance,

1815
01:34:50,420 --> 01:34:51,790
If Tanaka and I win

1816
01:34:52,230 --> 01:34:53,760
then he and I would point at you

1817
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:55,180
So multiple people can win

1818
01:34:55,580 --> 01:34:58,180
If three of us win, then three of us will point at the loser ?

1819
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:03,400
How would the loser play when he's got
fingers coming from all over the place ?

1820
01:35:04,180 --> 01:35:06,880
So if the loser looks in the finger's directoin,

1821
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:08,480
then you lose

1822
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:10,140
And if you don't

1823
01:35:08,590 --> 01:35:10,140
you're safe

1824
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:21,780
You just confused the hell out of us

1825
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:24,080
Why not just ONE winner

1826
01:35:26,140 --> 01:35:29,000
If four of us win,

1827
01:35:29,220 --> 01:35:31,570
then one loser gets picked by the rest of us

1828
01:35:32,050 --> 01:35:33,750
Well, let's go back to the ONE winner system

1829
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:38,190
But how long will it take to get just ONE winner ?

1830
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:39,620
Let's just do it once

1831
01:35:38,190 --> 01:35:39,620
Let's try it

1832
01:36:03,310 --> 01:36:04,310
Amazing

1833
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:06,820
That was miraculous

1834
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:10,320
Who would have thought it'd be this easy ??

1835
01:36:10,810 --> 01:36:12,470
It's been 4 and a half hours

1836
01:36:13,030 --> 01:36:17,040
After a lively lunch, a visitor arrives

1837
01:36:17,590 --> 01:36:18,090
Thank you

1838
01:36:18,090 --> 01:36:20,460
Thank you

1839
01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:22,830
Thank you very much

1840
01:36:22,830 --> 01:36:26,470
So you guys are the newly hired Hotel Employees

1841
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:27,140
Huh ?

1842
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:31,310
I'm in charge of all the in-house entertainment

1843
01:36:29,270 --> 01:36:33,480
Guest Entertainment Manager

Haruna Kondo

1844
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:33,250
My name is Haruna Kondo

1845
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:34,670
Nice to meet you all

1846
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:36,700
You, too

1847
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:39,780
We have our own resident entertainers

1848
01:36:39,780 --> 01:36:42,350
here at our hotel

1849
01:36:43,090 --> 01:36:46,360
And Mr. Fujiwara has asked me to introduce

1850
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:48,960
some of our resident entertainers to you guys

1851
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:53,930
Resident Entertainer Show

1852
01:36:49,770 --> 01:36:51,860
Here's our first act

1853
01:36:52,020 --> 01:36:53,120
C'mon out !

1854
01:36:57,320 --> 01:36:58,770
Alright

1855
01:37:02,810 --> 01:37:03,940
I'm Ken-chan

1856
01:37:03,940 --> 01:37:04,910
I'm Ban-chan

1857
01:37:04,910 --> 01:37:05,910
I'm Mah-kun !

1858
01:37:06,010 --> 01:37:07,110
And we are

1859
01:37:08,170 --> 01:37:14,060
*The term "Battery" means a
pitcher and catcher pair in Japanese baseball

1860
01:37:08,610 --> 01:37:09,760
BATTERIES

1861
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:14,140
As usual, we're ready to hit some home runs

1862
01:37:14,140 --> 01:37:16,020
Yeah, ones that go over the stadium !

1863
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:17,550
Mah-kun, are you ready to hit a big one ?

1864
01:37:18,250 --> 01:37:19,490
Well, since I'm a pitcher

1865
01:37:20,090 --> 01:37:22,260
I'm not great at hitting home runs

1866
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,080
Why're you so stiff ?

1867
01:37:22,430 --> 01:37:23,790
Just go with the flow

1868
01:37:23,790 --> 01:37:25,130
and say you're ready to hit some

1869
01:37:25,310 --> 01:37:25,960
Indeed

1870
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:28,270
Let's try this again

1871
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:31,100
My league has a DH

1872
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:33,370
thus, as a pitcher, I don't get to hit

1873
01:37:32,220 --> 01:37:33,640
Right, no time to practice hittin'

1874
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:35,100
Why so stiff ??

1875
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:36,660
Just pretend you're a hitter, too

1876
01:37:37,710 --> 01:37:41,380
Mah-kun, I couldn't agree with you more

1877
01:37:40,570 --> 01:37:41,390
Really ?

1878
01:37:41,390 --> 01:37:42,060
What did he say ?

1879
01:37:42,810 --> 01:37:44,480
Um, I forgot

1880
01:37:43,330 --> 01:37:44,490
What ? You forgot ??

1881
01:37:45,650 --> 01:37:47,740
We're BATTERIES !!

1882
01:37:50,980 --> 01:37:53,120
Anyway, let me point out how fit you are

1883
01:37:53,290 --> 01:37:54,590
This is aweful

1884
01:37:54,590 --> 01:37:55,290
Really awful

1885
01:37:55,290 --> 01:37:56,510
How tall are you ?

1886
01:37:56,490 --> 01:37:57,340
186cm

1887
01:37:57,470 --> 01:37:58,800
186cm ?

1888
01:37:58,830 --> 01:38:00,770
You can remember it as

1889
01:38:01,030 --> 01:38:03,330
ee (one) hah (eight) ro (six)

1890
01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:04,300
How much do you weigh then ?

1891
01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:04,830
90kg

1892
01:38:04,860 --> 01:38:05,830
How about

1893
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:07,970
ku (nine) re (zero) ??

1894
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:09,220
And your birthday ?

1895
01:38:09,220 --> 01:38:11,440
November 1st, 1988

1896
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:13,950
ii (one) ku (nine) ha(eight) ha(eight) ii(one) ii(one) ii(one)

1897
01:38:13,950 --> 01:38:15,920
What are you doing with these numbers anyhow ?

1898
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:17,680
What do you get out of that ?

1899
01:38:18,750 --> 01:38:21,080
I forgot

1900
01:38:19,630 --> 01:38:20,710
You forgot ?

1901
01:38:21,080 --> 01:38:22,780
Don't improvise

1902
01:38:24,810 --> 01:38:27,020
What's your uniform number ?

1903
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:29,520
It's ii(one) ha(eight)

1904
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,520
You're in on this, too ??

1905
01:38:29,730 --> 01:38:31,070
We're "Batteries"

1906
01:38:32,410 --> 01:38:34,260
Let's keep this momentum going

1907
01:38:34,820 --> 01:38:35,490
Yeah, let's go

1908
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:42,800
Look, they're ALL nervous

1909
01:38:43,550 --> 01:38:44,590
Let's reenact a post-game interview

1910
01:38:44,590 --> 01:38:46,050
You know I can always talk up a storm

1911
01:38:46,050 --> 01:38:47,530
even during my professional career

1912
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:48,840
Yes, you're very good at it

1913
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:51,110
Why don't you teach this youngster a thing or two

1914
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:52,700
about being a star athlete

1915
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:56,740
I'm here with the winning pitcher,Tanaka

1916
01:38:56,760 --> 01:38:58,690
Congratulations

1917
01:39:00,070 --> 01:39:01,510
You threw very well today

1918
01:39:03,830 --> 01:39:05,910
How were you able to salvage your 9th inning ?

1919
01:39:05,990 --> 01:39:08,500
I'm very sorry

1920
01:39:07,070 --> 01:39:09,510
Why are you sorry ?

1921
01:39:10,100 --> 01:39:12,430
Customers were getting food poisoning

1922
01:39:12,430 --> 01:39:14,740
at one of my restaurants

1923
01:39:12,790 --> 01:39:14,700
Wait, you're talking about ME !!??

1924
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:17,840
We're "Batteries"

1925
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:19,950
Thank you very much

1926
01:39:23,750 --> 01:39:25,150
I'm fine with being OUT

1927
01:39:25,150 --> 01:39:26,880
but I felt bad for Mah-kun

1928
01:39:27,350 --> 01:39:29,580
I never dreamed of having Mah-kun out here

1929
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:34,210
That was pretty cool

1930
01:39:34,430 --> 01:39:35,430
Amazing

1931
01:39:36,260 --> 01:39:38,640
I don't think they were that funny

1932
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:40,600
They were too much

1933
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:42,090
Hilarious

1934
01:39:42,130 --> 01:39:43,970
Their comedy just kills it

1935
01:39:44,130 --> 01:39:45,670
What a weird bunch

1936
01:39:45,670 --> 01:39:47,470
But very funny indeed

1937
01:39:47,970 --> 01:39:49,940
Well, I didn't think so

1938
01:39:49,940 --> 01:39:51,310
But there's more

1939
01:39:51,780 --> 01:39:53,140
We've had enough already

1940
01:39:53,210 --> 01:39:56,680
Here's some yonng talents, moving up the ladder

1941
01:39:56,680 --> 01:39:58,810
C'mon out !

1942
01:39:59,890 --> 01:40:01,680
This music is really annoying

1943
01:40:02,610 --> 01:40:03,550
Hello

1944
01:40:03,550 --> 01:40:05,170
And thank you

1945
01:40:05,170 --> 01:40:07,170
We are "Audrey"

1946
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:13,830
"Audrey"

1947
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:13,830
Masayasu Wakabayashi     Ichiro Itoh (ELT)

1948
01:40:10,150 --> 01:40:12,930
Let's get this show started with a bang

1949
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:16,600
Tooosu !

1950
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:19,940
That was the least audible "Tooosu !" ever

1951
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:21,230
Kasuga ! Kasuga !

1952
01:40:21,230 --> 01:40:21,870
Kasuga ! Kasuga !

1953
01:40:22,070 --> 01:40:24,630
Again, you could hardly hear him but...

1954
01:40:24,010 --> 01:40:25,010
I don't think they can hear you in a back

1955
01:40:25,260 --> 01:40:27,250
Let's get the show started

1956
01:40:25,410 --> 01:40:27,880
I can barely make out what he's saying

1957
01:40:28,010 --> 01:40:29,080
Damn you !!

1958
01:40:29,380 --> 01:40:31,220
Don't worry.

1959
01:40:31,470 --> 01:40:33,970
I, Kasuga, will never hit on any fans

1960
01:40:33,970 --> 01:40:35,880
Well, you have no fans anyhow

1961
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:38,420
His voice is so freakin' low

1962
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:39,800
So I was thinking of maybe moving

1963
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:40,510
What ?

1964
01:40:40,630 --> 01:40:42,530
Don't be the one wanting to move

1965
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:46,540
The reason I want to move is

1966
01:40:45,730 --> 01:40:48,260
I can't hear him at all

1967
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:49,020
because my house is so old that...

1968
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:53,340
My house is falling apart and...

1969
01:40:57,270 --> 01:40:59,840
Because the house is so old that I can't invite...

1970
01:41:01,350 --> 01:41:02,480
Who the hell are you talking to ?

1971
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:03,960
My audience, of course

1972
01:41:06,980 --> 01:41:09,850
C'mon, get this right !

1973
01:41:08,940 --> 01:41:14,090
So the house is too old to stay there any longer...

1974
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:15,110
Then stay out of Japan

1975
01:41:15,110 --> 01:41:16,930
You stay out off the earth, moron !

1976
01:41:16,930 --> 01:41:20,430
As I said, I need to find a new house

1977
01:41:20,430 --> 01:41:22,160
So we can happily live together

1978
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:22,850
Get outta here !

1979
01:41:22,850 --> 01:41:24,890
I can't talk to you anymore

1980
01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:26,910
Are you serious ?

1981
01:41:26,910 --> 01:41:28,100
If I were serious,

1982
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:30,120
we wouldn't be here together right now

1983
01:41:36,550 --> 01:41:37,940
That was totally uncalled for

1984
01:41:38,030 --> 01:41:39,960
Thank you very much

1985
01:41:42,450 --> 01:41:44,290
Damn it !

1986
01:41:45,370 --> 01:41:47,300
What's with his voice ?

1987
01:41:54,230 --> 01:41:57,030
That was way too funny

1988
01:41:57,030 --> 01:41:58,780
Let's bring out the next act

1989
01:41:59,340 --> 01:41:59,930
Ready ?

1990
01:41:59,930 --> 01:42:01,680
Whenever you're ready !

1991
01:42:06,010 --> 01:42:07,810
I'm here !

1992
01:42:08,050 --> 01:42:13,550
For the past 50 years, I've wanted to be the next teen-idol.

1993
01:42:10,250 --> 01:42:13,780
Tama-ottei
Tamao Nakamura

1994
01:42:14,150 --> 01:42:14,880
The other day,

1995
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:16,120
I was walking downtown

1996
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:17,120
This lady came up to me and said

1997
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:19,920
"You're in that period-drama !"

1998
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:22,660
But she must've been talking about someone else

1999
01:42:22,660 --> 01:42:24,490
But don't sweat the small things

2000
01:42:24,490 --> 01:42:25,890
Tama-chiko Tama-chiko

2001
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:29,200
When I was at the beauty parlor the other day

2002
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:30,600
The stylist said to me,

2003
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:32,170
"Tamao-san, you're still so young and beautiful"

2004
01:42:32,170 --> 01:42:34,840
"Nobody would ever think you're in your 80's"

2005
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:37,710
Well, I'm still in my 70's

2006
01:42:37,710 --> 01:42:39,440
Don't sweat the small things

2007
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:41,380
Tama-chiko Tama-chiko

2008
01:42:41,380 --> 01:42:43,880
I'm finished

2009
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:55,590
Why do you get slapped ?

2010
01:42:55,770 --> 01:42:58,020
That was indeed hilarious

2011
01:42:58,360 --> 01:43:00,230
Thank you very much

2012
01:43:00,230 --> 01:43:02,700
Good bye

2013
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:02,710
Good bye

2014
01:43:04,790 --> 01:43:06,430
Damn...

2015
01:43:09,940 --> 01:43:11,840
How cool to see Mah-kun here

2016
01:43:12,170 --> 01:43:12,990
Really

2017
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:17,180
All of them were awkward

2018
01:43:21,780 --> 01:43:25,720
This is a pay-per-view channel provided by Gasu Princess Hotel

2019
01:43:25,830 --> 01:43:26,610
Hello everybody

2020
01:43:26,650 --> 01:43:28,560
We're the MC's for "Po Channel"

2021
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:33,360
License
Kazuhiro Fujiwara   Takafumi Inomoto

2022
01:43:29,310 --> 01:43:31,770
How's everyone doing ?

2023
01:43:33,700 --> 01:43:37,870
As you work as a hotel men for the next 24 hours,

2024
01:43:37,870 --> 01:43:42,940
we have Heipo-san over in that shack by the woods

2025
01:43:42,940 --> 01:43:43,910
Yes, he's alone

2026
01:43:43,910 --> 01:43:46,680
and will spend the next 24 hours in that shack

2027
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:50,780
And we will be checking on him from time to time

2028
01:43:50,780 --> 01:43:51,450
So this is live

2029
01:43:51,820 --> 01:43:53,250
It's in real time

2030
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:55,750
Yes, we're broadcasting live

2031
01:43:55,750 --> 01:43:58,790
Let us see how Heipo-san is doing at this moment

2032
01:43:59,050 --> 01:44:14,900
Pay per view channel showing Heipo's experience

2033
01:44:05,090 --> 01:44:06,130
What do I do now ?

2034
01:44:07,130 --> 01:44:10,540
Since he still has daylight,

2035
01:44:10,540 --> 01:44:13,910
he appears to still be ok.

2036
01:44:14,970 --> 01:44:16,390
So,

2037
01:44:17,230 --> 01:44:19,890
we're going to shut off all the lights

2038
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:20,690
Right now ?

2039
01:44:20,690 --> 01:44:21,930
Yes, right now

2040
01:44:23,210 --> 01:44:25,850
Go ahead and proceed

2041
01:44:24,900 --> 01:44:26,630
This isn't cool

2042
01:44:31,150 --> 01:44:33,520
That scared the heck outta me

2043
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:34,030
What    what   what ?!

2044
01:44:34,030 --> 01:44:34,480
What    what   what ?!

2045
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:35,490
What    what   what ?!

2046
01:44:35,490 --> 01:44:39,160
Oh, nooooo

2047
01:44:42,060 --> 01:44:44,900
What's going on here ?

2048
01:44:48,950 --> 01:44:49,510
Hey ?

2049
01:44:49,510 --> 01:44:52,410
Could you guys cut me some slack ?

2050
01:44:52,410 --> 01:44:54,870
Seriously, don't let him talk

2051
01:44:58,310 --> 01:45:00,780
I'm scared

2052
01:45:03,220 --> 01:45:04,960
We'll be interrupting you guys to show

2053
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:06,490
how Heipo-san is doing from time to time

2054
01:45:06,490 --> 01:45:08,060
We're looking forward to it as well

2055
01:45:08,060 --> 01:45:09,280
No, no more

2056
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:11,560
You don't need to do this anymore

2057
01:45:11,740 --> 01:45:12,690
How annoying

2058
01:45:12,690 --> 01:45:16,200
They can definitely get us OUT every time

2059
01:45:16,870 --> 01:45:18,730
I see Heipo's got the short end of the stick, too

2060
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:19,730
He could go crazy in there

2061
01:45:19,830 --> 01:45:21,030
Yeah, he could

2062
01:45:21,770 --> 01:45:24,510
He'll start saying weird stuff

2063
01:45:25,340 --> 01:45:27,810
He was already like, "What, what ??"

2064
01:45:28,410 --> 01:45:30,230
It's been 5 and a half hours

2065
01:45:30,250 --> 01:45:33,390
A gourmet event for a gourmet hotel

2066
01:45:36,120 --> 01:45:38,220
Listen up, guys

2067
01:45:38,650 --> 01:45:42,020
Critics from the Michelin Guide are here

2068
01:45:42,020 --> 01:45:44,990
to see how this hotel fares against other top hotels.

2069
01:45:45,260 --> 01:45:46,830
Shall we go observe them ?

2070
01:45:47,230 --> 01:45:52,570
Observation of the Michelin Guide Critics

2071
01:45:48,180 --> 01:45:50,290
We'll be transferring to the Main Building

2072
01:45:53,300 --> 01:45:57,140
Fujiwara kept my gloves super warm

2073
01:45:58,970 --> 01:46:03,510
Are we hopping onto a bus again ?

2074
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:04,610
This way

2075
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:06,160
What ?

2076
01:46:07,060 --> 01:46:08,520
Since this is a massive resort,

2077
01:46:08,510 --> 01:46:10,490
we're biking to the main building.

2078
01:46:09,720 --> 01:46:14,220
Bike to the Main Building

2079
01:46:10,770 --> 01:46:13,720
Man, it'll be a cold ride

2080
01:46:14,220 --> 01:46:17,460
Pick the bike with your name on it

2081
01:46:18,860 --> 01:46:21,300
Why do I get THIS one ?

2082
01:46:21,300 --> 01:46:25,870
Yamasaki has a baby seat in the back

2083
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:24,400
It'll be cold

2084
01:46:25,020 --> 01:46:25,890
Let's get going

2085
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:29,440
Hey, you guys all have electronic bikes

2086
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:31,870
Electronic-assisting ?

2087
01:46:30,370 --> 01:46:33,380
Don't forget to turn your electronics on

2088
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:36,610
I don't have that feature

2089
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:40,650
Give me a break

2090
01:46:40,650 --> 01:46:42,950
Mine's just a regular bike

2091
01:46:44,350 --> 01:46:44,550
Wait !

2092
01:46:44,550 --> 01:46:47,190
Wait up ! Wait up ! Wait up ! Wait up !

2093
01:46:47,190 --> 01:46:48,230

01:46:48,300 --> 01:46:49,780
Wait for me !

2095
01:46:51,890 --> 01:46:53,500
What're you doing, Hosei-san ?

2096
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:54,140
Turn left here

2097
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:57,470
Wait up ! Damn it...

2098
01:46:57,470 --> 01:46:59,730
This sucks hard

2099
01:46:59,740 --> 01:47:02,020
Let't get up this hill

2100
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:05,590
Wow, the electronics make it really easy to pedal

2101
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:08,510
Follow me

2102
01:47:08,710 --> 01:47:11,310
Wait for me

2103
01:47:11,310 --> 01:47:12,950
C'mon, Hosei-san

2104
01:47:12,950 --> 01:47:14,780
I can't make it up the hill

2105
01:47:15,540 --> 01:47:16,120
Seriously

2106
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:17,790
Wow, this is pretty cool

2107
01:47:18,030 --> 01:47:20,110
Pedaling is a piece of cake

2108
01:47:18,570 --> 01:47:23,120
*Permission obtained to shoot on this road

2109
01:47:20,190 --> 01:47:21,280
Wait for me !

2110
01:47:21,310 --> 01:47:22,590
Wait, everyone !

2111
01:47:23,220 --> 01:47:23,960

2114
01:47:26,260 --> 01:47:27,200
Hey !

2115
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:28,530
I'm not kiddin'

2116
01:47:28,530 --> 01:47:29,600
Wait up !

2117
01:47:29,830 --> 01:47:34,500
First outside activity
A Brief Refreshing Time !!

2118
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:40,870
But don't forget you're still in Suga Puri territory

2119
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:41,540
There's no time for any breathers

2120
01:47:44,410 --> 01:47:47,280
It's quite a ways to the main building

2121
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:47,640
Yes, this is a big place

2122
01:47:51,320 --> 01:47:55,620
Itsuji Itao

2123
01:47:55,640 --> 01:47:57,260

2124
01:48:08,900 --> 01:48:10,870

2125
01:48:09,630 --> 01:48:10,870

2126
01:48:28,190 --> 01:48:29,360

How funny

2130
01:48:42,700 --> 01:48:44,520
I've heard he can ride horses but...

2131
01:48:45,740 --> 01:48:47,400
It hurts more out here

2132
01:48:54,150 --> 01:48:57,250
The horse was really neighing, right ?

2133
01:48:56,610 --> 01:48:57,210
Yes, it was

2134
01:48:57,740 --> 01:48:58,820
Amazing

2135
01:48:59,890 --> 01:49:02,660
That timing couldn't have been more perfect

2136
01:49:03,190 --> 01:49:04,330
He's a good rider

2137
01:49:04,330 --> 01:49:06,760
We're almost there

2142
01:49:18,990 --> 01:49:21,270
It is indeed cold

2143
01:49:22,780 --> 01:49:23,710
Why are we...?

2144
01:49:23,780 --> 01:49:26,580

01:54:28,630 --> 01:54:29,880
Let's keep going

2226
01:54:31,650 --> 01:54:35,140
Fish

2227
01:54:37,710 --> 01:54:39,140
He's not taking this seriously

2228
01:54:49,060 --> 01:54:52,480
Sweet Potato Chips

2229
01:54:55,250 --> 01:54:57,220
You know, that's already the brand name of a snack

2230
01:54:59,730 --> 01:55:02,200
You know that's already sold in stores...

2231
01:55:06,650 --> 01:55:08,410
Seriously, it's already being sold

2232
01:55:08,410 --> 01:55:10,130
We eat them as snacks

2233
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,770
Will you shut the hell up, please ?

2234
01:55:14,490 --> 01:55:15,820
Please

2235
01:55:16,360 --> 01:55:17,660
Your laugh is contagious

2236
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:21,550
Proceed

Method to Kill a Swallow

2240
01:55:33,210 --> 01:55:34,770
Anything goes at this point

2241
01:55:38,460 --> 01:55:39,960
Nobody is following the rules

2242
01:55:42,310 --> 01:55:44,270
Why would you use the
word " Kill " ??

2243
01:55:44,670 --> 01:55:46,040
May I criticize ?

2244
01:55:46,040 --> 01:55:47,470
Nobody is following the rules

2245
01:55:47,470 --> 01:55:49,740
Next category

2246
01:55:53,100 --> 01:55:56,080
As a Hotel Man, more often than not
you will find yourself having to

2247
01:55:56,080 --> 01:55:58,490
gracefully move from point A to point B

2248
01:55:58,510 --> 01:56:00,310
With that, I introduce...

2249
01:56:00,940 --> 01:56:06,020
Dance humorously to the assigned music

2250
01:56:00,940 --> 01:56:06,020
Humor Dancing

2251
01:56:06,070 --> 01:56:07,930
Let us begin

2252
01:56:25,820 --> 01:56:27,980
He plays dirty

2253
01:56:29,780 --> 01:56:31,760
Look, he dropped his hat on purpose

2254
01:56:30,330 --> 01:56:35,060
*Cast members have laughed but enjoy the segment without interruption

2255
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:34,160
He did that for the effect

2256
01:57:03,780 --> 01:57:06,020
This is taking too long

2257
01:57:17,910 --> 01:57:19,660
She's so helplessly dumb

2258
01:57:33,780 --> 01:57:35,000
What's he doing ?

2259
01:57:45,720 --> 01:57:46,890
Ding

2260
01:58:09,680 --> 01:58:10,870
How sad was that ?

2261
01:58:10,870 --> 01:58:12,360
Why were you staring at me like that ?

2262
01:58:12,410 --> 01:58:13,780
You had no sympathy for me

2263
01:58:13,780 --> 01:58:15,930
Yamasaki got no laughs from us

2264
01:58:19,510 --> 01:58:20,460
Let's move on

2265
01:58:25,930 --> 01:58:28,730
As a Hotel Man, you have to be available

2266
01:58:28,730 --> 01:58:30,840
for your customer's needs at all times

2267

Shigeo Nagashima were a Hotel Man ?

2275
01:59:05,470 --> 01:59:07,940
Like I said...

2276
01:59:08,440 --> 01:59:10,810
Like I said...

2277
01:59:11,510 --> 01:59:13,640
It's known as Hotel...

2278
01:59:13,640 --> 01:59:15,750
It's known as Hotel...

2279
01:59:15,750 --> 01:59:16,850
How may I help you ??

2280
01:59:16,850 --> 01:59:17,920
Like I said

2281
01:59:25,220 --> 01:59:26,850
Damn it

2282
01:59:26,850 --> 01:59:29,420
He sounds more like former Prime Minister

2283
01:59:30,840 --> 01:59:32,960
Former Prime Minister, Kakuei Tanaka

2284
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:34,320
He's supposed to be Shigeo Nagashima

2285
01:59:34,520 --> 01:59:35,470
Thank you very much

02:01:16,760 --> 02:01:17,720
What ??

2323
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:20,770
What if "Demon Kogure" were a Hotel Man ?

2324
02:01:20,770 --> 02:01:23,770
What if "Demon Kogure" were a Hotel Man ?

2325
02:01:30,250 --> 02:01:33,450
Welcome to my hotel

2326
02:01:36,490 --> 02:01:37,970
Shall I turn you into customers ?

02:02:07,900 --> 02:02:11,450
If was almost as if the real people were here

2331
02:02:14,530 --> 02:02:16,890
Let's move on to the next contestant

2332
02:02:17,110 --> 02:02:18,550

First topic

2339
02:02:32,740 --> 02:02:34,110
What if "Antonio Inoki" were a Hotel Man ?

02:02:34,110 --> 02:02:37,450
What if "Antonio Inoki" were a Hotel Man ?

2341
02:02:41,650 --> 02:02:43,720

Then, LET'S GO !!!!

2345
02:02:55,180 --> 02:02:57,070
This is way too terrible

2346
02:02:57,070 --> 02:02:58,120
What's this all about ?

2347
02:03:02,340 --> 02:03:03,820
My butt has just about had it

2348
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:04,940
Let us proceed

2349
02:03:04,940 --> 02:03:06,180
Why "Let's go !" ??

2350
02:03:06,180 --> 02:03:07,880
What if "Eikichi Yazawa" were a Hotel Man ?

2351
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:11,150
What if "Eikichi Yazawa" were a Hotel Man ?

2352
02:03:16,590 --> 02:03:17,620
Welcome

2353
02:03:19,010 --> 02:03:23,430
Sometimes, it's refreshing for a woman to travel alone

2354
02:03:32,320 --> 02:03:33,520
What is this ?

2355
02:03:35,670 --> 02:03:37,620
He's completely ignoring the rules

2356
02:03:36,440 --> 02:03:37,560
Here's another one

2357
02:03:38,980 --> 02:03:40,680
What if "Paris Hilton" were a Hotel Woman ?

2358
02:03:40,680 --> 02:03:43,650
What if "Paris Hilton" were a Hotel Woman ?

2359
02:03:49,950 --> 02:03:51,760
Hello

2360
02:03:51,760 --> 02:03:52,620
Did you have a

2361
02:03:52,620 --> 02:03:55,190
Did you have a reservation ?

2362
02:03:55,190 --> 02:03:57,230
What's your name ?

2363
02:03:57,230 --> 02:03:59,860
This is wa

2364
02:04:01,060 --> 02:04:03,070
"Where're you going ?"

2365
02:04:03,070 --> 02:04:06,270
Where are you going to with Tokyo ?

2366
02:04:12,310 --> 02:04:13,180
Incredible

2367
02:04:16,980 --> 02:04:19,750
What's with this format ?

2368
02:04:23,020 --> 02:04:25,920
I asked where you wanted to go

2369
02:04:25,920 --> 02:04:27,620
You said you've never been to Tokyo Tower

2370
02:04:27,620 --> 02:04:31,160
So, I asked if you wanted me to guide you there

2371
02:04:33,560 --> 02:04:35,930
Tokyo is quite a big city

2372
02:04:35,930 --> 02:04:37,700
And I don't know where I should take you to but...

2373
02:04:43,980 --> 02:04:45,430
What is he doing here ?

2374
02:04:47,430 --> 02:04:49,520
Where's Paris Hilton in this ?

2375
02:04:53,850 --> 02:04:55,820
Finished ?

2376
02:04:56,010 --> 02:04:56,800
Are you still good ?

2377
02:05:00,660 --> 02:05:03,530
I don't really know who she is so...

2378
02:05:03,530 --> 02:05:04,930
I couldn't impersonate her

2379
02:05:04,930 --> 02:05:07,460
but I thought it'd be a good idea

2380
02:05:07,460 --> 02:05:09,570
if I threw in some English

2381
02:05:20,850 --> 02:05:23,650
This is amazing, isn't it ?

2382
02:05:24,360 --> 02:05:26,080
New Onii is too awesome

2383
02:05:26,080 --> 02:05:28,090
New Onii owns this

2384
02:05:32,090 --> 02:05:33,040
Thank you very much

2385
02:05:33,190 --> 02:05:35,180

Next up

2387
02:05:41,100 --> 02:05:46,340
As a Hotel Man, you might have to be an actor

2388
02:05:47,240 --> 02:05:54,980
Given a topic, all seven contestants
have to improvise to create a story

2389

Humorous Big Drama

Please gather at the center of the stage

Big Drama Pointer

2392
02:06:00,180 --> 02:06:11,530
It's important to take on a specific role
so the story can be built around it

2393
02:06:08,970 --> 02:06:12,370
I'm expecting to see lots of creative characters

2394
02:06:12,970 --> 02:06:14,630
Let us begin

2395
02:06:14,720 --> 02:06:15,870
Here's the topic

2396
02:06:16,900 --> 02:06:19,670

No~~~!!

2400
02:06:36,220 --> 02:06:38,290
Looks like a murder

2401
02:06:39,260 --> 02:06:41,260
We need to call the police

2402
02:06:43,530 --> 02:06:44,960
What's going on here ?

2403
02:06:44,630 --> 02:06:46,660
I'm a police officer

2404
02:06:46,660 --> 02:06:48,000
What happened here ?

2405
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,330
This man is down

2406
02:06:49,330 --> 02:06:50,230

Did you see what happened ?

2409
02:06:54,120 --> 02:06:55,310
No, I didn't

2410
02:06:55,310 --> 02:06:56,410
No, but I was informed of it

2411
02:06:56,410 --> 02:06:57,770
Who are you then ?

2412
02:06:57,770 --> 02:06:58,740
I'm just a Hotel Man

2413
02:07:01,620 --> 02:07:03,020
And what time did this happen ?

2414
02:07:02,210 --> 02:07:05,980
Yama-chan was wise to pick that role

2415
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:03,970
About two hours ago

2416
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:04,920
I see, two hours ago

2417
02:07:05,980 --> 02:07:08,950
Yama-chan is playing very cowardly

2418
02:07:08,950 --> 02:07:11,120
How do you know him ?

2419
02:07:11,120 --> 02:07:13,220
I'm his daughter

2420
02:07:14,460 --> 02:07:16,190
Is this a woman ?

2421
02:07:17,460 --> 02:07:18,700
No, I'm his daughter

2422
02:07:18,700 --> 02:07:20,030
So, this man is your father ?

2423
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:21,400
I got it

2424
02:07:21,800 --> 02:07:22,700
And your name ?

2425
02:07:22,830 --> 02:07:24,840
His name is Masataka

2426
02:07:25,170 --> 02:07:25,670
And your name ?

2427
02:07:26,200 --> 02:07:27,670
I'm Masako

2428
02:07:27,670 --> 02:07:28,470
And you ?

2429
02:07:29,470 --> 02:07:32,780
I'm Koichi

2430
02:07:32,780 --> 02:07:34,280
Family name ?

2431
02:07:34,280 --> 02:07:37,380
Family name is Maejiba

2432
02:07:39,220 --> 02:07:41,390
What's going on here ?

2433
02:07:41,390 --> 02:07:43,550
Please, this is a police matter

2434
02:07:43,950 --> 02:07:45,690
This is a murder scene

2435
02:07:45,690 --> 02:07:48,260
Is that right ?

2436
02:07:46,120 --> 02:07:47,620
And I'm in the middle of my investigation

2437
02:07:48,260 --> 02:07:49,090
Are you his family member ?

2438
02:07:49,090 --> 02:07:50,060
No, I'm not

2439
02:07:50,060 --> 02:07:51,190
What exactly happened here ?

2440
02:07:50,920 --> 02:07:52,060
Who are you then ?

2441
02:07:52,480 --> 02:07:54,500
Please, stay behind this barricade

2442
02:07:54,160 --> 02:07:56,900
Excuse us ?

2443
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:56,510
Yes ?

2444
02:07:56,900 --> 02:07:59,070
I had a reservation

2445
02:07:59,060 --> 02:08:00,410
You need to talk to him then

2446
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:04,470
Excuse me, but I had a reservation here

2447
02:08:03,560 --> 02:08:05,420
Could you just confirm ?

2448
02:08:04,780 --> 02:08:06,780
Your name ?

2449
02:08:06,820 --> 02:08:07,920
I'm Kosugi

2450
02:08:09,310 --> 02:08:13,320
Your reservation will be honored anytime after today so
feel free to...

2451
02:08:19,260 --> 02:08:20,930
Just incredible

2452
02:08:32,600 --> 02:08:37,040
And that should conclude today's event

2453
02:08:37,110 --> 02:08:38,510
What a relief !

2454
02:08:39,780 --> 02:08:40,730
It's been 7 hours since the start

2455
02:08:40,790 --> 02:08:42,960
After the incredible Michelin event

2456
02:08:43,220 --> 02:08:44,980
Time to head back to the Annex

2457
02:08:46,820 --> 02:08:48,620
Man, his impersonation was something else

2458
02:08:48,670 --> 02:08:49,620
Indeed

2459
02:08:50,020 --> 02:08:51,290
Ah

2460
02:08:51,290 --> 02:08:52,090
Look

2461
02:08:52,090 --> 02:08:54,990
The bike seats have been stolen

2462
02:08:54,990 --> 02:09:01,330
Bike Seats are Gone

2463
02:08:56,450 --> 02:08:57,590
What are we gonna ..?

2464
02:08:57,590 --> 02:08:58,800
Well, we can't go back by bike

2465
02:08:58,840 --> 02:09:01,380
This is criminal

2466
02:09:01,380 --> 02:09:03,730
I'm in trouble here

2467
02:09:04,330 --> 02:09:06,340
What's this ?

2468
02:09:07,870 --> 02:09:11,510
Gaki Nori     Van Arrives !!

2469
02:09:13,780 --> 02:09:16,810
Foreign Driver

2470
02:09:13,920 --> 02:09:16,160
Our bike seats are gone

2471
02:09:16,160 --> 02:09:18,920
and we have no other way of getting back

2472
02:09:18,920 --> 02:09:19,850
Can you take us ?

2473
02:09:20,220 --> 02:09:21,590
Yes !

2474
02:09:21,750 --> 02:09:24,460
Cocorico and Yamasaki sit in a back

2475
02:09:24,460 --> 02:09:27,830
And Matsumoto and Hamada can sit in front of them

2476
02:09:28,560 --> 02:09:30,430
What's this jacket ?

2477
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:33,130
We can wear it if we're cold

2478
02:09:34,270 --> 02:09:35,980
I'm thankful for this

2479
02:09:36,670 --> 02:09:38,170
Let's go

2480
02:09:38,190 --> 02:09:39,690
Thank you

2481
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:41,070
What's this ?

2482
02:09:41,070 --> 02:09:46,410
Gaki Nori   Drive off to the Annex

2483
02:09:44,100 --> 02:09:46,020
I remember Fujiwara-san showed up in this van

2484
02:09:47,280 --> 02:09:48,410
Hiro !

2485
02:09:48,410 --> 02:09:50,410
I'm puttin' some music on

2486
02:10:17,650 --> 02:10:23,450
Everything started once we met

2487
02:10:19,510 --> 02:10:23,380
Why the hell are you singing it ?

2488
02:10:23,450 --> 02:10:28,920
I know there's times we hurt each other but

2489
02:10:28,920 --> 02:10:30,690
How annoying is this ?

2490
02:10:40,580 --> 02:10:41,990
Damn it

2491
02:10:42,240 --> 02:10:43,300
There he comes

2492
02:10:43,300 --> 02:10:45,800
And we have to get off the van, don't we ?

2493
02:10:45,690 --> 02:10:46,950
Yes, we do

2494
02:10:59,780 --> 02:11:01,220
The way Fujiwara interrupted

2495
02:11:01,220 --> 02:11:03,390
was irritating as well

2496
02:11:07,130 --> 02:11:09,110
It's been 8 hours since the start

2497
02:11:09,460 --> 02:11:10,890
It is already dark out

2498
02:11:12,240 --> 02:11:16,290
The cast members take a brief break

2499
02:11:19,370 --> 02:11:21,370
How unconventional was his impersonation

2500
02:11:19,370 --> 02:11:30,750
New Onii

2501
02:11:21,370 --> 02:11:23,170
of Paris Hilton ?

2502
02:11:22,150 --> 02:11:23,950
Very innovative

2503
02:11:24,980 --> 02:11:26,840
He sounded like he knew English

2504
02:11:27,310 --> 02:11:29,210
He was telling us what he was saying in English

2505
02:11:30,750 --> 02:11:33,680
Right, he translated what he'd said in English for us

2506
02:11:33,680 --> 02:11:35,290
Then, judges were like "Keep going"

2507
02:11:35,720 --> 02:11:38,190
You could see in his expression that he was annoyed

2508
02:11:38,190 --> 02:11:41,220
He was like, "Yes, so ?"

2509
02:11:41,270 --> 02:11:43,610
And then he'd start babbling again

2510
02:11:43,930 --> 02:11:45,800
Isn't he laughing ?

2511
02:11:47,910 --> 02:11:48,750
Seriously ?

2512
02:11:52,200 --> 02:11:54,460
You were no more than an average
middle-aged man on his break

2513
02:11:56,510 --> 02:11:58,030
Damn you, New Onii

2514
02:11:58,980 --> 02:12:02,150
Has Itao-san always ridden horses ?

2515
02:12:01,250 --> 02:12:01,680
Yes

2516
02:12:02,150 --> 02:12:03,450
Out of the blue,

2517
02:12:03,450 --> 02:12:04,520
He decided to take up a horseback riding

2518
02:12:04,520 --> 02:12:07,120
I had seen a photo of it before but...

2519
02:12:07,120 --> 02:12:10,990
And the horse neighing at the perfect timing

2520
02:12:11,320 --> 02:12:14,460
That couldn't have been more perfect

2521
02:12:12,610 --> 02:12:14,510
Almost too perfect

2522
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:18,030
I seriously thought the sound was coming from some speakers

2523
02:12:18,360 --> 02:12:20,130
The horse was big, too

2524
02:12:19,160 --> 02:12:20,170
Yes, indeed

2525
02:12:20,450 --> 02:12:22,070
The horse was huge

2526
02:12:22,070 --> 02:12:24,330
I thought there were some speakers set up

2527
02:12:24,330 --> 02:12:25,440
to play the neighing sound

2528
02:12:26,200 --> 02:12:27,900
That was real neighing

2529
02:12:30,940 --> 02:12:33,940
Is a horse supposed to be that big ?

2530
02:12:34,540 --> 02:12:38,320
I thought the sound was coming out of speakers

2531
02:12:41,430 --> 02:12:42,490
There he goes

2532
02:12:45,720 --> 02:12:47,690
He's trying to hide his laugh

2533
02:12:48,150 --> 02:12:49,170
You were straight up laughing

2534
02:12:50,140 --> 02:12:51,890
Like a secret live

2535
02:12:56,530 --> 02:12:57,700
Hamada-san

2536
02:12:57,700 --> 02:13:00,200
you've been hit quite a few times this year

2537
02:13:00,270 --> 02:13:01,680
Many times

2538
02:13:00,920 --> 02:13:02,620
You've been laughing quite a bit this year

2539
02:13:04,040 --> 02:13:06,340
Did you guys see any speakers set up ?

2540
02:13:08,910 --> 02:13:09,780
Gulp

2541
02:13:17,210 --> 02:13:18,480
Why you...

2542
02:13:23,900 --> 02:13:26,220
My butt hurts...

2543
02:13:26,330 --> 02:13:29,330
I wonder what's up with Heipo-san right now..

2544
02:13:27,570 --> 02:13:28,380
Yeah

2545
02:13:28,780 --> 02:13:31,560
They've only broadcasted it once for us

2546
02:13:30,520 --> 02:13:32,720
I had forgotten about him

2547
02:13:32,420 --> 02:13:34,670
He was already terrified then

2548
02:13:35,420 --> 02:13:37,710
Should something tragic happen to him,

2549
02:13:37,710 --> 02:13:39,420
we can always edit him out of the show

2550
02:13:43,080 --> 02:13:44,610
(The judging) is very lenient

2551
02:13:45,060 --> 02:13:47,250
It was a perfect laugh

2552
02:13:47,880 --> 02:13:50,020
If it was really New Year's Day,

2553
02:13:50,020 --> 02:13:52,160
that would have marked your first laugh of the year

2554
02:13:55,020 --> 02:13:56,220
See ?

2555
02:13:59,410 --> 02:14:00,560
You wait a minute !!

2556
02:14:03,750 --> 02:14:05,710
Wasn't it just Matsumoto-san ?

2557
02:14:18,100 --> 02:14:20,170
Here it comes

2558
02:14:21,380 --> 02:14:24,020
Enjoy how Heipo has fared so far

2559
02:14:24,160 --> 02:14:26,600
Man, I don't wanna see this

2560
02:14:27,820 --> 02:14:30,030
What am I to do here ?

2561
02:14:30,030 --> 02:14:31,690
I don't wanna be here

2562
02:14:31,690 --> 02:14:33,300
I'm scared !

2563
02:14:33,600 --> 02:14:36,270
Do I have to stay in this awful place ?

2564
02:14:36,630 --> 02:14:38,300
What !?

2565
02:14:38,300 --> 02:14:39,620
What ?!

2566
02:14:40,070 --> 02:14:42,140
What's this ?!

2567
02:14:43,330 --> 02:14:44,630
There he goes

2568
02:14:47,510 --> 02:14:50,050
I'm staying here ?

2569
02:14:55,190 --> 02:14:57,250
What's with this mobile home ?

2570
02:15:02,190 --> 02:15:04,260
Seriously, this aint fair

2571
02:15:07,080 --> 02:15:09,600
They can't keep showing this to us

2572
02:15:16,970 --> 02:15:18,680
He loses his short-term memory, doesn't he ?

2573
02:15:18,680 --> 02:15:20,210
Because all of a sudden, he goes,

2574
02:15:20,210 --> 02:15:20,810
"Huh, what's this ? Where am I ?"

2575
02:15:20,810 --> 02:15:21,480
"Huh, what's this ? Where am I ?"

2576
02:15:21,480 --> 02:15:23,480
"Huh, what's this ? Where am I ?"

2577
02:15:23,480 --> 02:15:24,450
But I'd say you haven't left

2578
02:15:24,740 --> 02:15:26,550
C'mon guys,

2579
02:15:26,550 --> 02:15:28,450
I can't stay here for 24 hours

2580
02:15:29,750 --> 02:15:31,790
Let me just go home

2581
02:15:31,890 --> 02:15:33,660
You're kiddin' right ?

2582
02:15:33,660 --> 02:15:36,330
Man, I'm gettin' thirsty

2583
02:15:36,330 --> 02:15:37,790
But what ?

2584
02:15:37,790 --> 02:15:40,530
That fridge is freaky

2585
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:43,570
But I need a cold beverage

2586
02:15:51,980 --> 02:15:53,210
Huh ?

2587
02:15:53,210 --> 02:15:54,880
What ?

2588
02:15:55,810 --> 02:15:56,880
Ramune (Soda) ?

2589
02:15:58,010 --> 02:15:58,950
Freaky ! Freaky ! Freaky !

2590
02:15:58,950 --> 02:15:59,920
The fridge is freaky !

2591
02:15:59,920 --> 02:16:00,220
Eh, eh, eh

2592
02:16:00,220 --> 02:16:00,480
Eh, eh, eh

2593
02:16:00,480 --> 02:16:02,290
Eh, eh, eh

2594
02:16:06,160 --> 02:16:08,170
This isn't good

2595
02:16:08,170 --> 02:16:11,040
Seriously, let's finish this

2596
02:16:13,270 --> 02:16:15,060
I can't watch this anymore

2597
02:16:16,330 --> 02:16:18,730
Ramune (Soda)

2598
02:16:20,700 --> 02:16:22,410
It's a cap

2599
02:16:24,870 --> 02:16:26,280
What now ?

2600
02:16:26,280 --> 02:16:28,610
I have stomachache

2601
02:16:30,150 --> 02:16:32,880
Please, no more

2602
02:16:33,980 --> 02:16:34,880
Pop

2603
02:16:37,250 --> 02:16:39,520
I see it's a soda

2604
02:16:41,590 --> 02:16:43,890
Ugh, what's this ?

2605
02:16:43,890 --> 02:16:46,800
I see, it's just a soda

2606
02:16:55,540 --> 02:16:58,170
I would rather watch the whole Po Channel in one sitting

2607
02:16:58,380 --> 02:17:00,620
Yes, rather than just clips here and there

2608
02:17:01,640 --> 02:17:06,520
The clip was a summariz...ed, ed, ed  ??

2609
02:17:04,520 --> 02:17:05,210
What ?

2610
02:17:05,210 --> 02:17:06,500
What ?

2611
02:17:09,190 --> 02:17:11,690
Summarized, what ?

2612
02:17:11,940 --> 02:17:13,580
Has the sun set yet ?

2613
02:17:14,800 --> 02:17:15,650
No, I don't think so

2614
02:17:15,860 --> 02:17:17,160
It may be around 5pm right now

2615
02:17:19,560 --> 02:17:21,730
I just heard someone laughing

2616
02:17:22,470 --> 02:17:25,130
Keep your eyes on Tanaka, please

2617
02:17:26,340 --> 02:17:31,050
Here's some ideas for the Hotel Men with lots of breaks

2618
02:17:35,010 --> 02:17:36,450
Listen up, guys

2619
02:17:38,180 --> 02:17:40,480
I thought you guys could kill some time with this

2620
02:17:42,050 --> 02:17:44,850
Here is a set of celebrity photos

2621
02:17:45,150 --> 02:17:47,960
I thought you guys could play "concentration" with these

2622
02:17:48,280 --> 02:17:49,710
Concentration ?

2623
02:17:50,570 --> 02:17:52,500
We could definitely kill some time with this

2624
02:17:52,500 --> 02:17:54,960
Shouldn't we have more work to do ?

2625
02:17:56,080 --> 02:17:58,460
Have fun playing concentration

2626
02:17:59,500 --> 02:18:02,110
I suck at concentration

2627
02:18:02,230 --> 02:18:03,600
Let's Jyanken to decide the order

2628
02:18:04,690 --> 02:18:06,020
First comes the Rock, Jyanken Hoi !

2629
02:18:06,020 --> 02:18:07,050
First comes the Rock, Jyanken Hoi !

2630
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:13,050
1. Hamada 2.Yamasaki 3.Endo 4.Matsumoto 5. Tanaka

2631
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:13,050
Order

2632
02:18:10,240 --> 02:18:10,900
I'll go fifth

2633
02:18:10,900 --> 02:18:11,930
I'm fourth

2634
02:18:11,930 --> 02:18:12,650
I see

2635
02:18:13,220 --> 02:18:16,750
Hamada starts

2636
02:18:15,780 --> 02:18:17,130
I'll just pick randomly then

2637
02:18:17,900 --> 02:18:18,790
Here's one

2638
02:18:18,990 --> 02:18:33,100
Gajiro Saito

2639
02:18:26,970 --> 02:18:28,010
Who is this ?

2640
02:18:28,010 --> 02:18:29,100
This is Gajiro-san

2641
02:18:29,130 --> 02:18:30,070
Oh, yeah

2642
02:18:30,160 --> 02:18:31,050
It's him

2643
02:18:31,110 --> 02:18:32,430
I'm in bad shape

2644
02:18:32,430 --> 02:18:33,780
It helped that I didn't know who this was

2645
02:18:40,580 --> 02:18:42,680
Look how young Gajiro-san is

2646
02:18:42,680 --> 02:18:44,310
I thought it was Jimmy-san at first

2647
02:18:44,310 --> 02:18:45,880
I didn't know who this was

2648
02:18:45,880 --> 02:18:48,180
but I laughed simply at his funny face

2649
02:18:55,490 --> 02:18:57,130
There's way too many cards

2650
02:18:57,170 --> 02:18:59,640
Lots and lots of cards

2651
02:18:59,800 --> 02:19:03,030
I'll attempt to look at these as nothing more than a design

2652
02:19:03,570 --> 02:19:04,620
Here I go again

2653
02:19:06,600 --> 02:19:17,480
Yukio Hashi

2654
02:19:14,770 --> 02:19:15,790
I see, it's Mr. Hashi

2655
02:19:18,080 --> 02:19:19,650
I'm not gonna fare well with this one

2656
02:19:22,450 --> 02:19:24,350
I just forgot where the cards were

2657
02:19:24,790 --> 02:19:26,720
Who's next ?

2658
02:19:27,750 --> 02:19:28,590
Oh, it's my turn

2659
02:19:30,690 --> 02:19:34,500
Akira Nishikino

2660
02:19:34,500 --> 02:19:49,780
Akira Nishikino

2661
02:19:36,830 --> 02:19:49,820
Eisaku Ohkawa

2662
02:19:44,730 --> 02:19:45,810
Wait a second

2663
02:19:45,810 --> 02:19:46,950
This isn't fair

2664
02:19:50,180 --> 02:19:53,020
I'd laugh at all of these

2665
02:19:57,910 --> 02:19:59,200
This is a tough one

2666
02:20:00,520 --> 02:20:06,400
Eisaku Ohkawa (2)

2667
02:20:06,530 --> 02:20:12,400
Eisaku Ohkawa (2)

2668
02:20:07,500 --> 02:20:12,400
Michael Tomioka

2669
02:20:10,450 --> 02:20:12,310
There's Michael Tomioka-san

2670
02:20:12,660 --> 02:20:15,080
Let's move on

2671
02:20:18,370 --> 02:20:28,150
Peter

2672
02:20:21,030 --> 02:20:21,720
Peter

2673
02:20:28,550 --> 02:20:32,220
Why use a photo like this ?

2674
02:20:34,990 --> 02:20:36,890
How old is this photo ?

2675
02:20:37,460 --> 02:20:51,510
Peter

2676
02:20:42,970 --> 02:20:51,510
Gajiro Saito (2)

2677
02:20:48,120 --> 02:20:49,690
We've seen his photo before

2678
02:20:54,980 --> 02:20:59,250
We've seen a set of Gajiro and Eisaku

2679
02:20:57,230 --> 02:20:59,230
Where was Gajiro-san ??

2680
02:20:59,230 --> 02:21:01,830
I think it was around here

2681
02:21:04,520 --> 02:21:09,490
Antonio Inoki

2682
02:21:05,430 --> 02:21:06,200
Oh, there's Inoki-san

2683
02:21:06,240 --> 02:21:08,400
I got Antonio Inoki-san

2684
02:21:08,400 --> 02:21:09,490
First time

2685
02:21:09,490 --> 02:21:18,170
Antonio Inoki

2686
02:21:11,660 --> 02:21:18,170
Jaguar Yokota

2687
02:21:15,800 --> 02:21:18,170
I've got a set of wrestlers though

2688
02:21:18,170 --> 02:21:19,370
It was close but not close enough

2689
02:21:19,370 --> 02:21:20,700
It was close but not close enough

2690
02:21:21,500 --> 02:21:22,940
I've got Gajiro-san then

2691
02:21:23,870 --> 02:21:24,810
Gajiro Saito

2692
02:21:24,810 --> 02:21:26,010
Gajiro Saito

2693
02:21:26,120 --> 02:21:27,310
Very good

2694
02:21:31,510 --> 02:21:36,090
Teruhiko Saigo

2695
02:21:35,010 --> 02:21:36,040
That's new

2696
02:21:36,090 --> 02:21:50,430
Teruhiko Saigo

2697
02:21:37,790 --> 02:21:50,430
Toshio Kurosawa

2698
02:21:41,530 --> 02:21:42,850
There's Toshio-san

2699
02:21:47,220 --> 02:21:48,610
Yes, he was laughing

2700
02:21:48,580 --> 02:21:49,970
Oh, he was ?

2701
02:21:54,200 --> 02:21:55,070
It's my turn

2702
02:21:56,710 --> 02:21:59,040
Eisaku Ohkawa

2703
02:21:59,040 --> 02:22:00,810
Eisaku Ohkawa

2704
02:22:00,990 --> 02:22:02,090
You got a pair

2705
02:22:02,730 --> 02:22:05,050
There's plenty new faces under these

2706
02:22:05,270 --> 02:22:06,550
I suppose I have to pick one

2707
02:22:06,550 --> 02:22:20,260
Shinichi Mori

2708
02:22:08,660 --> 02:22:10,560
It's Mori-san

2709
02:22:20,260 --> 02:22:32,510
Shinichi Mori

2710
02:22:23,200 --> 02:22:32,510
Naoko Ken

2711
02:22:24,310 --> 02:22:25,500
Excuse me ?

2712
02:22:31,280 --> 02:22:33,590
I've gotten lots of hits here

2713
02:22:33,950 --> 02:22:34,850
It's Naoko-san

2714
02:22:34,890 --> 02:22:37,980
I believe Endo just got away with laughing

2715
02:22:37,980 --> 02:22:39,630
Endo, you just got lucky

2716
02:22:40,340 --> 02:22:42,320
I have absolutely zero clue

2717
02:22:44,390 --> 02:22:55,800
Shiro Kishibe

2718
02:22:48,010 --> 02:22:50,080
He's still very charismatic

2719
02:22:54,100 --> 02:22:56,200
This card just owned us

2720
02:23:01,170 --> 02:23:08,340
Shiro Kishibe

2721
02:23:01,850 --> 02:23:03,330
That was a first Kishibe-san card

2722
02:23:03,330 --> 02:23:04,850
Why not just pick one next to it ?

2723
02:23:07,970 --> 02:23:09,830
You were just laughing straight up

2724
02:23:13,690 --> 02:23:14,770
Hamada-san, you, too

2725
02:23:14,770 --> 02:23:16,320
No way, I wasn't

2726
02:23:17,300 --> 02:23:18,870
I was just surprised, that's all

2727
02:23:18,930 --> 02:23:22,080
I let out a scream because he got the pair of Shiro Kishibe

2728
02:23:23,560 --> 02:23:26,830
Kishibe-san were laid out next to each other

2729
02:23:25,150 --> 02:23:26,820
Look how young he is

2730
02:23:32,550 --> 02:23:33,990
What to do, what to do ?

2731
02:23:34,140 --> 02:23:43,950
Shiro Kishibe

2732
02:23:48,750 --> 02:23:50,010
This guys is...

2733
02:23:57,760 --> 02:24:01,730
Gajiro Saito

2734
02:24:03,300 --> 02:24:14,480
Shinichi Mori

2735
02:24:10,670 --> 02:24:12,690
You were laughing at Mori-san, Tanaka ?

2736
02:24:13,150 --> 02:24:14,720
Actually at the telephone

2737
02:24:17,340 --> 02:24:18,710
So he's making a call

2738
02:24:20,550 --> 02:24:21,860
Why don't we shuffle these around again ?

2739
02:24:21,860 --> 02:24:22,890
What do you think ?

2740
02:24:25,940 --> 02:24:27,940
Let's shuffle them around

2741
02:24:27,320 --> 02:24:32,190
Gajiro Saito

2742
02:24:32,940 --> 02:24:34,530
Now, we're completely lost

2743
02:24:34,530 --> 02:24:36,760
It'd be more fun like this

2744
02:24:37,710 --> 02:24:39,340
Hamada-san, are you up next ?

2745
02:24:39,690 --> 02:24:42,650
Yeah, we'll just start everything over

2746
02:24:42,740 --> 02:24:45,840
Should I put these back then ?

2747
02:24:42,870 --> 02:24:51,620
Shiro Kishibe

2748
02:24:45,530 --> 02:24:46,640
No, keep them

2749
02:24:46,640 --> 02:24:47,960
That's OK

2750
02:24:48,480 --> 02:24:50,150
You should keep them

2751
02:24:50,150 --> 02:24:51,530
Since you earned it

2752
02:24:51,550 --> 02:24:53,050
Alright

2753
02:24:56,690 --> 02:25:02,530
Pinko Izumi

2754
02:24:57,120 --> 02:24:58,630
Here comes Pinko-san

2755
02:24:58,630 --> 02:24:59,730
I got Pinko-san

2756
02:25:02,530 --> 02:25:07,600
Pinko Izumi

2757
02:25:03,190 --> 02:25:04,090
Alright

2758
02:25:04,160 --> 02:25:07,600
Yukio Hashi

2759
02:25:05,680 --> 02:25:07,600
Yukio-san again

2760
02:25:09,700 --> 02:25:12,770
Akira Nishikino

2761
02:25:11,740 --> 02:25:12,760
Is this right ?

2762
02:25:12,770 --> 02:25:15,470
Akira Nishikino

2763
02:25:15,490 --> 02:25:16,550
You got a set of stars

2764
02:25:16,780 --> 02:25:18,180
I got these pairs

2765
02:25:19,180 --> 02:25:26,920
Matsumoto cards

2766
02:25:22,480 --> 02:25:26,920
Yamasaki cards

2767
02:25:24,280 --> 02:25:26,920
Hamada cards

2768
02:25:30,150 --> 02:25:32,370
No way, I'm OUT !

2769
02:25:32,950 --> 02:25:34,310
You got one tough pair

2770
02:25:38,990 --> 02:25:41,060
I wish Hamada-san would trade with mine

2771
02:25:41,360 --> 02:25:42,900
I'm just clueless

2772
02:25:42,900 --> 02:25:44,070
Let me pick one at the end

2773
02:25:45,100 --> 02:25:45,740
Naoko Ken

2774
02:25:45,330 --> 02:25:46,590
Oh, Naoko-san

2775
02:25:45,740 --> 02:25:47,800
Naoko Ken

2776
02:25:46,660 --> 02:25:47,580
She's right here

2777
02:25:47,690 --> 02:25:49,040
Alright

2778
02:25:49,100 --> 02:25:49,850
Very nice

2779
02:25:50,640 --> 02:26:00,720
Hamada cards

2780
02:25:50,850 --> 02:25:52,410
These are awesome pair

2781
02:25:52,410 --> 02:25:53,440
Check out this combo

2782
02:25:53,440 --> 02:25:54,300
See ?

2783
02:25:58,510 --> 02:26:00,300
Your voice started to wobble just now

2784
02:26:00,300 --> 02:26:02,220
I could tell you were going down

2785
02:26:00,810 --> 02:26:02,220
He's laughing

2786
02:26:02,240 --> 02:26:04,160
just by hear you talk

2787
02:26:05,290 --> 02:26:07,790
What's he doing now ?

2788
02:26:06,010 --> 02:26:07,820
Stay away !

2789
02:26:14,860 --> 02:26:15,900
He just laughed

2790
02:26:16,330 --> 02:26:17,800
I just caught him laughing

2791
02:26:21,830 --> 02:26:23,290
You two were getting out of hands

2792
02:26:23,290 --> 02:26:24,870
Don't be using our fellow celebrities as

2793
02:26:24,870 --> 02:26:26,940
some kind of laser gun

2794
02:26:30,450 --> 02:26:32,350
And he was still laughing just now, too

2795
02:26:32,350 --> 02:26:33,760
You laughed at Matsumoto-san's comment

2796
02:26:33,760 --> 02:26:34,950
about "laser gun"

2797
02:26:35,890 --> 02:26:37,720
Haven't you had enough horsing around ?

2798
02:26:41,680 --> 02:26:44,210
I wish I could've seen all of them

2799
02:26:44,360 --> 02:26:46,130
Why don't you stay put for a little while.

2800
02:26:46,460 --> 02:26:47,480
My butt hurts

2801
02:26:47,730 --> 02:26:49,210
My back hurts

2802
02:26:49,170 --> 02:26:50,420
Mine, too

2803
02:26:49,760 --> 02:26:50,420
This isn't good

2804
02:26:50,930 --> 02:26:55,700
9 Hours of Working
All Five Member's Butts are Being Tested !!

2805
02:26:56,070 --> 02:27:02,110
But the Real Hell

2806
02:26:56,070 --> 02:27:02,110
is about to begin!!

2807
02:27:04,070 --> 02:27:05,480
I saw Natsumi-san on Hotel introduction video

2808
02:27:05,520 --> 02:27:07,150
That was her debut on this series

2809
02:27:07,150 --> 02:27:08,910
Yes

2810
02:27:07,570 --> 02:27:08,890
Her debut indeed

2811
02:27:08,890 --> 02:27:11,340
All she did was talk with foreigners

2812
02:27:11,300 --> 02:27:12,620
She was having fun

2813
02:27:12,690 --> 02:27:15,420
Obviously, she recorded that prior to our show

2814
02:27:15,420 --> 02:27:18,690
How was she blessed with nice weather and not us ?

2815
02:27:19,450 --> 02:27:24,780
I got sucked into the New Onii's antics

2816
02:27:22,200 --> 02:27:44,620
NewOnii

2817
02:27:24,770 --> 02:27:25,840
He was incredible

2818
02:27:25,840 --> 02:27:27,210
He's a monster, isn't he ?

2819
02:27:27,210 --> 02:27:28,340
Yes, he's just a monster

2820
02:27:28,970 --> 02:27:32,040
What exactly happened with him and Paris Hilton ?

2821
02:27:32,040 --> 02:27:35,120
Well, he was told to impersonate her

2822
02:27:35,190 --> 02:27:37,280
But he realized he couldn't do it

2823
02:27:37,780 --> 02:27:39,800
so he more or the less lost it

2824
02:27:39,800 --> 02:27:41,650
And he started acting like a pest

2825
02:27:44,720 --> 02:27:45,650
Bang

2826
02:27:45,890 --> 02:27:49,590
Shocking Turn of Events

2827
02:27:50,290 --> 02:27:51,560
Then, let's go !

2828
02:27:53,260 --> 02:28:01,040
Top Celebrities
Ruthlessly Attacking the Casts!!

2829
02:28:01,270 --> 02:28:04,710
Unlikely Co-Starr

2830
02:28:06,480 --> 02:28:14,000
Laughing Hell Awaits !
What is About to Happen to These New Hotel Men ?!

2831
02:28:14,720 --> 02:28:19,710
Special Thanks to Alex

2833
02:28:15,210 --> 02:28:16,780
It's been 9 hours since the start

2834
02:28:17,040 --> 02:28:20,680
Time for one of the main events they hold at the hotel

2835
02:28:21,210 --> 02:28:22,610
Listen, guys

2836
02:28:23,280 --> 02:28:26,380
Let's go see how the wedding reception is held at this hotel

2837
02:28:26,380 --> 02:28:27,620
Here it is

2838
02:28:28,790 --> 02:28:32,660
It's held at the main building

2839
02:28:31,890 --> 02:28:33,690
Main building again ?

2840
02:28:35,760 --> 02:28:38,760
We'll be going by van again.

2841
02:28:39,730 --> 02:28:42,170
The atmosphere was kind of romantic at night

2842
02:28:42,530 --> 02:28:44,170
I guess the decorative lights caused it.

2843
02:28:48,670 --> 02:28:54,910
One of the main events: Wedding Reception
Off to Main Building by Gaki Nori Van!!

2844
02:28:55,350 --> 02:29:00,650
More Assault on Rookie Hotel Men
What Other Tricks are Waiting ?

2845
02:29:01,890 --> 02:29:03,660
Here's to the main hall

2846
02:29:05,490 --> 02:29:07,330
This way

2847
02:29:13,030 --> 02:29:18,140
Sit in a order of Yamasaki, Matsumoto, Hamada, Endo, and Tanaka

2848
02:29:23,070 --> 02:29:24,210
Be polite and congratulate them, OK ?

2849
02:29:24,210 --> 02:29:25,910
Be polite and congratulate them, OK ?

2850
02:29:25,940 --> 02:29:27,410
Look, there's a celebrity

2851
02:29:27,410 --> 02:29:29,080
We've seen him on TV

2852
02:29:27,710 --> 02:29:30,850
Attendee:

2853
02:29:27,710 --> 02:29:30,850
Haruka    Uehara

2854
02:29:31,680 --> 02:29:32,820
Stop, Taka-chan

2855
02:29:32,820 --> 02:29:33,950
Hold it, Taka-chan

2856
02:29:33,950 --> 02:29:34,890
Taka-chan, Taka-chan

2857
02:29:34,890 --> 02:29:35,820
Taka-chan, Taka-chan

2858
02:29:35,820 --> 02:29:41,160
A Child is Running Around

2859
02:29:36,120 --> 02:29:38,820
I told you to sit still at the wedding reception

2860
02:29:39,190 --> 02:29:40,590
Are you chewing ?

2861
02:29:41,160 --> 02:29:42,990
Are you chewing gum ?

2862
02:29:42,990 --> 02:29:44,500
Spit it out

2863
02:29:45,760 --> 02:29:47,200
And throw it away

2864
02:29:47,200 --> 02:29:49,000
Throw it away

2865
02:29:49,370 --> 02:29:50,540
Taka-chan

2866
02:29:52,670 --> 02:29:54,370
Ah !

2867
02:29:54,370 --> 02:29:59,340
Chewed Gum in Hair

2868
02:29:56,140 --> 02:29:57,710
I'm sorry

2869
02:29:57,710 --> 02:29:59,640
It's OK, no worries

2870
02:29:59,640 --> 02:30:01,280
It's OK, no worries

2871
02:30:08,090 --> 02:30:12,260
*Please, don't try this at home

2872
02:30:13,630 --> 02:30:16,190
God, it's SO glued on his head

2873
02:30:17,230 --> 02:30:19,330
No way, he can get that out

2874
02:30:19,330 --> 02:30:20,670
That's not acceptable

2875
02:30:20,670 --> 02:30:23,440
Mirror

2876
02:30:23,600 --> 02:30:26,370
Thank you all for waiting

2877
02:30:26,770 --> 02:30:30,140
It is time for the bride and groom make their entrance

2878
02:30:30,810 --> 02:30:34,010

2879
02:30:47,590 --> 02:30:49,490
Who is that woman ?

2880
02:30:54,300 --> 02:30:58,570
Bride

2881
02:30:54,300 --> 02:30:58,570
Groom

02:30:54,300 --> 02:30:58,570
Hisako Kuroi

2883
02:30:54,300 --> 02:30:58,570
Yoichi Numumizu

2884
02:30:59,440 --> 02:31:01,240
I don't believe she's a celebrity

2885
02:30:59,500 --> 02:31:01,370
Please give a warm reception

2886
02:31:01,370 --> 02:31:03,810
to the bride and the groom

2887
02:31:11,150 --> 02:31:15,890
Many of their friends and family are here to give congratulatory words

2888
02:31:11,520 --> 02:31:15,890
Congratulatory Words

2889
02:31:16,290 --> 02:31:17,120
Here is the bride's workplace manager

2890
02:31:17,120 --> 02:31:18,190
Here is the bride's workplace manager

2891
02:31:18,190 --> 02:31:19,660
Kazuo Nishio from Pizza Cap

2892
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:25,760
If you would come out please

2893
02:31:25,760 --> 02:31:28,670
Kazuo Nishio (Tomochika)

2894
02:31:25,760 --> 02:31:28,670
Pizza Cab

2895
02:31:30,470 --> 02:31:33,640
Well, I pre-arranged to park my motorbike by the front of the hotel

2896
02:31:33,940 --> 02:31:35,210
only to be told by the bellboys that I can't park my bike there

2897
02:31:35,210 --> 02:31:36,210
only to be told by the bellboys that I can't park my bike there

2898
02:31:36,210 --> 02:31:38,280
only to be told by the bellboys that I can't park my bike there

2899
02:31:38,280 --> 02:31:39,410
So I had to park by the main road

2900
02:31:44,520 --> 02:31:45,750
My ass hurts

2901
02:31:47,120 --> 02:31:49,050
Please, Yoshio-san

2902
02:31:52,590 --> 02:31:55,960
Why "pre-arranged" to park ?

2903
02:31:57,230 --> 02:32:00,570
Well, I'm in this booming and booming business of delivery service

2904
02:32:00,570 --> 02:32:03,300
Anyhow,with fewer staff in hand,

2905
02:32:03,300 --> 02:32:05,200
I'm now taking orders, too

2906
02:32:05,540 --> 02:32:07,240
At the end of this year we get new customers
who usually don't order pizza.

2907
02:32:07,240 --> 02:32:08,940
At the end of this year we get new customers
who usually don't order pizza.

2908
02:32:08,940 --> 02:32:10,440
Tons of them

2909
02:32:11,840 --> 02:32:13,380
And they don't have any clue on how to order

2910
02:32:13,380 --> 02:32:16,210
They just tell me to "put on some corn"
or, "put on some ham"

2911
02:32:16,210 --> 02:32:18,580
But I need to know the size first

2912
02:32:24,120 --> 02:32:25,490
Nishio-san is tough

2913
02:32:31,860 --> 02:32:34,370
And you know we're all in the same age group,

2914
02:32:34,370 --> 02:32:36,200
so we like to have BBQ and go for a drive on our days off together

2915
02:32:36,200 --> 02:32:37,540
so we like to have BBQ and go for a drive on our days off together

2916
02:32:38,100 --> 02:32:41,440
Anyway, you know our store manager is really into Mark II,

2917
02:32:41,440 --> 02:32:44,110
and he would buy this car every time there's been any little changes

2918
02:32:44,110 --> 02:32:48,050
So, now he has been driving the heck out of the new Mark X

2919
02:32:50,750 --> 02:32:52,150
What a moron

2920
02:32:55,420 --> 02:32:57,260
I personally know one (who likes Mark II)

2921
02:32:57,490 --> 02:32:59,420
I wish you happieness

2922
02:32:59,420 --> 02:33:00,360
Banzai !!

2923
02:33:09,530 --> 02:33:10,900
Damn it

2924
02:33:17,410 --> 02:33:21,280
Nishio-san never misses this series

2925
02:33:21,510 --> 02:33:25,250
Nishio-san sure gets around though

2926
02:33:25,320 --> 02:33:28,220
Here's one of groom's celebrity friends, who over the years,

2927
02:33:28,220 --> 02:33:31,790
has also become aquiented with the bride

2928
02:33:31,790 --> 02:33:34,430
Please give a warm welcome

2929
02:33:35,430 --> 02:33:37,560
Ah~

02:33:37,560 --> 02:33:40,030

02:33:55,810 --> 02:33:58,650
He would be my third Onii

2938
02:33:58,820 --> 02:34:00,750
Huh? Who ?

2939
02:34:00,180 --> 02:34:01,220
And...

2940
02:34:01,320 --> 02:34:03,290
I brought him here today

2941
02:34:03,290 --> 02:34:06,090
so that we can give our speech together

2942
02:34:06,090 --> 02:34:07,460

He's my third Onii

2947
02:34:20,770 --> 02:34:22,270
His name is Jyunji Endo

2948
02:34:22,270 --> 02:34:25,980
That's my younger brother

2949
02:34:31,550 --> 02:34:33,820
Endo's Younger Brother
Jyunji-san

2950
02:34:36,690 --> 02:34:39,460
Why is he here ?

2951
02:34:38,360 --> 02:34:40,290
Let me tell you what I'm into

2952
02:34:40,530 --> 02:34:41,130

2953

Or rather, why not show it ?

2954
02:34:41,930 --> 02:34:47,000
Chiaki's Favorite Skit

2955
02:34:44,660 --> 02:34:47,000
Seriously, don't do this

2956
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,100
What does he do for living ?

2957
02:34:50,300 --> 02:34:52,800
He's a Hotel Man

2958
02:34:52,800 --> 02:34:54,210
But he's definitely not like this

2959
02:34:54,410 --> 02:34:56,810
This is way out of his character

2960
02:34:56,810 --> 02:34:58,910
Don't do it

2961
02:35:01,080 --> 02:35:03,780
Seriously, don't do it

2962
02:35:07,850 --> 02:35:13,860
Borrowing Brother's Skit "Hohohoi"

Don't do this

2964
02:35:15,590 --> 02:35:17,260
This is not who you really are

2965
02:35:17,330 --> 02:35:20,900
Can you get down with Samba Rhythem ?

2966
02:35:19,260 --> 02:35:21,670
Wow, this is tough to watch

2967
02:35:20,900 --> 02:35:22,000
Ho Hoi !!

2968
02:35:22,230 --> 02:35:25,440

2969
02:35:25,440 --> 02:35:26,370

Just incredible

2974
02:35:37,350 --> 02:35:39,180
He's your real brother

2975
02:35:44,720 --> 02:35:45,890
Onii

2976
02:35:45,890 --> 02:35:47,960
I'm sure I'll truely be happy this time ♥

2977
02:35:50,600 --> 02:35:55,230
*Thank you, Jyunji-san, for your cooperation

2978
02:35:55,230 --> 02:36:01,270
Let us move on to tonight's entertainment

2979
02:35:57,440 --> 02:36:01,140
Entertainment

Taiko Ensemble Leader

2982
02:36:08,010 --> 02:36:10,210
Man, he is only skin and bones

This was really powerful

2984
02:36:13,790 --> 02:36:15,490
Yes, it was powerful

2985
02:36:33,340 --> 02:36:34,940
What is this...?

2986
02:36:50,460 --> 02:36:52,420
Ureyaaa~

2987
02:36:57,830 --> 02:36:59,760
Amazing

2988
02:36:59,700 --> 02:37:01,230
Awesome

2989
02:37:06,770 --> 02:37:08,840
How thin is he ?

2990
02:37:10,070 --> 02:37:11,540
We've invited one of grooms' friend

2991
02:37:11,540 --> 02:37:14,580
for a magic show

2992
02:37:14,350 --> 02:37:16,510
Please give them a warm welcome

02:37:59,120 --> 02:38:00,890
First, this is my "Card Tricks" !

2997
02:38:07,530 --> 02:38:09,630
Mr. Chono, what seems to be the problem ?

2998
02:38:09,730 --> 02:38:11,440
Hey !

2999
02:38:12,200 --> 02:38:13,200
My cards are missing !

3000
02:38:13,910 --> 02:38:18,510
Chono's Cards are Missing !!

3001
02:38:14,210 --> 02:38:16,010
What the hell's going on here ?

3002
02:38:16,410 --> 02:38:18,210
I can't go on like this !

3003
02:38:19,110 --> 02:38:19,980
Hey !

3004
02:38:20,110 --> 02:38:21,250
What gives ?!!

3005
02:38:21,250 --> 02:38:25,920
Anger is Aimed at the MC

3006
02:38:21,880 --> 02:38:23,480
We're very sorry about this

3007
02:38:26,250 --> 02:38:27,890
Please

3008
02:38:27,890 --> 02:38:30,050
This is not your responsibility

3009
02:38:30,050 --> 02:38:35,360
Groom Accepts Responsibility

3010
02:38:31,420 --> 02:38:32,820
I should be accountable for

3011
02:38:32,820 --> 02:38:35,460
anything that happens during my wedding reception

3012
02:38:35,630 --> 02:38:36,990
So go ahead and punish me however you see fit

3013
02:38:36,990 --> 02:38:40,000
So go ahead and punish me however you see fit

3014
02:38:40,030 --> 02:38:41,030
I'm not sure...

3015
02:38:41,170 --> 02:38:43,070
Wait !

3016
02:38:43,070 --> 02:38:45,300
I observed everything that just happened,

3017
02:38:45,300 --> 02:38:46,800
But let me first introduce myself

3018
02:38:46,800 --> 02:38:51,040
I'm in charge of the hotel's personnel department

3019
02:38:51,040 --> 02:38:53,040
My name is Fujiwara

3020
02:38:53,040 --> 02:38:56,880
We understand your frustration today

3021
02:38:56,880 --> 02:38:59,450
Because of the hotel's mistake,

3022
02:38:59,450 --> 02:39:03,420
you can't congratulate your friends

3023
02:39:03,420 --> 02:39:05,260
in the way you intended

3024
02:39:05,490 --> 02:39:08,090
So here's my suggestion

3025
02:39:08,090 --> 02:39:10,030
Well...

3026
02:39:10,030 --> 02:39:11,960
Wear this blindfolding mask...and...

3027
02:39:11,960 --> 02:39:12,900
Wear this blindfolding mask...and...

3028
02:39:12,900 --> 02:39:14,130
Wear this blindfolding mask...and...

3029
02:39:14,130 --> 02:39:17,170
Put these on and...

3030
02:39:18,670 --> 02:39:20,270
and if you can catch one of these five men,

3031
02:39:20,270 --> 02:39:22,270
and if you can catch one of these five men,

3032
02:39:22,270 --> 02:39:23,310
you can deliver a slap to him

3033
02:39:23,340 --> 02:39:29,610
Fujiwara's Suggestion
Catch Someone While Blindfolded and Deliver a Slap

3034
02:39:24,940 --> 02:39:27,180
How does that sound to you ?

3035
02:39:28,010 --> 02:39:29,210
This doesn't sound legitimate at all

3036
02:39:29,950 --> 02:39:31,650
Get over here then !

3037
02:39:31,750 --> 02:39:32,450
All of you

3038
02:39:32,650 --> 02:39:33,820
Hurry up

3039
02:39:34,120 --> 02:39:35,650
Wait a minute, just wait

3040
02:39:35,650 --> 02:39:37,820
We're going ?

3041
02:39:37,090 --> 02:39:38,890
All of you, line up here

3042
02:39:39,360 --> 02:39:40,630

Line up, in a single file

3044
02:39:42,730 --> 02:39:45,130
Let me put this blindhold on

3045
02:39:54,670 --> 02:39:58,080
See-through Mask

3046
02:39:59,110 --> 02:40:00,510
I just need to grab one, right ?

3047
02:40:00,510 --> 02:40:02,350
Anybody, right ?

3048
02:40:03,380 --> 02:40:04,520
What's going on here ?

3049
02:40:09,290 --> 02:40:14,130
Yamasaki is Targeted

3050
02:40:14,330 --> 02:40:14,860
Hey !

3051
02:40:16,430 --> 02:40:18,600
Don't try to get away

3052
02:40:22,930 --> 02:40:24,700
Get back in line, all of you !!

3053
02:40:28,810 --> 02:40:30,010
How's this ?

3054
02:40:31,780 --> 02:40:33,280
Is this it ?

3055
02:40:37,110 --> 02:40:38,050
Or, who's this guy !?

3056
02:40:38,050 --> 02:40:39,420
Don't try to get away !

3057
02:40:41,650 --> 02:40:43,420
Who's this tough guy ?!

3058
02:40:48,290 --> 02:40:49,760
Not good, not good

3059
02:40:50,190 --> 02:40:52,530
Damn you, Yamasaki

3060
02:40:52,530 --> 02:40:54,970
Look at me !

3061
02:40:54,970 --> 02:40:56,330
The rest of you ! Take your seats !

3062
02:40:56,330 --> 02:40:57,200
You stay here

3063
02:40:57,470 --> 02:41:00,170
Don't you leave, asshole !

3064
02:41:00,200 --> 02:41:01,270
Please wait

3065
02:41:01,510 --> 02:41:02,940
Put your uniform back on

3066
02:41:03,540 --> 02:41:05,510
Why me ?

3067
02:41:04,410 --> 02:41:05,540
I'm not finished yet !

3068
02:41:05,540 --> 02:41:07,410
C'mon, give me a minute !

3069
02:41:06,540 --> 02:41:07,410
Hey !

Why ??!!

3072
02:41:15,120 --> 02:41:16,520
Yamasaki, seriously

3073
02:41:16,620 --> 02:41:18,160
I'm begging you

3074
02:41:19,360 --> 02:41:20,730
Just get this over with

3075
02:41:21,230 --> 02:41:22,830
Please, let's just do this

3076
02:41:23,190 --> 02:41:24,130
What the hell do you want ?!

3077
02:41:24,230 --> 02:41:27,260
What does this mean ?

3078
02:41:25,200 --> 02:41:26,200
What are you asking ?

3079
02:41:27,570 --> 02:41:30,570
You could see me with that fake mask !!

3080
02:41:30,570 --> 02:41:32,670
It was semi-see-through !

3081
02:41:36,670 --> 02:41:39,380
Are you accusing me of cheating ?

3082
02:41:39,380 --> 02:41:41,210
How about a Double-Slap then ?

3083
02:41:41,210 --> 02:41:41,650
Please, wait a minute

02:41:41,650 --> 02:41:42,780

What is exactly going on here ?

3097
02:41:55,430 --> 02:41:56,460
Quit it already

3098
02:42:00,870 --> 02:42:02,000
You have no choice !

3099
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:03,900
You have no choice !

3100
02:42:04,340 --> 02:42:05,770
Yamasaki-san, just get this over with

3101
02:42:05,770 --> 02:42:08,670
You (Tanaka), you had your turn this morning

3102
02:42:08,140 --> 02:42:09,070
Please, just do this

3103
02:42:09,070 --> 02:42:09,870
It'll be good for all of us

3104
02:42:09,870 --> 02:42:11,010
What do you mean "good for all of us" ??

3105
02:42:11,080 --> 02:42:12,410
Aggghhh

3106
02:42:13,580 --> 02:42:15,580
Seriously, why me ?

3107
02:42:18,920 --> 02:42:20,180
Of course I couldn't see with it on

3108
02:42:20,180 --> 02:42:22,550
I can clearly SEE YOU !!

3109
02:42:22,920 --> 02:42:24,490
Yes, I can see you !

3110
02:42:24,490 --> 02:42:26,660
I can see you, Chono-san !!

3111
02:42:25,290 --> 02:42:26,320
Just get over here

3112
02:42:26,320 --> 02:42:27,420
Wait !

3113
02:42:27,260 --> 02:42:27,890
I can see you!

3114
02:42:27,890 --> 02:42:28,430
No

3115
02:42:28,430 --> 02:42:28,860
No No

3116
02:42:28,860 --> 02:42:29,030
No, No, No !!

3117
02:42:29,030 --> 02:42:29,230
No, No, No !!

3118
02:42:29,230 --> 02:42:29,660
No, No, No !!

3119
02:42:32,500 --> 02:42:34,730
We've seen enough of this !

3120
02:42:36,230 --> 02:42:37,940
Let go of me !

3121
02:42:39,600 --> 02:42:44,210
You stayed close to him
so he couldn't slap you

3122
02:42:45,510 --> 02:42:47,310
This is taking too long

3123
02:42:47,310 --> 02:42:48,510
Too long!

3124
02:42:48,510 --> 02:42:50,680
I know what you're saying

3125
02:42:50,680 --> 02:42:51,320
Yes

3126
02:42:51,120 --> 02:42:51,920
Arrrggghhh~!!

3127
02:42:52,250 --> 02:42:53,950
Ouch ! You got my ear !!

3128
02:42:58,190 --> 02:43:00,120
Damn it, we've had enough of this !

3129
02:43:03,690 --> 02:43:05,760
How phony are you ?

3130
02:43:05,760 --> 02:43:07,630
Your friends get punished for your antics

3131
02:43:07,730 --> 02:43:08,970
Get over here

3132
02:43:10,230 --> 02:43:11,440
Could you use your left hand?

3133
02:43:11,500 --> 02:43:12,340
No, I can only use my right hand

3134
02:43:14,470 --> 02:43:15,840
Then will you not take that stance ?

3135
02:43:16,440 --> 02:43:18,340
Your requests are getting more annoying every year

3136
02:43:18,680 --> 02:43:19,940
I'm sorry

3137
02:43:19,940 --> 02:43:21,710
but if you could grant my request, I'd do this

3138
02:43:23,310 --> 02:43:24,520
Get over here then

3139
02:43:25,920 --> 02:43:26,650
Ah, I'd be scared

3140
02:43:26,650 --> 02:43:27,280
Ah, I'd be scared

3141
02:43:27,280 --> 02:43:27,850
Yes

3142
02:43:27,920 --> 02:43:28,520
I got it

3143
02:43:28,790 --> 02:43:29,520
Wait !

3144
02:43:29,550 --> 02:43:30,420
Hold on !

3145
02:43:40,460 --> 02:43:42,370
I'm scared !

3146
02:43:43,930 --> 02:43:45,740
You must've been scared

3147
02:43:46,140 --> 02:43:47,740
Because this isn't just
an everyday slap

3148
02:43:46,900 --> 02:43:48,310
If you try to get away, it'll hurt more

3149
02:43:47,610 --> 02:43:48,910
I know, I know

3150
02:43:48,610 --> 02:43:51,010
I know you're taking a hit for everybody else today

3151
02:43:51,840 --> 02:43:53,840
You're starting your new year's right

3152
02:43:53,840 --> 02:43:54,810
What now ?

3153
02:43:54,910 --> 02:43:55,410
I'm ready

3154
02:43:56,850 --> 02:43:58,650
Here we go

3155
02:43:59,920 --> 02:44:01,020
Man up !!

3156
02:44:09,490 --> 02:44:16,170
Unfair Slap Moment !!

3157
02:44:12,760 --> 02:44:14,230
This really does hurt a lot

3158
02:44:24,880 --> 02:44:25,980
Out of control

3159
02:44:26,740 --> 02:44:30,080
And we got slapped for laughing
at you getting slapped

3160
02:44:31,180 --> 02:44:31,980
It is out of control

3161
02:44:34,020 --> 02:44:35,220
This was hellish

3162
02:44:46,330 --> 02:44:47,600
What an awesome wedding reception that was

3163
02:44:47,600 --> 02:44:49,600
Let's head back

3164
02:44:50,200 --> 02:44:53,470
He never gave up trying to get that gum out of his hair

3165
02:44:56,670 --> 02:44:58,640
He never took his eyes off that mirror

3166
02:44:59,810 --> 02:45:01,280
It's been 10 and a half hours since the start

3167
02:45:01,750 --> 02:45:03,810
After the reception,

3168
02:45:03,810 --> 02:45:05,620
they're back in their break room

3169
02:45:06,750 --> 02:45:09,150
I need to go pee

3170
02:45:09,850 --> 02:45:11,790
What's my world coming to ?

3171
02:45:11,790 --> 02:45:12,990
I'm 46 and getting my ass slapped everytime I laugh

3172
02:45:12,990 --> 02:45:15,260
I'm 46 and getting my ass slapped everytime I laugh

3173
02:45:15,530 --> 02:45:16,790
What's our average age this year ?

3174
02:45:20,360 --> 02:45:21,430
What ?

3175
02:45:22,370 --> 02:45:23,870
What's this ?

3176
02:45:23,870 --> 02:45:24,540
Again ?

3177
02:45:24,640 --> 02:45:28,040
Today's Third Mysterious DVD

3178
02:45:24,700 --> 02:45:26,000
We have another one

3179
02:45:30,040 --> 02:45:34,180
Photo of Gajiro on his chair

3180
02:45:37,350 --> 02:45:41,250
Sets it up for Matsumoto

3181
02:45:48,560 --> 02:45:54,160
Eisaku Ohkawa

3182
02:45:58,840 --> 02:45:59,640
Wait a sec

3183
02:45:59,640 --> 02:46:00,700
Why is this here ?

3184
02:46:00,700 --> 02:46:01,440
Why ?

3185
02:46:01,440 --> 02:46:02,170
What's so funny ?

3186
02:46:02,240 --> 02:46:02,910
Wait a sec

3187
02:46:02,910 --> 02:46:04,440
Why, why, why ?

3188
02:46:05,240 --> 02:46:06,640
We returned these photos

3189
02:46:07,040 --> 02:46:07,980
Ouch

3190
02:46:11,280 --> 02:46:12,750
Man...

3191
02:46:12,750 --> 02:46:14,920
Staffs are evil for doing this to us

3192
02:46:14,920 --> 02:46:19,920
Eisaku Ohkawa

3193
02:46:14,920 --> 02:46:19,920
Places it inside Matsumoto's desk drawer

3194
02:46:17,650 --> 02:46:19,020
You got anything in yours, Tanaka ?

3195
02:46:19,390 --> 02:46:19,990
I got this one

3196
02:46:19,990 --> 02:46:21,290
Quickly

3197
02:46:21,590 --> 02:46:27,600
Gajiro Saito

3198
02:46:25,060 --> 02:46:26,230
What the hell were you guys doing ?

3199
02:46:29,170 --> 02:46:31,040
Hide that, he's coming back

3200
02:46:32,840 --> 02:46:35,640
How irritating is this setup ?

3201
02:46:37,670 --> 02:46:39,180
We got counter-struck

3202
02:46:39,410 --> 02:46:40,280
What now ?

3203
02:46:40,280 --> 02:46:41,710
What's going on ?

3204
02:46:42,380 --> 02:46:45,450
We were laughing at some things that happened here today

3205
02:46:45,980 --> 02:46:49,490
Gajiro Saito

3206
02:46:59,930 --> 02:47:00,560
Who ?

3207
02:47:11,980 --> 02:47:13,080
And what do you have there ?

3208
02:47:13,410 --> 02:47:14,610
This is a new one

3209
02:47:15,380 --> 02:47:17,980
I'm sure they want us to watch it

3210
02:47:18,280 --> 02:47:20,450
Should we ?

3211
02:47:20,750 --> 02:47:23,720
Let's watch it now rather than later

3212
02:47:28,990 --> 02:47:33,000
Lyrics: Ken Chin Fua

3213
02:47:28,990 --> 02:47:33,000
Music: Hiroaki Serizawa

3214
02:47:28,990 --> 02:47:33,000
Touch

3215
02:47:30,230 --> 02:47:31,230
Here it is again

3216
02:47:31,330 --> 02:47:33,000
Here we go again

3217
02:47:33,160 --> 02:47:34,330
The same routine

3218
02:47:35,730 --> 02:47:37,900
Holding his breath for a moment

3219
02:47:37,900 --> 02:47:41,410
Tanaka gives a serious look

3220
02:47:41,410 --> 02:47:44,510
And he hears nothing after that

3221
02:47:44,510 --> 02:47:46,880
Tanaka is lonesome

3222
02:47:46,880 --> 02:47:50,510
He won't admit just how much

3223
02:47:50,510 --> 02:47:53,380
he loves the ones he cares about

3224
02:47:53,380 --> 02:47:58,290
He simply ignores his tear drops

3225
02:47:58,290 --> 02:48:05,060
How many times does he have to

3226
02:48:05,060 --> 02:48:08,470
follow the same path

3227
02:48:08,500 --> 02:48:11,600
to save Tanaka

3228
02:48:11,600 --> 02:48:13,040
So, please

3229
02:48:13,040 --> 02:48:13,770
Kick, kick, kick him in his ass

3230
02:48:13,770 --> 02:48:14,510
Kick, kick, kick him in his ass

3231
02:48:14,510 --> 02:48:15,870
Kick, kick, kick him in his ass

3232
02:48:15,870 --> 02:48:19,380
Just give it to Tanaka

3233
02:48:19,480 --> 02:48:25,980
Stick your ass out and get kicked

3234
02:48:25,980 --> 02:48:30,550
Kick him so hard all he can do is sigh

3235
02:48:31,960 --> 02:48:33,520
You're kidding me, right ?

3236
02:48:33,960 --> 02:48:37,790
Tanaka Receives Thai Kick

3237
02:48:36,430 --> 02:48:38,500
This isn't cool at all

3238
02:48:39,100 --> 02:48:40,500
This isn't cool

3239
02:48:40,500 --> 02:48:41,770
Why me ?

3240
02:48:42,070 --> 02:48:45,000
Stay still or it'll hurt more

3241
02:48:52,840 --> 02:48:55,210
That's difficult to take

3242
02:49:03,850 --> 02:49:06,190
Getting a Thai Kick right now is merciless

3243
02:49:06,560 --> 02:49:07,930
Why me ?

3244
02:49:08,490 --> 02:49:10,860
That killed

3245
02:49:14,430 --> 02:49:18,140
Shirou Kishibe

3246
02:49:25,940 --> 02:49:28,610
Why don't you open this drawer ?

3247
02:49:32,420 --> 02:49:35,920
Shirou Kishibe

3248
02:49:43,930 --> 02:49:45,930
That caught me off guard

3249
02:49:46,730 --> 02:49:48,670
This is exactly what I didn't want to see happen

3250
02:49:48,670 --> 02:49:51,440
We should have returned all of these props

3251
02:49:51,440 --> 02:49:54,610
I DID return them

3252
02:49:53,670 --> 02:49:54,610
Yeah, we did

3253
02:49:55,070 --> 02:49:57,670
Matsumoto-san, why don't you check yours ?

3254
02:49:58,580 --> 02:50:01,780
Eisaku Ohkawa

3255
02:50:04,180 --> 02:50:06,720
This is what happens when you don't return things

3256
02:50:12,120 --> 02:50:14,520
I suspected this kind of thing would happen

3257
02:50:15,690 --> 02:50:20,700
Gajiro Saito

3258
02:50:35,350 --> 02:50:36,510
Let's cut this out

3259
02:50:36,510 --> 02:50:37,780
Let's stop

3260
02:50:37,850 --> 02:50:39,820
No more of this

3261
02:50:40,020 --> 02:50:43,220
Nothing good can come out of this

3262
02:50:50,730 --> 02:50:51,730
Here we go again

3263
02:50:54,230 --> 02:50:56,270
Here comes the Po Channel

3264
02:50:57,270 --> 02:50:59,940
Enjoy how Heipo has fared so far

3265
02:51:06,640 --> 02:51:09,050
Ding Dong

3266
02:51:07,810 --> 02:51:09,050
Who is it ?

3267
02:51:09,250 --> 02:51:10,910
Ding Dong

3268
02:51:09,910 --> 02:51:11,210
No, No way

3269
02:51:12,080 --> 02:51:14,420
What do you want ?

3270
02:51:15,050 --> 02:51:16,350
Who is it ?

3271
02:51:17,920 --> 02:51:18,090
Who ? Who ? Who ?

3272
02:51:18,090 --> 02:51:18,260
Who ? Who ? Who ?

3273
02:51:18,260 --> 02:51:19,120
Who ? Who ? Who ?

3274
02:51:19,120 --> 02:51:21,260
Excuse me, Heipo-san ?

3275
02:51:21,390 --> 02:51:23,530
You scared me

3276
02:51:24,190 --> 02:51:24,900
What is...

3277
02:51:27,530 --> 02:51:28,730
What happened ?

3278
02:51:28,730 --> 02:51:30,570
You're bored, aren't you, Heipo-san ?

3279
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:30,600
I'm bored

3280
02:51:30,600 --> 02:51:32,100
But I don't wanna stay here any longer

3281
02:51:32,100 --> 02:51:32,870
I wanna go home

3282
02:51:32,870 --> 02:51:35,010
I thought you'd be bored

3283
02:51:35,010 --> 02:51:37,710
So I brought you some videos to watch

3284
02:51:35,740 --> 02:51:36,470
No, no way

3285
02:51:36,470 --> 02:51:37,610
I'm scared

3286
02:51:38,180 --> 02:51:42,580
I don't wanna watch any videos

3287
02:51:42,580 --> 02:51:45,080
Fun Video

3288
02:51:46,850 --> 02:51:48,520
What the heck is this ?

3289
02:51:50,590 --> 02:51:52,360
I see they're beetles

3290
02:51:52,360 --> 02:51:54,060
I'm terrified of the beetles

3291
02:51:54,390 --> 02:51:56,490
Man, look at them fighting each other

3292
02:51:56,490 --> 02:51:57,290
How scary

3293
02:51:57,760 --> 02:51:59,700
Why're they so shiny anyway ?

3294
02:51:59,700 --> 02:52:00,300
And he's up, he's up, he's up

3295
02:52:00,300 --> 02:52:00,760
And he's up, he's up, he's up

3296
02:52:00,760 --> 02:52:02,200
And he's up, he's up, he's up

3297
02:52:02,200 --> 02:52:04,430
He's picked up ever so high

3298
02:52:05,440 --> 02:52:06,600
He's picked up

3299
02:52:17,880 --> 02:52:18,520
I'm scared

3300
02:52:19,550 --> 02:52:20,750
This is scary

3301
02:52:20,750 --> 02:52:22,320
Man, the lion's going at it

3302
02:52:22,320 --> 02:52:25,320
Well, no, I mean, he's actually attacking it

3303
02:52:26,190 --> 02:52:29,630
How is this video OK ?

3304
02:52:36,230 --> 02:52:37,030
No more

3305
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:40,400
I'm scared !

3306
02:52:40,500 --> 02:52:41,740
That is gross

3307
02:52:43,070 --> 02:52:44,110
No good

3308
02:52:44,110 --> 02:52:45,540
Not one bit

3309
02:52:46,880 --> 02:52:48,580
This is something else

3310
02:52:48,580 --> 02:52:51,820
Man, I hate blood

3311
02:52:51,820 --> 02:52:53,380
I hate this

3312
02:52:53,380 --> 02:52:55,250
I can't do this

3313
02:52:55,750 --> 02:52:56,090
Ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch!!

3314
02:52:56,090 --> 02:52:56,190
Ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch!!

3315
02:52:56,190 --> 02:52:56,290
Ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch!!

3316
02:52:56,290 --> 02:52:56,390
Ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch!!

3317
02:52:56,390 --> 02:52:56,490
Ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch!!

3318
02:52:56,490 --> 02:52:56,550
Ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch!!

3319
02:52:56,550 --> 02:52:56,620
Ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch!!

3320
02:52:56,620 --> 02:52:56,690
Ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch!!

3321
02:52:56,690 --> 02:52:56,750
Ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch! ouch!!

3322

OUCH! OUCH!

3335
02:52:58,590 --> 02:53:01,730
Man, that hurt

3336
02:53:03,130 --> 02:53:04,560
What ?

3337
02:53:06,030 --> 02:53:08,470
What's this ? A dragonfly ?

3338
02:53:06,830 --> 02:53:08,470
What is he, a newborn baby ?

3339
02:53:08,700 --> 02:53:10,470
He's fascinated by everything he sees

3340
02:53:10,270 --> 02:53:12,400
I see, it is a dragonfly

3341
02:53:13,800 --> 02:53:16,670
Ahhh, Amazing

3342
02:53:20,380 --> 02:53:24,880
Couldn't you have edited without static ?

3343
02:53:24,880 --> 02:53:26,680
Huh ?

3344
02:53:26,920 --> 02:53:29,220
What the hell ??

3345
02:53:30,820 --> 02:53:33,420
What're they doing ?

3346
02:53:31,490 --> 02:53:33,720
He can't keep his mouth shut

3347
02:53:35,090 --> 02:53:36,390
What ?

3348
02:53:37,560 --> 02:53:40,160
That's disgusting

3349
02:53:49,070 --> 02:53:50,840
I don't like this channel

3350
02:53:58,550 --> 02:54:00,820
I'm not a fan of "Po Channel"

3351
02:54:05,190 --> 02:54:08,230
Why don't we visit

3352
02:54:08,230 --> 02:54:10,730

02:54:16,400 --> 02:54:17,370
Musical ?

3357
02:54:23,610 --> 02:54:26,280
We haven't done any Hotel Men duties today

3358
02:54:26,840 --> 02:54:28,040
Really

3359
02:54:31,310 --> 02:54:37,690

3362
02:54:49,300 --> 02:54:50,570
I'm starting to feel

3363
02:54:50,570 --> 02:54:53,240
uneasy about this...

3364
02:54:53,800 --> 02:54:56,210
Thank you very much

02:55:08,650 --> 02:55:11,250
And here's the title

3371
02:55:23,530 --> 02:55:25,670

Married for 37 years
Claudia Umemiya

3386
02:56:33,740 --> 02:56:36,140
This is a tough cast

3387
02:56:41,240 --> 02:56:43,910
There goes Claudia-san again

3388
02:56:43,250 --> 02:56:46,280
I'd like to ask the actors to get ready for the start of the musical

3389
02:56:48,720 --> 02:56:53,390
I still don't know who's playing Rocky

3390
02:56:54,020 --> 02:56:56,130

02:57:43,040 --> 02:57:43,510
What ?

3395
02:57:43,510 --> 02:57:45,180

Get on with Rocky already

3399
02:58:09,970 --> 02:58:11,470
Where's Rocky ?!

3400
02:58:13,340 --> 02:58:15,970
He must've practiced his ass off for this

3401
02:58:25,520 --> 02:58:27,180
That's pretty cool

3402
02:58:33,120 --> 02:58:34,490
An amazing performance !

3403
02:58:40,130 --> 02:58:42,870
He must've practiced really hard for that

Yeah, really

3407
02:58:45,800 --> 02:58:47,940
That time-filler was uncalled for

3408
02:58:49,540 --> 02:58:51,010
Here we go

3409
02:58:51,210 --> 02:58:55,550

the undefeated and undisputed champion of the world

3417
02:59:20,040 --> 02:59:24,140
Why did I pick that street thug as my next opponent ?

3418
02:59:24,140 --> 02:59:28,010
I'm doing it to create a buzz and gain popularity

3419
02:59:28,010 --> 02:59:29,310
That's all

3420
02:59:36,720 --> 02:59:41,190
In the meantime, Rocky is...

3421
02:59:41,520 --> 02:59:42,530

02:59:45,630 --> 02:59:46,530
Let me ask you

3426
02:59:46,530 --> 02:59:49,000
Have you seen a man in a black hat with a leather jacket

3427
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:51,730
And he has a husky voice

3428
02:59:51,730 --> 02:59:52,970
Where're you, Rocky ?!

3429
02:59:52,970 --> 02:59:54,400
Rocky !?

3430
02:59:59,610 --> 03:00:02,950
Claudia Umemiya

3431
02:59:59,610 --> 03:00:02,950
Rocky

3432
03:00:02,950 --> 03:00:04,980
Shouldn't she be Adrian ?

3433
03:00:05,920 --> 03:00:09,750
He's supposed to be drunk ?

3434
03:00:07,450 --> 03:00:10,050
He's drinking

3435
03:00:13,290 --> 03:00:15,020
What's she doing ?

3436
03:00:19,730 --> 03:00:22,400
Why're you swaying back and forth ?

3437
03:00:24,230 --> 03:00:27,870
Rocky ! Where've you been ?

3438
03:00:28,400 --> 03:00:33,540
Her Lines Are Written on a Cheat Sheet

3439
03:00:29,640 --> 03:00:31,510
Well, I was heading to your office...

3440
03:00:31,510 --> 03:00:35,450
Well, I was heading to your office...

3441
03:00:36,750 --> 03:00:38,850
You mean, the gym ?

3442
03:00:38,850 --> 03:00:41,150
Office ?

3443
03:00:41,450 --> 03:00:43,450
You know I'm your best friend, right ?

3444
03:00:43,450 --> 03:00:44,920
You know I'm your best friend, right ?

3445
03:00:44,920 --> 03:00:51,490
No, you're not my best partner

3446
03:00:51,490 --> 03:00:53,530
Adrian...

3447
03:00:53,530 --> 03:00:57,100
You're my everything !

3448
03:00:57,830 --> 03:01:03,640
Adrian

3449
03:01:02,810 --> 03:01:04,110
I see, this is a musical

3450
03:01:03,640 --> 03:01:09,910
I love you

3451
03:01:06,010 --> 03:01:07,810
She's clearly laughing

3452
03:01:09,910 --> 03:01:12,680
She's not even trying to hide her laughter

3453
03:01:10,580 --> 03:01:13,550
I'm crazy about

3454
03:01:13,550 --> 03:01:18,120
everything about you

3455
03:01:14,120 --> 03:01:16,090
She's straight-up laughing

3456
03:01:16,720 --> 03:01:18,690
Damn it...

3457
03:01:22,390 --> 03:01:24,890
Terrible

3458
03:01:24,890 --> 03:01:27,760
Once again, she didn't memorize her lines

3459
03:01:27,760 --> 03:01:34,300
A Dog's Bark Introduces the Next Scene

3460

03:01:47,850 --> 03:01:52,820
5 Minutes Later

3462
03:01:49,750 --> 03:01:51,450
I'm not kiddin'

3463
03:01:58,490 --> 03:02:00,000
Man, this is taking too long

3464
03:02:05,130 --> 03:02:07,170
I was getting agitated

3465
03:02:07,770 --> 03:02:10,070
Don't they have any other SE (Sound Effect) ??

3466
03:02:11,740 --> 03:02:15,880
As Rocky prepares to challenge the world heavy weight champion

3467
03:02:15,880 --> 03:02:17,810
Apollo for the title

3468
03:02:17,810 --> 03:02:19,880

3469
03:02:19,880 --> 03:02:22,650

3470
03:02:22,650 --> 03:02:27,520
Both Fighters' Training Begins

3471
03:02:46,280 --> 03:02:48,310

03:02:53,350 --> 03:02:57,750
And finally, the day of the fight arrives

3475
03:03:00,160 --> 03:03:03,390
Where's Adrian ?

3476
03:03:01,760 --> 03:03:03,130

3484
03:03:30,950 --> 03:03:32,420
Go Rocky

3485
03:03:32,990 --> 03:03:34,720
Use your feet

3486
03:03:39,800 --> 03:03:41,300
There he landed one

3487
03:03:45,970 --> 03:03:47,600
What is this ?

3488
03:03:47,940 --> 03:03:49,310
Go Rocky !

3489
03:03:50,340 --> 03:03:51,470
Crash

3490
03:03:52,480 --> 03:03:53,510
Crash

3491
03:03:54,510 --> 03:03:55,650
Crash

3492
03:03:55,650 --> 03:04:00,020
Referee Falls Off the Stage

3493
03:04:04,690 --> 03:04:07,120
*Star is so serious

3494
03:04:06,690 --> 03:04:08,190
*Star is his nickname

3495
03:04:14,030 --> 03:04:17,270
What do you think you're doing ?

3496
03:04:17,500 --> 03:04:19,970
I'm just gettin' started

3497
03:04:19,970 --> 03:04:22,240
Shut the hell up, old man !

3498
03:04:32,520 --> 03:04:35,250
Ohhhh ~

3499
03:04:36,450 --> 03:04:41,120
Let the Slow-Motion Start !!

3500
03:04:41,520 --> 03:04:42,960

3501
03:04:54,440 --> 03:04:56,170

3502
03:05:12,420 --> 03:05:13,920
He's no match for you, Rocky !

3503
03:05:14,190 --> 03:05:16,790
Shut the hell up, stupid old man !

3504
03:05:41,580 --> 03:05:43,790
Final Round !

3505
03:05:54,800 --> 03:05:56,300
Now, Rocky, Get him !!

3506
03:06:04,570 --> 03:06:05,980
Down !

3507
03:06:28,460 --> 03:06:34,870
A Dramatic Finale Follows Rocky's Victory

3508
03:06:35,300 --> 03:06:37,110
Where's Adrian ?

3509
03:06:37,110 --> 03:06:38,910
I guess she's not in this play

3510
03:06:39,340 --> 03:06:41,840
Adrian !

3511
03:06:41,840 --> 03:06:43,710
Adrian !

3512
03:06:44,880 --> 03:06:50,820
Adrian

3513
03:06:44,880 --> 03:06:50,820
Special Guest

3514
03:06:44,880 --> 03:06:50,820
Tatsuo Umemiya

3515
03:06:46,920 --> 03:06:48,250
Claudia !

3516
03:06:48,280 --> 03:06:49,690
Adrian

3517
03:06:49,690 --> 03:06:50,820
Claudia !

3518
03:06:51,220 --> 03:06:52,490
Adrian !

3519
03:06:52,720 --> 03:06:55,060
Claudia !

3520
03:06:55,060 --> 03:06:56,160
Adrian !

3521
03:06:56,560 --> 03:06:57,890
You're kiddin' me, right ?

3522
03:06:59,460 --> 03:07:01,200
Claudia

3523
03:07:01,200 --> 03:07:03,030
I love you !

3524
03:07:03,030 --> 03:07:04,700
I love you, too, Adrian !

3525
03:07:05,840 --> 03:07:08,000
I love you

3526
03:07:08,640 --> 03:07:10,770
I love you

3527
03:07:11,510 --> 03:07:13,180
Damn it

3528
03:07:37,500 --> 03:07:39,070
Great performance

3529
03:07:39,240 --> 03:07:41,670
This will be a long year for her

3530
03:07:41,670 --> 03:07:46,340
She needs some help real quick

3531
03:07:47,340 --> 03:07:48,810
It's been 12 hours since the start

3532
03:07:49,010 --> 03:07:51,410
Game is at half way point

3533
03:08:03,390 --> 03:08:07,330
Hamada is cautious of the drawer

3534
03:08:17,010 --> 03:08:21,480
Gajiro Saito

3535
03:08:17,010 --> 03:08:21,480
Set it up for Hamada's desk drawer

3536
03:08:24,350 --> 03:08:27,980
Naoko Ken

3537
03:08:29,490 --> 03:08:30,820
Have you seen this yet ?

3538
03:08:36,060 --> 03:08:38,390
Anything goes at this point

3539
03:08:41,660 --> 03:08:44,530
I don't agree with that

3540
03:08:44,630 --> 03:08:45,630
What you gonna do ?

3541
03:08:45,800 --> 03:08:46,900
Seriously ?

3542
03:08:47,870 --> 03:08:49,640
There's not much you can do

3543
03:08:51,040 --> 03:08:53,480
I think they just got the wrong guy

3544
03:08:53,740 --> 03:08:55,580
What's going on ?

3545
03:08:56,380 --> 03:08:58,310
He got caught laughing by himself

3546
03:09:00,420 --> 03:09:03,150
Did it just get chilly in here ?

3547
03:09:03,790 --> 03:09:05,550
Endo, can you grab me an orange juice ?

3548
03:09:07,420 --> 03:09:08,820
Maybe you should gargle

3549
03:09:09,090 --> 03:09:10,790
I've already done that once

3550
03:09:12,330 --> 03:09:15,500
Naoko Ken

3551
03:09:20,470 --> 03:09:22,340
Hamada san

3552
03:09:22,570 --> 03:09:24,640
When I went to grab the juice,

3553
03:09:24,640 --> 03:09:26,880
I noticed Ken Naoko-san inside

3554
03:09:27,180 --> 03:09:28,940
Are there any toothpicks around ?

3555
03:09:29,910 --> 03:09:31,710
I've seen them in here

3556
03:09:30,880 --> 03:09:35,890
Gajiro Saito

3557
03:09:39,520 --> 03:09:41,060
Please remove your cup

3558
03:09:41,090 --> 03:09:42,160
Yes, please

3559
03:09:41,120 --> 03:09:42,320
Please

3560
03:09:42,320 --> 03:09:43,160
Remove it, please ?

3561
03:09:47,400 --> 03:09:48,800
There's no arguing about that one

3562
03:09:48,900 --> 03:09:50,170
That wasn't good, Hamada san

3563
03:09:49,700 --> 03:09:52,070
Wait a sec, guys

3564
03:09:52,070 --> 03:09:53,940
You set him up nicely

3565
03:09:53,940 --> 03:09:55,400
by asking about the toothpicks

3566
03:09:55,400 --> 03:09:56,540
Very natural

3567
03:09:58,370 --> 03:10:01,080
Gajiro Saito needs to be banned

3568
03:10:01,080 --> 03:10:03,210
I agree, Gaji san should be...

3569
03:10:03,210 --> 03:10:04,980
Well, I would be OK with his current photo

3570
03:10:04,980 --> 03:10:06,280
But not this one

3571
03:10:06,450 --> 03:10:09,550
It's his hair-cut

3572
03:10:08,050 --> 03:10:09,590
Agreed

3573
03:10:09,590 --> 03:10:10,820
Why the hell are you still in possession of that ?

3574
03:10:10,820 --> 03:10:12,420
That needs to be destroyed

3575
03:10:13,420 --> 03:10:15,620
Well, let me just put this away for now

3576
03:10:15,830 --> 03:10:17,760
I'm requesting an official "3 Laws of Non-Gajiro"

3577
03:10:24,230 --> 03:10:25,570
Here we go

3578
03:10:26,470 --> 03:10:27,770
Man...

3579
03:10:27,770 --> 03:10:28,600
I already can tell this will be bad

3580
03:10:28,600 --> 03:10:32,410
Instructor: Keiko Suzuki

3581
03:10:28,600 --> 03:10:32,510
The hotel receives many complaint calls on a daily basis

3582
03:10:33,580 --> 03:10:38,110
This video will assist you with complaint situations

3583
03:10:36,310 --> 03:10:37,880
I'm 100% sure who's in this

3584
03:10:38,010 --> 03:10:39,080
Of course

3585
03:10:39,350 --> 03:10:41,120
He's definitely in on this

3586
03:10:40,180 --> 03:10:44,350
Let's learn what to do when you receive a complaint call

3587
03:10:41,180 --> 03:10:42,350
Here he is again

3588
03:10:44,750 --> 03:10:48,720
Hotel Man
Saito san

3589
03:10:44,750 --> 03:10:48,720
Hotel Man
Suzuki san

3590
03:10:45,790 --> 03:10:49,460
Here are two Hotel Men who have agreed to be on camera

3591
03:10:51,330 --> 03:10:55,830
Hotel Woman
Onishi san

3592
03:10:52,290 --> 03:10:55,000
and a Hotel Woman, Onishi san

3593
03:10:54,330 --> 03:10:55,460
Amazing already

3594
03:11:01,200 --> 03:11:03,240
Hello, front desk

3595
03:11:03,910 --> 03:11:07,780
I just had one of the worst experiences dealing

3596
03:11:07,780 --> 03:11:09,950
with your concierge service

3597
03:11:09,350 --> 03:11:12,010
Kanshuji...

3598
03:11:09,910 --> 03:11:12,050
What kind of training are you guys providing ?

3599
03:11:12,050 --> 03:11:13,480
I see, it's Kanshuji ??

3600
03:11:14,720 --> 03:11:16,050
I'm talking about the Concierge

3601
03:11:19,150 --> 03:11:20,520
Here he comes

3602
03:11:21,220 --> 03:11:23,030
This isn't good

3603
03:11:23,130 --> 03:11:25,860
Why can't we watch the whole video first ?

3604
03:11:27,630 --> 03:11:29,270
Instead of coming in and out like this

3605
03:11:30,230 --> 03:11:34,000
We're in trouble if they're stopping the footage every time we laugh

3606
03:11:34,440 --> 03:11:36,140
What's "Kanshuji ?"

3607
03:11:36,140 --> 03:11:38,240
Don't recite him, Endo

3608
03:11:37,210 --> 03:11:38,240
Sorry about that

3609
03:11:39,010 --> 03:11:42,310
I'm talking about your Concierge

3610
03:11:40,340 --> 03:11:42,310
Kanshuji ?

3611
03:11:42,650 --> 03:11:49,150
Concierge

3612
03:11:46,120 --> 03:11:48,480
Kansho-jyu...

3613
03:11:48,480 --> 03:11:50,620
Kansho-jyu...

3614
03:11:50,620 --> 03:11:53,690
Kansho-jyu...

3615
03:11:53,690 --> 03:11:57,490
Kansho-jyu is...

3616
03:11:56,360 --> 03:12:01,700
Do you understand what a Concierge is ?

3617
03:11:58,760 --> 03:12:01,700
Of course, I do

3618
03:12:01,700 --> 03:12:05,070
Then tell me what it is

3619
03:12:05,070 --> 03:12:06,170
Well...Oh, I see it now

3620
03:12:06,170 --> 03:12:06,640
Well...Oh, I see it now

3621
03:12:06,640 --> 03:12:07,570
Well...Oh, I see it now

3622
03:12:07,570 --> 03:12:10,410
So You're saying

3623
03:12:10,970 --> 03:12:14,710
how you didn't care

3624
03:12:14,710 --> 03:12:15,410
um...about how you had felt

3625
03:12:15,410 --> 03:12:18,980
um...about how you had felt

3626
03:12:19,520 --> 03:12:20,980
What's he saying ?

3627
03:12:25,750 --> 03:12:27,690
What's he talking about ?

3628
03:12:28,990 --> 03:12:30,560
No more, please

3629
03:12:32,830 --> 03:12:34,500
That hurt

3630
03:12:34,500 --> 03:12:36,100
I'm really hating this

3631
03:12:36,100 --> 03:12:37,630
Seriously...

3632
03:12:37,830 --> 03:12:39,700
I demand an apology

3633
03:12:39,700 --> 03:12:42,640
I'm really sorry about this

3634
03:12:42,640 --> 03:12:45,980
and acknowledge how much I'm regretful about this

3635
03:12:46,210 --> 03:12:47,980
Can't you give a formal apology ?!

3636
03:12:48,110 --> 03:12:49,450
A formal apology ?

3637
03:12:50,610 --> 03:12:51,910
To never have this type of incident occur to...

3638
03:12:51,910 --> 03:12:53,550
To never have this type of incidentoccur to...

3639
03:12:53,550 --> 03:12:55,650
To never have this type of incident occur to...

3640
03:12:57,190 --> 03:12:58,720
On behalf of the store manager,

3648
03:13:17,870 --> 03:13:19,270
Why "store manager ?"

3649
03:13:23,250 --> 03:13:25,610
What an incredible person

3650
03:13:25,610 --> 03:13:27,550
He gets better and better every year

3651
03:13:31,820 --> 03:13:33,190
Hello, front desk here

03:13:43,400 --> 03:13:45,570
What is going on ?

3660
03:13:45,570 --> 03:13:48,740
What kind of training have you completed?

3661
03:13:48,740 --> 03:13:49,570
Well, I've taken some literature classes and

I've taken all the necessary courses

3666
03:13:58,180 --> 03:14:00,850
Aren't you a Hotel Man ?

3667
03:14:00,850 --> 03:14:02,690
Then tell me the 3 Rules of being a Hotel Man

3668
03:14:02,690 --> 03:14:05,720
Then tell me the 3 Rules of being a Hotel Man

3669
03:14:05,950 --> 03:14:06,490
Well, then I'm only gonna recite the First Rule

03:14:06,490 --> 03:14:11,390
Well, then I'm only gonna recite the First Rule

Can't he name all three ?

03:14:21,400 --> 03:14:23,570
Damn you...

3674
03:14:27,580 --> 03:14:28,940
My ass hurts

3675
03:14:30,880 --> 03:14:34,880
I'm only gonna recite the First Rule

3676
03:14:37,050 --> 03:14:43,090
Democracy of the people

3677
03:14:43,090 --> 03:14:49,630
by the people, and for the people-people

3678
03:14:52,370 --> 03:14:54,200
He's so unruly

3679
03:14:54,200 --> 03:14:55,540
This isn't good

3680
03:15:00,240 --> 03:15:02,380
Out of our hands

3681
03:15:06,980 --> 03:15:08,780
Hello, front desk

3682
03:15:08,950 --> 03:15:13,060
I've been really itchy since I checked into the hotel

3683
03:15:13,060 --> 03:15:14,660
Is it supposed to be bug-free in here ?

3684
03:15:15,090 --> 03:15:15,490
Well, everyday, well..

3685
03:15:15,490 --> 03:15:16,660
Well, everyday, well..

3686
03:15:16,660 --> 03:15:17,860
Well, everyday, well..

3687
03:15:17,860 --> 03:15:20,160
We're doing some spraying here

3688
03:15:20,430 --> 03:15:21,730
Well... I don't believe...

3689
03:15:21,730 --> 03:15:23,570
Well... I don't believe...

3690
03:15:23,570 --> 03:15:26,700
we're keeping any insects like that here

3691
03:15:27,440 --> 03:15:30,040
Whatever it is, help me get rid of this itchiness

3692
03:15:30,040 --> 03:15:32,570
Whatever it is, help me get rid of this itchiness

3693
03:15:33,710 --> 03:15:34,580
I...I'm assuming you're by the flowers

3694
03:15:34,580 --> 03:15:36,950
I...I'm assuming you're by the flowers

3695
03:15:36,950 --> 03:15:39,310
I...I'm assuming you're by the flowers

3696
03:15:39,310 --> 03:15:40,380
The flowers ?

3697
03:15:40,650 --> 03:15:43,320
What do I do with it ?

3698
03:15:43,990 --> 03:15:47,390
Hold onto it and then

3699
03:15:47,390 --> 03:15:49,830
Hold onto it and then

3700
03:15:49,860 --> 03:15:51,060
Yank off the petals one by one ?

3701
03:15:51,060 --> 03:15:52,690
Yank off the petals one by one ?

3702
03:15:52,690 --> 03:15:55,530
One petal at a time

3703
03:15:55,760 --> 03:16:01,370
Yank them off one petal at a time ?

3704
03:16:03,340 --> 03:16:05,340
Amazing

3705
03:16:04,370 --> 03:16:05,770
Just incredible

3706
03:16:11,380 --> 03:16:12,410
Impossible !

3707
03:16:12,610 --> 03:16:14,980
I'm expecting to be compensated

3708
03:16:14,980 --> 03:16:18,620
for all this trouble

3709
03:16:17,790 --> 03:16:18,620
Yes ?

3710
03:16:18,620 --> 03:16:20,660
Compensation

3711
03:16:20,660 --> 03:16:23,560
Are you seeing a doctor for this ?

3712
03:16:23,560 --> 03:16:28,500
I'm asking to be compensated !

3713
03:16:30,630 --> 03:16:33,440
Will this come out of my own pocket ?

3714
03:16:33,440 --> 03:16:35,840
To compensate her ?

3715
03:16:36,170 --> 03:16:38,410
If it's from my own pocket,

3716
03:16:38,410 --> 03:16:40,780
how does... $50 sound to you ?

3717
03:16:40,780 --> 03:16:43,650
how does... $50 sound to you ?

3718
03:16:43,650 --> 03:16:45,750
You're not really sorry about this, are you ?

3719
03:16:45,750 --> 03:16:46,880
Of course, I am

3720
03:16:46,880 --> 03:16:48,880
I don't think you're sorry enough !

3721
03:16:48,880 --> 03:16:49,350
Well, let me tell you what I have to do to get by these days

3722
03:16:49,350 --> 03:16:50,320
Well, let me tell you what I have to do to get by these days

3723
03:16:50,320 --> 03:16:52,290
Well, let me tell you what I have to do to get by these days

3724
03:16:52,290 --> 03:16:54,790
Well, let me tell you what I have to do to get by these days

3725
03:16:54,790 --> 03:16:56,260
Well, let me tell you what I have to do to get by these days

3726
03:16:56,260 --> 03:16:59,630
I had Onigiri (rice ball) with fish eggs and mayo

3727
03:16:59,630 --> 03:17:07,400
and also a sausage tempura

3728
03:17:07,400 --> 03:17:12,470
with a side of tuna for lunch today

3729
03:17:12,470 --> 03:17:15,140
So if you could find it in your heart

3730
03:17:15,140 --> 03:17:20,180
to cut me a deal between $50 to $100

3731
03:17:20,180 --> 03:17:20,520
I would appreciate it

3732
03:17:20,520 --> 03:17:22,450
I would appreciate it

3733
03:17:22,450 --> 03:17:23,590
Forget it, I'm asking for at least $1,000

3734
03:17:23,590 --> 03:17:25,350
Forget it, I'm asking for at least $1,000

3735
03:17:25,350 --> 03:17:27,890
I can't pay you $1,000

3736
03:17:27,890 --> 03:17:30,830
Can't you cough that up on your own ?

3737
03:17:30,830 --> 03:17:32,030
Well..

3738
03:17:32,030 --> 03:17:34,230
I suppose...

3739
03:17:34,230 --> 03:17:37,100
I can cancel my life insurance

3740
03:17:38,870 --> 03:17:40,200
Just amazing

3741
03:17:41,500 --> 03:17:44,310
He's one amazing character

3742
03:17:45,840 --> 03:17:47,540
I almost made it through

3743
03:17:49,810 --> 03:17:50,880
I was so close

3744
03:17:51,450 --> 03:17:53,520
Do you think that's the last we'll see of him ?

3745
03:17:53,520 --> 03:17:54,050
I know what you mean

3746
03:17:54,050 --> 03:17:56,290
No way he's done with us

3747
03:17:56,690 --> 03:17:58,320
I don't think Jimmy san is done with us yet

3748
03:17:58,320 --> 03:18:00,060
He'll come at us with something different

3749
03:18:00,060 --> 03:18:01,590
Absolutely

3750
03:18:04,830 --> 03:18:08,030
This is the busiest time to check people in

3751
03:18:08,060 --> 03:18:09,600
at the front desk

3752
03:18:09,600 --> 03:18:12,430
Why don't we go help them ?

3753
03:18:12,430 --> 03:18:13,700
Seriously ?

3754
03:18:14,100 --> 03:18:19,040
Helping the Front Desk

3755
03:18:14,800 --> 03:18:17,410
I can't tell what time of the day it is right now

3756
03:18:17,740 --> 03:18:19,310
But it doesn't feel like a busy time of day for a hotel

3757
03:18:19,310 --> 03:18:20,210
I'm feeling the gravity

3758
03:18:24,410 --> 03:18:27,150
I need all of you to get behind the front desk

3759
03:18:27,150 --> 03:18:29,280
How're we supposed to know what to do ?

3760
03:18:31,250 --> 03:18:34,390
Sit tight and patrons should start to show up

3761
03:18:36,890 --> 03:18:40,760
Checking in
Cobra & Lady
(Yuki Meguro)           (Obachan 1)

3762
03:18:46,470 --> 03:18:48,440
I have a reservation for two

3763
03:18:48,440 --> 03:18:50,240
My name is Cobra

3764
03:18:50,240 --> 03:18:52,570
Fill out this form ?

3765
03:18:51,510 --> 03:18:52,870
Yes, please

3766
03:18:56,550 --> 03:18:58,380
Never thought I'd see Cobra in real life

3767
03:18:58,680 --> 03:19:03,190
Lady rubs his butt

3768
03:18:59,950 --> 03:19:03,190
C O B R A, there, I did it

3769
03:19:03,550 --> 03:19:05,350
She wouldn't stop rubbing his ass

3770
03:19:05,350 --> 03:19:07,490
We all know woman like her, don't we ?

3771
03:19:07,260 --> 03:19:08,360
And my address ?

3772
03:19:16,260 --> 03:19:21,400
Psycho-Gun Goes Off !

3773
03:19:18,900 --> 03:19:21,300
That scared the hell out of me!

3774
03:19:21,500 --> 03:19:22,540
You ready, Lady ?

3775
03:19:24,170 --> 03:19:26,270
That really scared me

3776
03:19:31,180 --> 03:19:33,680
Damn you, Cobra

3777
03:19:46,360 --> 03:19:49,430
We have a reservation for three

3778
03:19:49,430 --> 03:19:51,600
We're the "Boing-ers"

3779
03:19:51,600 --> 03:19:54,200
We're here to protect peace on earth

3780
03:19:55,270 --> 03:19:56,740
May I ask who you are again ?

3781
03:19:56,870 --> 03:19:58,810
We're the BOING-ERS !

3782
03:19:56,870 --> 03:19:58,810
We're the BOING-ERS !

3783
03:19:56,870 --> 03:19:58,810
We'rethe BOING-ERS !

3784
03:20:03,180 --> 03:20:04,550
I've never heard of you before

3785
03:20:04,610 --> 03:20:06,210
Me neither

3786
03:20:06,520 --> 03:20:07,780
Our goal is to save the planet

3787
03:20:16,860 --> 03:20:17,890
Since there's no more male superheroes

3788
03:20:17,890 --> 03:20:18,690
Since there's no more male superheroes

3789
03:20:18,690 --> 03:20:19,800
Since there's no more male superheroes

3790
03:20:19,800 --> 03:20:20,960
Since there's no more male superheroes

3791
03:20:20,960 --> 03:20:22,800
we have taken on the role

3792
03:20:22,800 --> 03:20:23,830
Right, sisters ?

3793
03:20:23,830 --> 03:20:24,330
Yes

3794
03:20:24,330 --> 03:20:25,670
Yes

3795
03:20:33,440 --> 03:20:36,880
Here come the Villains

3796
03:20:39,850 --> 03:20:43,450
First rule is to sniffle our Boings

3797
03:20:43,450 --> 03:20:46,620
Second rule is to absorb an inexcusable Boing

3798
03:20:46,620 --> 03:20:55,000
And the third rule is to defeat all the ugly perverts

3799
03:20:55,000 --> 03:20:56,400
Boing-Rangers

3800
03:21:15,080 --> 03:21:18,050
Here's our chance, my sisters

3801
03:21:18,590 --> 03:21:20,220
Here's our finishing move

3802
03:21:20,220 --> 03:21:21,020
Boing-Galaxy

3803
03:21:20,220 --> 03:21:21,020
Boing-Galaxy

3804
03:21:21,020 --> 03:21:23,490
Boing-Galaxy

3805
03:21:21,020 --> 03:21:23,490
Boing-Galaxy

3806
03:21:27,060 --> 03:21:29,660
To call this entertainment is an insult

3807
03:21:31,730 --> 03:21:34,600
Villains disperse

3808
03:21:34,600 --> 03:21:36,970
Why don't we check in then ?

3809
03:21:39,470 --> 03:21:43,710
That kind of thing happens a lot ?

3810
03:21:42,410 --> 03:21:43,750
Sure

3811
03:21:43,710 --> 03:21:46,380
We don't get to see it at all

3812
03:21:44,880 --> 03:21:46,380
That's my first time as a matter of fact

3813
03:21:46,380 --> 03:21:47,780
Is that so ?

3814
03:21:48,180 --> 03:21:50,850
You know what, guys ?

3815
03:21:57,060 --> 03:21:58,260
What's so funny ?

3816
03:22:08,040 --> 03:22:09,040
Listen

3817
03:22:09,570 --> 03:22:13,740
You've been staring for a while

3818
03:22:12,840 --> 03:22:13,780
Excuse me ?

3819
03:22:13,780 --> 03:22:15,380
You're staring at our Boings

3820
03:22:15,380 --> 03:22:16,910
with your perverted eyes

3821
03:22:16,210 --> 03:22:16,950
No way, ma'am

3822
03:22:16,950 --> 03:22:17,810
I don't think so

3823
03:22:17,810 --> 03:22:19,010
Yes, you have, too !

3824
03:22:19,010 --> 03:22:20,150
Tomoko-san, men will always be men

3825
03:22:20,150 --> 03:22:23,250
Tomoko-san, men will always be men

3826
03:22:23,250 --> 03:22:25,950
Tomoko-san, why not tip them ?

3827
03:22:26,290 --> 03:22:28,390
Yes, I will

3828
03:22:31,590 --> 03:22:32,490
Man..

3829
03:22:32,490 --> 03:22:34,860
How do I not see that ?

3830
03:22:35,460 --> 03:22:39,130
Dollar bill

3831
03:22:40,600 --> 03:22:41,900
Hey

3832
03:22:41,900 --> 03:22:43,940
You moron

3833
03:22:43,940 --> 03:22:44,540
Yeah, you

3834
03:22:45,670 --> 03:22:46,470
Here

3835
03:22:47,640 --> 03:22:49,810
Get it with your mouth

3836
03:22:50,550 --> 03:22:51,510
How humiliating

3837
03:22:51,810 --> 03:22:54,480
You guys fight for justice, right ?

3838
03:22:54,480 --> 03:22:56,320
But you have such foul mouths

3839
03:22:56,320 --> 03:22:58,590
Not very superhero-like

3840
03:22:57,350 --> 03:22:58,590
Get your tip

3841
03:23:04,430 --> 03:23:05,730
Good job

3842
03:23:07,300 --> 03:23:09,860
Sister, are you OK ?

3843
03:23:09,860 --> 03:23:12,330
Sister, are you OK ?

3844
03:23:19,270 --> 03:23:21,480
She's got the giggles

3845
03:23:26,180 --> 03:23:29,380
Aren't you cold just standing here all night ?

3846
03:23:29,380 --> 03:23:30,920
Let me see your hand, please ?

3847
03:23:32,120 --> 03:23:34,090
Oh boy, his hand is freezing

3848
03:23:34,620 --> 03:23:39,460
Tomoko-san, you can warm him up, right ?

3849
03:23:41,530 --> 03:23:44,900
Hand warmer

3850
03:23:44,900 --> 03:23:47,570
Why not just give it to me ?

3851
03:23:47,700 --> 03:23:48,940
Hey !

3852
03:23:48,940 --> 03:23:50,770
Hey !

3853
03:23:50,770 --> 03:23:51,770
Here

3854
03:23:51,770 --> 03:23:53,740
Get it with your mouth

3855
03:23:56,040 --> 03:23:58,010
Man, you're gross

3856
03:23:58,010 --> 03:23:59,180
Yeah, you !

3857
03:23:59,710 --> 03:24:00,850
You're gross

3858
03:24:00,850 --> 03:24:03,050
Hurry up and get it

3859
03:24:03,950 --> 03:24:06,120
She's got such a potty mouth

3860
03:24:06,120 --> 03:24:08,120
How disgusting are you ?

3861
03:24:13,160 --> 03:24:14,300
Just get it

3862
03:24:14,660 --> 03:24:16,630
Just do it

3863
03:24:21,370 --> 03:24:22,740
We're so relieved

3864
03:24:23,670 --> 03:24:25,440
Shall we go now ?

3865
03:24:28,840 --> 03:24:31,510
Why is she one of them ?

3866
03:24:31,510 --> 03:24:33,550
She's the odd one out of the three

3867
03:24:33,920 --> 03:24:35,050
Yeah, that one in the yellow

3868
03:24:39,450 --> 03:24:40,590
Excuse me, but I've been looking for my golf bag

3869
03:24:40,590 --> 03:24:42,020
Excuse me, but I've been looking for my golf bag

3870
03:24:42,020 --> 03:24:43,890
Have you seen it ?

3871
03:24:48,460 --> 03:24:51,100
Don't come at me so serious

3872
03:24:51,530 --> 03:24:52,630
Look at his eyes, he's not messing around

3873
03:24:52,630 --> 03:24:54,870
Look at his eyes, he's not messing around

3874
03:24:57,870 --> 03:24:58,940
Golf bag ?

3875
03:25:00,440 --> 03:25:02,540
The golf bag has blue and white on it

3876
03:25:02,540 --> 03:25:03,280
Blue and white ?

3877
03:25:03,280 --> 03:25:04,280
Yes, sir

3878
03:25:05,350 --> 03:25:08,080
No one has reported that to us

3879
03:25:08,080 --> 03:25:11,420
I'm pretty sure I checked it in

3880
03:25:11,420 --> 03:25:12,250
Can you look it up ?

3881
03:25:12,950 --> 03:25:14,920
Oh, here it is

3882
03:25:15,460 --> 03:25:17,090
What a relief !

3883
03:25:21,260 --> 03:25:26,270
Saburou Ishikura is in the golf bag

3884
03:25:22,060 --> 03:25:23,670
Yes, this is my bag

3885
03:25:33,610 --> 03:25:35,340
Damn it

3886
03:25:35,480 --> 03:25:36,950
Is he supposed to be the 3-wood driver?

3887
03:25:38,910 --> 03:25:40,620
Thank you for your help

3888
03:25:42,420 --> 03:25:43,950
Why is he looking at us like that

3889
03:25:43,950 --> 03:25:44,550
He's so locked in on us

3890
03:25:44,550 --> 03:25:45,890
Locked in on us

3891
03:25:49,390 --> 03:25:51,790
I haven't seen a head cover made of wool in awhile

3892
03:25:52,190 --> 03:25:53,730
Yes, it was pretty old-school

3893
03:25:53,730 --> 03:25:58,570
I'm expecting a VIP anytime soon

3894
03:25:55,830 --> 03:25:57,330
Really ? I don't want it

3895
03:26:09,540 --> 03:26:13,720
VIP: M.C. Egar

3896
03:26:54,720 --> 03:26:56,560
Yes, we're all out

3897
03:27:02,430 --> 03:27:03,830
My ass hurts

3898
03:27:08,500 --> 03:27:09,340
Where is he ?

3899
03:27:09,870 --> 03:27:13,340
He took off without checking in

3900
03:27:13,510 --> 03:27:14,640
What was that all about ?

3901
03:27:14,710 --> 03:27:16,410
He was the VIP ?

3902
03:27:16,880 --> 03:27:21,350
12 hours have passed
Their shift is half way over

3903
03:27:21,350 --> 03:27:25,590
But there will be more laughing tricks and traps,
sending them into hell

3904
03:27:25,950 --> 03:27:27,560
We just saw footage from the wedding part

3905
03:27:28,120 --> 03:27:29,560
and Tomochika is definitely talented

3906
03:27:28,560 --> 03:27:33,530
Kazuo Nishio

3907
03:27:28,560 --> 03:27:33,530
Tomochika

3908
03:27:29,560 --> 03:27:31,130
Yes, she's good

3909
03:27:31,130 --> 03:27:32,860
with many skills

3910
03:27:33,860 --> 03:27:35,760
Who knew my brother would show up ?

3911
03:27:34,860 --> 03:27:43,270
Endo's brother

3912
03:27:34,860 --> 03:27:43,270
Jyunji-san

3913
03:27:35,760 --> 03:27:36,930
You guys don't look alike

3914
03:27:36,930 --> 03:27:37,900
No, not looks-wise

3915
03:27:37,900 --> 03:27:40,370
and he's definitely not the kind to horse around like that

3916
03:27:40,500 --> 03:27:43,100
He did a good job with "Ho-Ho-Hoi" skit

3917
03:27:44,170 --> 03:27:46,140
Right, and you had your annual...

3918
03:27:46,140 --> 03:27:48,280
Can we put an end to that ?

3919
03:27:46,370 --> 03:27:56,080
Chono's Slap

3920
03:27:48,280 --> 03:27:50,140
It seems as though it's become an annual event

3921
03:27:50,140 --> 03:27:51,510
An annual event ?

3922
03:27:51,510 --> 03:27:54,180
Then can he just come out and slap me

3923
03:27:54,180 --> 03:27:55,980
without all that hoopla leading up to it ?

3924
03:27:55,980 --> 03:28:00,120
Chono even muttered "every year"

3925
03:27:58,290 --> 03:28:00,120
Yes, he did

3926
03:28:00,120 --> 03:28:02,460
He said, "Your request gets more annoying every year"

3927
03:28:04,890 --> 03:28:08,530
It's been 13 hours since their work started

3928
03:28:09,330 --> 03:28:12,770
It might be time for their dinner

3929
03:28:15,000 --> 03:28:15,440
I would imagine Claudia is asleep by now

3930
03:28:15,440 --> 03:28:16,100
I would imagine Claudia is asleep by now

3931
03:28:15,670 --> 03:28:20,540
Claudia Umemiya as "Rocky"

3932
03:28:16,100 --> 03:28:18,570
I would imagine Claudia is asleep by now

3933
03:28:20,510 --> 03:28:21,110
Listen, guys

3934
03:28:21,110 --> 03:28:22,910
It's time for your dinner

3935
03:28:22,910 --> 03:28:25,310
Since you worked so hard today,

3936
03:28:25,310 --> 03:28:27,220
I've prepared gourmet meals for you

3937
03:28:28,080 --> 03:28:30,080
Thank you

3938
03:28:29,080 --> 03:28:30,080
Are we eating in here ?

3939
03:28:30,150 --> 03:28:31,090
Yes

3940
03:28:37,430 --> 03:28:39,360
I can tell this will be a pain in the ass

3941
03:28:40,330 --> 03:28:43,060
Why bring in these guys ??

3942
03:28:45,330 --> 03:28:47,040
Before I let you enjoy your dish

3943
03:28:47,040 --> 03:28:49,200
I need to tell you one of our chef's pet peeves

3944
03:28:49,200 --> 03:28:54,980
Garcon
Hiroaki Ogi   Ken Yahagi

3945
03:28:49,240 --> 03:28:52,570
which is to hear customers say "delicious"

3946
03:28:52,570 --> 03:28:54,980
which is to hear customers say "delicious"

3947
03:28:55,740 --> 03:28:58,510
Our chef is perfectly aware that his dish is "delicious"

3948
03:28:58,510 --> 03:29:02,850
so come up with other ways to compliment him

3949
03:29:03,020 --> 03:29:04,150
Well, let's pass these around then

3950
03:29:04,150 --> 03:29:05,950
I've got exceptional meals for each of you

3951
03:29:06,050 --> 03:29:07,390
Thank you very much

3952
03:29:07,490 --> 03:29:08,920
Thank you

3953
03:29:09,120 --> 03:29:11,530
Our chef is very proud of this dish

3954
03:29:11,530 --> 03:29:13,460
Go ahead and open it

3955
03:29:13,600 --> 03:29:15,800
Wow !

3956
03:29:13,600 --> 03:29:15,800
Wow !

3957
03:29:14,260 --> 03:29:15,800
What a gourmet meal !

3958
03:29:15,800 --> 03:29:17,500
Amazing

3959
03:29:17,930 --> 03:29:24,270
Top of the line Bento box made with only the best ingredients

3960
03:29:23,670 --> 03:29:30,310
But they must compliment the chef without the word "Delicious"

3961
03:29:30,310 --> 03:29:32,580
It's difficult not to use the word "Delicious"

3962
03:29:33,050 --> 03:29:35,120
Hamada-san, will you take a bite please ?

3963
03:29:35,520 --> 03:29:36,850
I'm going first ?

3964
03:29:36,850 --> 03:29:37,590
Please

3965
03:29:37,590 --> 03:29:40,460
I have to report back to the chef with your comments

3966
03:29:41,420 --> 03:29:42,520
How's this one ?

3967
03:29:43,260 --> 03:29:45,290
That is *Umaki

3968
03:29:45,330 --> 03:29:50,200
*Umaki is a roasted, skewered eel wrapped in a fried egg

3969
03:29:45,560 --> 03:29:47,960
OK, I'm trying this then

3970
03:29:46,030 --> 03:29:50,930
Umaki

3971
03:29:51,070 --> 03:29:53,030
How is it ?

3972
03:29:53,300 --> 03:29:55,300
Well...

3973
03:29:56,570 --> 03:29:59,540
I don't know how everyone else feels,

3974
03:29:59,540 --> 03:30:01,540
but I like it

3975
03:30:01,540 --> 03:30:03,480
Great flavor

3976
03:30:03,650 --> 03:30:05,310
I'd say that was OUT

3977
03:30:05,350 --> 03:30:06,510
What do you mean OUT ?

3978
03:30:07,150 --> 03:30:09,720
You need to be Butt-Slapped

3979
03:30:09,250 --> 03:30:10,120
Really ?

3980
03:30:10,080 --> 03:30:11,650
Serious ?

3981
03:30:11,650 --> 03:30:12,890
You're kidding ?

3982
03:30:16,920 --> 03:30:20,290
I didn't use the word, "Delicious"

3983
03:30:19,560 --> 03:30:21,600
I'm looking for nice, creative comments

3984
03:30:22,230 --> 03:30:24,530
It's hard to tell what the criteria is

3985
03:30:24,530 --> 03:30:25,870
We'll show you an example then

3986
03:30:25,100 --> 03:30:26,370
Yeah, let's see it

3987
03:30:26,370 --> 03:30:27,370
Take any of these, please

3988
03:30:27,640 --> 03:30:28,700
He's got the sashimi

3989
03:30:30,410 --> 03:30:38,350
Tuna sashimi

3990
03:30:34,910 --> 03:30:37,550
Ah !

3991
03:30:37,550 --> 03:30:37,750
Yes ! Yes ! Yes !

3992
03:30:37,750 --> 03:30:37,980
Yes ! Yes ! Yes !

3993
03:30:37,980 --> 03:30:39,380
Yes ! Yes ! Yes !

3994
03:30:40,750 --> 03:30:41,820
Ah...Pretty good !

3995
03:30:41,820 --> 03:30:43,320
Ah...Pretty good !

3996
03:30:45,990 --> 03:30:48,320
"Pretty good" is acceptable ??

3997
03:30:48,320 --> 03:30:49,790
What's going on here ?

3998
03:30:50,960 --> 03:30:52,390
I don't get the rules !

3999
03:30:52,690 --> 03:30:54,560
"Pretty good" is a safe phrase

4000
03:30:55,360 --> 03:30:58,900
Chef would be pleased to hear you say "Pretty good"

4001
03:30:58,900 --> 03:31:00,940
"Pretty good" ??

4002
03:31:01,040 --> 03:31:04,810
Tanaka-san, you look anxious to start

4003
03:31:03,340 --> 03:31:05,110
I'm going for this deep-fried crab thingy then

4004
03:31:05,110 --> 03:31:08,810
I'm going for this deep-fried crab thingy then

4005
03:31:08,440 --> 03:31:09,740
That's a great choice

4006
03:31:10,650 --> 03:31:18,220
Crab Croquette
w/ cream sauce

4007
03:31:11,110 --> 03:31:14,120
I'm impressed with the weight of it on my chopsticks

4008
03:31:14,720 --> 03:31:16,120
You like how it feels on your chopsticks ?

4009
03:31:16,120 --> 03:31:17,120
Chopsticks ?

4010
03:31:17,220 --> 03:31:19,150
Yes, on my chopsticks

4011
03:31:19,150 --> 03:31:20,460
I'm taking a bite

4012
03:31:23,120 --> 03:31:24,290
Wow, it is tender

4013
03:31:24,290 --> 03:31:27,530
with a copious amount of cream

4014
03:31:27,530 --> 03:31:31,000
I can appreciate the chef's choice of crab pieces

4015
03:31:31,000 --> 03:31:34,170
which can be enjoyed by all ages

4016
03:31:34,200 --> 03:31:36,440
And complimented well with fresh ingredients

4017
03:31:34,500 --> 03:31:37,110
Can't you make your comments shorter?

4018
03:31:43,980 --> 03:31:45,350
What the heck was that ?

4019
03:31:46,610 --> 03:31:48,450
(Tanaka-san) was OUT, too

4020
03:31:47,650 --> 03:31:48,750
Really ?

4021
03:31:52,250 --> 03:31:54,190
Don't you think that's too strict ?

4022
03:31:56,060 --> 03:31:58,390
Why don't you show them how it's done again ?

4023
03:31:57,020 --> 03:31:58,360
Yeah, show us again

4024
03:31:58,360 --> 03:32:01,200
What constitutes SAFE comments ?

4025
03:32:01,200 --> 03:32:02,760
His example didn't help us much

4026
03:32:03,360 --> 03:32:05,030
The job starts even before the first bite

4027
03:32:05,030 --> 03:32:06,200
Oh, I get it

4028
03:32:06,670 --> 03:32:07,870
I would say...

4029
03:32:09,040 --> 03:32:10,200
it's easy to pick up

4030
03:32:10,200 --> 03:32:11,340
I see, it's easy with chopsticks

4031
03:32:16,480 --> 03:32:19,910
Uneaten pieces fall off

4032
03:32:18,310 --> 03:32:19,810
That's nasty

4033
03:32:23,790 --> 03:32:26,050
Endo, did you have to point that out ?

4034
03:32:26,750 --> 03:32:27,660
I know

4035
03:32:27,660 --> 03:32:28,820
It was his fault

4036
03:32:29,720 --> 03:32:31,190
He's got zero manners

4037
03:32:32,490 --> 03:32:34,160
And it was before he even ate one

4038
03:32:34,900 --> 03:32:37,000
You cannot be dropping food like that

4039
03:32:38,100 --> 03:32:39,530
Yes Delicious !

4040
03:32:39,530 --> 03:32:40,670
Yes Delicious !

4041
03:32:40,300 --> 03:32:41,800
You just said "Delicious"

4042
03:32:41,800 --> 03:32:42,500
You just said it

4043
03:32:42,500 --> 03:32:43,500
You said it

4044
03:32:43,070 --> 03:32:44,840
No, I didn't

4045
03:32:44,340 --> 03:32:45,570
You did, too

4046
03:32:44,840 --> 03:32:45,870
No, I didn't

4047
03:32:46,140 --> 03:32:47,680
No way, I said it

4048
03:32:47,840 --> 03:32:49,240
What did you say then ?

4049
03:32:49,480 --> 03:32:51,850
I said "Magnificent"

4050
03:32:50,910 --> 03:32:51,850
"Magnificent ?"

4051
03:32:51,850 --> 03:32:54,350
I said "This crab is magnificent"

4052
03:32:54,350 --> 03:32:55,820
I thought you didn't like crab

4053
03:32:55,820 --> 03:32:57,050
I'm pretty sure you're not fond of crab

4054
03:32:58,490 --> 03:33:00,420
Matsumoto-san, I don't see you eating any yet

4055
03:33:00,420 --> 03:33:01,890
Of course, I haven't

4056
03:33:01,890 --> 03:33:03,260
I haven't touched any of it

4057
03:33:03,890 --> 03:33:05,730
Will you have some, please ?

4058
03:33:06,030 --> 03:33:10,630
Prawn

4059
03:33:06,160 --> 03:33:08,460
Oh !

4060
03:33:08,460 --> 03:33:11,900
I like the weight of this prawn

4061
03:33:11,900 --> 03:33:15,440
as well as its firmness

4062
03:33:15,440 --> 03:33:17,170
and its dynamism...

4063
03:33:24,880 --> 03:33:26,580
What is this all about ?

4064
03:33:27,150 --> 03:33:28,750
I thought I had it down

4065
03:33:30,890 --> 03:33:32,120
I started off great, didn't I ?

4066
03:33:33,250 --> 03:33:34,660
Yes, the way you started off was good

4067
03:33:36,620 --> 03:33:38,130
He was just gettin' started

4068
03:33:38,130 --> 03:33:39,730
He hadn't even taken a bite yet

4069
03:33:39,730 --> 03:33:41,600
Please continue

4070
03:33:43,360 --> 03:33:46,770
Check out its dynamism...

4071
03:33:48,500 --> 03:33:49,740
Sorry about that

4072
03:33:51,070 --> 03:33:53,110
What's "dynamism ?"

4073
03:33:56,910 --> 03:33:59,310
What do you mean by "dynamism ?"

4074
03:33:59,410 --> 03:34:02,920
Show them how it's done

4075
03:34:01,580 --> 03:34:02,920
Please, show us the proper way

4076
03:34:03,080 --> 03:34:04,150
I'd like to see the correct way

4077
03:34:04,290 --> 03:34:05,520
And don't drop any crumbs

4078
03:34:07,020 --> 03:34:07,590
How is it ?

4079
03:34:07,590 --> 03:34:10,290
Amazing !

4080
03:34:10,290 --> 03:34:11,930
Ah, it's grotesque

4081
03:34:11,930 --> 03:34:13,790
Ah, it's grotesque

4082
03:34:18,030 --> 03:34:19,770
Chef will be angry to hear that

4083
03:34:19,770 --> 03:34:21,270
How is that OK, and not my comment ?

4084
03:34:21,270 --> 03:34:22,200
I definitely did it right

4085
03:34:22,740 --> 03:34:25,070
Chef won't be happy to hear that

4086
03:34:25,540 --> 03:34:26,470
I complimented it !

4087
03:34:26,470 --> 03:34:29,380
He was merely emphasizing how the "prawn" looks

4088
03:34:28,210 --> 03:34:29,340
You know what else ?

4089
03:34:29,340 --> 03:34:31,310
You were inspired to use an English word

4090
03:34:31,310 --> 03:34:34,350
because of my previous comment

4091
03:34:33,080 --> 03:34:34,320
No way, no way

4092
03:34:34,750 --> 03:34:36,080
You're not to criticize us

4093
03:34:36,450 --> 03:34:38,950
Please, go ahead and enjoy your dinner

4094
03:34:39,390 --> 03:34:41,890
I still get this one ?

4095
03:34:40,420 --> 03:34:41,860
Yes, here's your chopsticks

4096
03:34:42,520 --> 03:34:47,160
Left over

4097
03:34:45,230 --> 03:34:47,030
I guess we're done with you guys

4098
03:34:47,160 --> 03:34:49,660
We'll see you guys

4099
03:34:49,660 --> 03:34:53,270
He messed up your dinner

4100
03:34:54,740 --> 03:34:59,210
It has been 14 and a half hours

4101
03:34:59,470 --> 03:35:01,980
Nothing hurts but my ass

4102
03:35:11,120 --> 03:35:13,790
Enjoy how Heipo has fared so far

4103
03:35:18,330 --> 03:35:19,330
Mmm !

4104
03:35:19,860 --> 03:35:20,860
Mmm !

4105
03:35:25,200 --> 03:35:27,300
Sigh~

4106
03:35:28,870 --> 03:35:31,170
He hasn't done anything today to be tired

4107
03:35:31,370 --> 03:35:33,340
What did he do today ?

4108
03:35:37,040 --> 03:35:37,580
Ah !

4109
03:35:37,580 --> 03:35:37,850
Ah, ah, ah, ah !

4110
03:35:37,850 --> 03:35:38,250
Ah, ah, ah, ah !

4111
03:35:38,250 --> 03:35:38,450
Ah, ah, ah, ah !

4112
03:35:38,450 --> 03:35:38,880
Ah, ah, ah, ah !

4113
03:35:38,880 --> 03:35:38,980
What ? what ? what ? what ? what ?

4114
03:35:38,980 --> 03:35:39,150
What ? what ? what ? what ? what ?

4115
03:35:39,150 --> 03:35:39,310
What ? what ? what ? what ? what ?

4116
03:35:39,310 --> 03:35:39,480
What ? what ? what ? what ? what ?

4117
03:35:39,480 --> 03:35:39,650
What ? what ? what ? what ? what ?

4118
03:35:39,650 --> 03:35:40,750
What's going on ?

4119
03:35:40,750 --> 03:35:40,980
What's going on ?

4120
03:35:40,980 --> 03:35:41,780
What's going on ?

4121
03:35:41,780 --> 03:35:43,180
C'mon, I was smoking a cigarette !

4122
03:35:43,180 --> 03:35:44,290
How about some lights ?

4123
03:35:44,290 --> 03:35:44,920
Lights !

4124
03:35:44,920 --> 03:35:46,720
C'mon, lights ! Cigarette !

4125
03:35:46,720 --> 03:35:46,890
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm~ !

4126
03:35:46,890 --> 03:35:47,050
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm~ !

4127
03:35:47,050 --> 03:35:47,220
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm~ !

4128
03:35:47,220 --> 03:35:47,620
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm~ !

4129
03:35:47,620 --> 03:35:48,060
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm~ !

4130
03:35:48,060 --> 03:35:49,620
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm~ !

4131
03:35:49,620 --> 03:35:50,890
Seriously !

4132
03:35:50,890 --> 03:35:52,590
Can I have some light, please

4133
03:35:52,590 --> 03:35:52,860
Hah, huh, mmm, mmm mmm~ !

4134
03:35:52,860 --> 03:35:53,260
Hah, huh, mmm, mmm mmm~ !

4135
03:35:53,260 --> 03:35:53,960
Hah, huh, mmm, mmm mmm~ !

4136
03:35:53,960 --> 03:35:55,630
Hah, huh, mmm, mmm mmm~ !

4137
03:35:56,830 --> 03:35:57,060
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm~ !

4138
03:35:57,060 --> 03:35:57,230
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm~ !

4139
03:35:57,230 --> 03:35:57,500
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm~ !

4140
03:35:57,500 --> 03:35:57,870
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm~ !

4141
03:35:57,870 --> 03:35:59,600
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm~ !

4142
03:35:59,600 --> 03:36:00,100
Ah ! Ah !

4143
03:36:00,100 --> 03:36:01,040
Ah ! Ah !

4144
03:36:01,040 --> 03:36:01,340
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm~ !

4145
03:36:01,340 --> 03:36:01,500
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm~ !

4146
03:36:01,500 --> 03:36:01,770
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm~ !

4147
03:36:01,770 --> 03:36:02,140
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm~ !

4148
03:36:02,140 --> 03:36:03,970
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm~ !

4149
03:36:04,670 --> 03:36:05,740
Ouch!!

4150
03:36:05,740 --> 03:36:06,640
Ha !

4151
03:36:06,640 --> 03:36:08,880
AHHHGGHH !!

4152
03:36:09,040 --> 03:36:11,710
That scared me...

4153
03:36:15,380 --> 03:36:17,950
He was trying to get light from sucking on cigarettes

4154
03:36:15,450 --> 03:36:20,320
*Members laughed already but will resume without any interruptions

4155
03:36:18,290 --> 03:36:19,750
Oh, I see

4156
03:36:21,190 --> 03:36:24,830
I am scared, that's right

4157
03:36:24,890 --> 03:36:27,500
I'm scared !

4158
03:36:27,560 --> 03:36:31,130
I'm scared, that's right

4159
03:36:28,630 --> 03:36:29,430
He's clearly lost it

4160
03:36:30,230 --> 03:36:31,630
I haven't seen him like this

4161
03:36:31,130 --> 03:36:33,270
I'm scared !

4162
03:36:36,600 --> 03:36:39,370
What am I to do ?

4163
03:36:39,370 --> 03:36:41,380
I hate this

4164
03:36:43,440 --> 03:36:44,450
Ding dong

4165
03:36:43,840 --> 03:36:44,410
Ah ! what ?!

4166
03:36:44,410 --> 03:36:45,750
Ah ! what ?!

4167
03:36:45,950 --> 03:36:47,250
What ?

4168
03:36:47,250 --> 03:36:49,450
What do you want ?

4169
03:36:49,450 --> 03:36:51,790
Good job

4170
03:36:52,320 --> 03:36:53,790
So far so good !

4171
03:36:55,020 --> 03:36:57,560
I thought you'd be hungry

4172
03:36:57,590 --> 03:36:58,460
Yes, I am

4173
03:36:58,460 --> 03:37:01,800
Here's some dinner for you

4174
03:37:00,760 --> 03:37:01,760
Thank you very much

4175
03:37:01,930 --> 03:37:03,760
Enjoy it

4176
03:37:03,760 --> 03:37:07,170
I'm too scared to open this lid

4177
03:37:05,430 --> 03:37:07,130
How can you be scared to open this ?

4178
03:37:07,130 --> 03:37:08,770
It looks freaky, doesn't it ?

4179
03:37:08,870 --> 03:37:09,640
Go ahead and open it

4180
03:37:09,640 --> 03:37:10,600
I'll stay here with you then

4181
03:37:10,600 --> 03:37:12,640
Go ahead and open it

4182
03:37:12,640 --> 03:37:14,940
Really, I owe you one

4183
03:37:15,110 --> 03:37:17,850
Open sesame !

4184
03:37:17,850 --> 03:37:20,510
What's this ?

4185
03:37:20,510 --> 03:37:22,420
Udon noodles ?

4186
03:37:21,080 --> 03:37:22,380
Yes, it is Udon noodles

4187
03:37:23,080 --> 03:37:24,950
OK, then

4188
03:37:25,150 --> 03:37:25,850
I'll be around

4189
03:37:25,850 --> 03:37:26,890
Go ahead and enjoy the meal

4190
03:37:27,960 --> 03:37:29,560
I'm digging in

4191
03:37:32,030 --> 03:37:35,000
Ah ! I broke it !

4192
03:37:35,000 --> 03:37:38,470
Do chopsticks break so easily ?

4193
03:37:42,500 --> 03:37:43,800
I guess I can still eat it

4194
03:37:44,110 --> 03:37:45,640
Ahhhh !!

4195
03:37:47,310 --> 03:37:49,940
Who ?

4196
03:37:50,780 --> 03:37:53,080
I don't feel like eating now...

4197
03:37:53,510 --> 03:37:56,150
My appetite has vanished now

4198
03:38:00,090 --> 03:38:02,960
Well, I take that back

4199
03:38:05,090 --> 03:38:07,060
Spice

4200
03:38:07,060 --> 03:38:09,300
Pours

4201
03:38:07,460 --> 03:38:09,330
Give me a break !

4202
03:38:10,830 --> 03:38:11,830
What the...

4203
03:38:12,730 --> 03:38:14,200
Oh boy...

4204
03:38:14,200 --> 03:38:15,640
That sucked

4205
03:38:17,810 --> 03:38:18,440
Ah !

4206
03:38:18,440 --> 03:38:20,770
There's something in it !

4207
03:38:20,770 --> 03:38:21,910
What is this ??

4208
03:38:22,010 --> 03:38:23,940
It's a cap ~ !

4209
03:38:23,940 --> 03:38:25,010
I see, it's the spice cap that fell in

4210
03:38:25,010 --> 03:38:27,010
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah !

4211
03:38:27,550 --> 03:38:29,020
What the hell's wrong with this guy ?

4212
03:38:32,490 --> 03:38:34,290
I'm OK with being out but...

4213
03:38:35,120 --> 03:38:38,130
That's a side of Heipo we haven't seen before

4214
03:38:42,000 --> 03:38:43,430
Ah~, this is getting painful

4215
03:38:43,430 --> 03:38:46,630
Ah~, this is getting painful

4216
03:38:45,570 --> 03:38:47,470
My ass had had it at this point

4217
03:38:55,180 --> 03:38:57,910

03:39:20,470 --> 03:39:22,040
My guest is Hideaki Onishi

4231
03:39:22,070 --> 03:39:23,240
Nice to meet you, sir

4232
03:39:23,240 --> 03:39:24,240
The pleasure is all mine

4233
03:39:24,770 --> 03:39:26,040
Please have a seat

4234
03:39:26,610 --> 03:39:34,010
Today's Guest

Political Commentator: Mr. Hideaki Onishi

4235
03:39:28,010 --> 03:39:33,250
Today's guest is political commentator, Mr. Hideaki Onishi

4236
03:39:34,280 --> 03:39:36,620
If you would go easy on me, I'd appreciate it, sir

4237
03:39:36,280 --> 03:39:41,390
Political Commentator

Hideaki Onishi

4238
03:39:36,620 --> 03:39:38,220
Same here, sir

4239
03:39:38,850 --> 03:39:41,420
Why don't we begin our discussion, Mr. Onishi,

4240
03:39:41,560 --> 03:39:48,430
of 2009 politics, economics, culture and legal cases

4241
03:39:46,430 --> 03:39:48,430
Nice freakin' face !

4242
03:39:48,430 --> 03:39:51,300
and approach them from every different angle.

4243
03:39:51,930 --> 03:39:55,440
But first, how would you

4244
03:39:55,440 --> 03:39:58,670
summarize 2009 ?

4245
03:40:00,870 --> 03:40:04,450
Sho

4246
03:40:04,450 --> 03:40:07,110
Sho ?

4247
03:40:09,880 --> 03:40:11,890
What the hell's up with his face ?

4248
03:40:12,020 --> 03:40:13,250
What stunned him just now ?

4249
03:40:13,250 --> 03:40:14,560
What got into him ?

4250
03:40:14,560 --> 03:40:16,160
Well, he sure stunned us

4251
03:40:19,790 --> 03:40:22,860
He thought he was supposed to summarize the year in one Kanji word

4252
03:40:22,860 --> 03:40:25,430
And the Kanji word he used referenced a new year

4253
03:40:25,630 --> 03:40:30,540
How would you summarize this past year ?

4254
03:40:32,770 --> 03:40:36,280
Sho

4255
03:40:36,280 --> 03:40:38,950
Sho ?

4256
03:40:40,080 --> 03:40:42,850
Let us move on to our first topic

4257
03:40:42,680 --> 03:40:43,180
OK

4258
03:40:43,220 --> 03:40:46,450
It involves turning Haneda Airport

4259
03:40:46,450 --> 03:40:48,790
into the main airport in the Tokyo area

4260
03:40:47,720 --> 03:40:48,820
Yes

4261
03:40:49,520 --> 03:40:56,000
What are your thoughts on Haneda becoming the main hub ?

4262
03:40:56,030 --> 03:40:57,630
Well...

4263
03:40:58,200 --> 03:40:59,000
The way I see it is

4264
03:40:59,000 --> 03:41:00,130
Well...

4265
03:41:01,270 --> 03:41:06,010
I'd say why not bring some *Habu (venomous snake)

4266
03:41:02,140 --> 03:41:21,190
*Habu is a venomous snake found in Okinawa area

4267
03:41:06,040 --> 03:41:08,910
from Okinawa

4268
03:41:09,080 --> 03:41:10,840
So that instead of having to go to Okinawa

4269
03:41:10,840 --> 03:41:13,250
to see Habu,

4270
03:41:13,250 --> 03:41:15,020
We can now see them in Haneda

4271
03:41:15,020 --> 03:41:17,790
once we build a Habu museum and such

4272
03:41:17,790 --> 03:41:21,490
I'd say we should go for it, yes

4273
03:41:22,490 --> 03:41:23,890
Well...

4274
03:41:24,020 --> 03:41:25,660
I'm not sure if we're talking about the same thing

4275
03:41:25,660 --> 03:41:28,060
I'm referencing the issue

4276
03:41:28,060 --> 03:41:31,870
of turning Haneda into the main hub

4277
03:41:31,870 --> 03:41:33,430
Are we both talking about the same issue ?

4278
03:41:34,340 --> 03:41:36,500
We're absolutely on the same page, sir

4279
03:41:39,770 --> 03:41:42,940
Well...

4280
03:41:42,940 --> 03:41:46,910
Your comment was well worth the listen

4281
03:41:46,910 --> 03:41:47,850
Thank you very much

4282
03:41:47,980 --> 03:41:49,020
Let us move on

4283
03:41:50,480 --> 03:41:52,750
The next topic involves dam-building

4284
03:41:53,950 --> 03:41:56,820
I'm talking about the Yamba Dam construction project

4285
03:41:56,820 --> 03:41:58,830
Of course, the country's in the midst of re-examining

4286
03:41:58,830 --> 03:42:00,830
many of our plans for dam construction

4287
03:42:00,830 --> 03:42:03,830
But as an expert of dam construction, Mr. Onishi,

4288
03:42:03,830 --> 03:42:07,630
I don't need to go too much into the details

4289
03:42:09,500 --> 03:42:11,370
And as an expert in this subject

4290
03:42:11,370 --> 03:42:13,540
I'd like to ask you to explain to our viewers

4291
03:42:13,540 --> 03:42:15,510
how a dam works

4292
03:42:15,510 --> 03:42:17,140
Just the basic Dam construction

4293
03:42:17,580 --> 03:42:20,310
Basic Dam construction ?

4294
03:42:18,950 --> 03:42:20,010
Yes

4295
03:42:20,310 --> 03:42:21,420
I'd appreciate if you could explain

4296
03:42:21,420 --> 03:42:23,420
the mechanics in simple terms

4297
03:42:23,980 --> 03:42:25,920
It's like me saying,

4298
03:42:25,920 --> 03:42:29,660
"Hey, I have to stop you right here"

4299
03:42:28,420 --> 03:42:29,660
Like this ?

4300
03:42:36,460 --> 03:42:38,470
He said "I gotta stop you here ?"

4301
03:42:38,930 --> 03:42:40,430
What's wrong with him ?

4302
03:42:46,270 --> 03:42:47,710
He's at it again...

4303
03:42:48,210 --> 03:42:49,540
I'd appreciate if you could explain

4304
03:42:49,840 --> 03:42:51,110
the mechanics in simple terms

4305
03:42:52,610 --> 03:42:54,010
It's like me saying,

4306
03:42:54,010 --> 03:42:56,350
"Hey, I have to stop you right here"

4307
03:42:56,350 --> 03:42:57,750
Like this ?

4308
03:42:58,850 --> 03:42:59,890
And when...

4309
03:43:01,420 --> 03:43:04,160
When it's a nice day outside and the water level goes down,

4310
03:43:04,160 --> 03:43:06,630
I can go, "Here, have some"

4311
03:43:06,630 --> 03:43:07,830
Like this ?

4312
03:43:07,830 --> 03:43:08,830
Sure

4313
03:43:10,330 --> 03:43:13,470
But here's where I think the problem lies

4314
03:43:14,740 --> 03:43:16,740
You cannot talk about Yamba Dam

4315
03:43:16,840 --> 03:43:19,240
without pointing out the projected cost

4316
03:43:21,380 --> 03:43:27,050
Back in 1986, the projected expense was 211 Billion Yen

4317
03:43:27,150 --> 03:43:28,480
However...

4318
03:43:28,820 --> 03:43:30,950
17 years later, in 2003,

4319
03:43:31,350 --> 03:43:33,290
the number jumped to 411 Billion Yen

4320
03:43:33,390 --> 03:43:34,660
Hah ~

4321
03:43:35,560 --> 03:43:39,290
With that in mind, I would like an expert opinion

4322
03:43:39,290 --> 03:43:41,090
as to why this increase happened

4323
03:43:41,090 --> 03:43:42,960
And also if you could give us an estimate

4324
03:43:42,960 --> 03:43:45,430
of the total expense in 2010

4361
03:44:33,010 --> 03:44:34,110
Well, no

4362
03:44:41,760 --> 03:44:43,720
I see that it's going up ?

4363
03:44:43,720 --> 03:44:46,030
Can I say it's a positively sloped graph ?

4364
03:44:46,030 --> 03:44:50,860
Yes, a Positive Slope Graph

4365
03:44:53,730 --> 03:44:55,140
This isn't fair

4366
03:44:56,170 --> 03:44:57,970
I'm getting tired of this

4367
03:45:04,680 --> 03:45:06,310
Please, let this be done soon

4368
03:45:06,810 --> 03:45:09,980
Do you understand anything about this Dam ?

4369
03:45:09,980 --> 03:45:11,320
Yes, of course

4370
03:45:12,820 --> 03:45:15,290
So it takes lots of money

4371
03:45:16,860 --> 03:45:18,290
If you could explain this to our viewers

4372
03:45:18,290 --> 03:45:21,860
by first pointing out the title of this graph

4373
03:45:22,000 --> 03:45:32,240
YAMBA DAM: CHANGE IN TOTAL EXPENSES

4374

Total #$%^$%

4378
03:45:32,570 --> 03:45:34,680
Well, let's analyze this graph then

4379
03:45:37,540 --> 03:45:44,220
First, total expense was at 211 Billion Yen

4380
03:45:44,220 --> 03:45:44,920
As an expert, don't you find this increase to be odd ?

4381
03:45:44,920 --> 03:45:47,550
As an expert, don't you find this increase to be odd ?

4382
03:45:48,260 --> 03:45:52,930
Well, I guess building a Dam...

4383
03:45:53,390 --> 03:45:54,190
Bump

4384
03:45:53,590 --> 03:45:54,960
I'm sorry

4385
03:45:54,900 --> 03:45:56,660
Ouch

4386
03:45:58,300 --> 03:46:02,740
Bump

4387
03:46:03,000 --> 03:46:04,710
What the hell ??

4388
03:46:05,970 --> 03:46:07,710
Damn it

4389
03:46:12,010 --> 03:46:13,510
This isn't good

4390
03:46:13,910 --> 03:46:15,980
That was a nice "bump"

4391
03:46:16,120 --> 03:46:20,790
Well, I guess building a Dam...

4392
03:46:21,250 --> 03:46:22,060
Bump

4393
03:46:22,760 --> 03:46:24,520
Ouch

4394
03:46:23,720 --> 03:46:24,630
I'm sorry

4395
03:46:24,590 --> 03:46:25,530
Please proceed

4396
03:46:25,530 --> 03:46:26,430
Sorry about that

4397
03:46:26,730 --> 03:46:28,360
Thank you for your explanation

4398
03:46:30,160 --> 03:46:31,600
Hah

4399
03:46:31,630 --> 03:46:32,270
I'm sorry about that

4400
03:46:34,130 --> 03:46:36,370
Is it OK if we move on to the next topic ?

4401
03:46:36,100 --> 03:46:40,240

Yes, let's move on

4404
03:46:44,540 --> 03:46:46,280

They are too exhausted to carry on a conversation

4407
03:47:08,370 --> 03:47:09,940
My ass...

4408
03:47:10,440 --> 03:47:12,610
I wanna go home

4409
03:47:14,170 --> 03:47:15,940
Yamasaki !

4410
03:47:15,940 --> 03:47:17,680
I got a gift for you

4411
03:47:17,680 --> 03:47:19,910
Why don't you come with me ?

4412
03:47:17,810 --> 03:47:19,880
What ?

4413
03:47:20,250 --> 03:47:21,280
Come get your gift

4414
03:47:21,150 --> 03:47:22,280
What's this all about ?

4415
03:47:22,280 --> 03:47:23,380
I don't want it

4416
03:47:23,380 --> 03:47:26,050
I don't need any gifts

4417
03:47:26,650 --> 03:47:29,360
What, you gotta go get it ?

4418
03:47:27,890 --> 03:47:28,920
Just me ?

4419
03:47:28,920 --> 03:47:29,560
Yes

4420
03:47:29,660 --> 03:47:31,860
Man, I'd be sketched out

4421
03:47:33,560 --> 03:47:34,860
I'm freaking out

4422
03:47:37,560 --> 03:47:41,330
Yamasaki is taken to...

4423
03:47:41,330 --> 03:47:44,400
You can go back once you're dressed

4424
03:47:44,400 --> 03:47:46,870
Wait a minute

4425
03:47:46,870 --> 03:47:48,010
What is this ?

4426
03:47:50,580 --> 03:47:52,480
When I just tried to look through the window

4427
03:47:52,480 --> 03:47:56,780
I couldn't see anything but I heard Heipo's voice

4428
03:47:56,780 --> 03:47:59,090
He's going "Ahhhhhhhhh !!"

4429
03:47:57,680 --> 03:47:59,120
Jeez

4430
03:48:00,750 --> 03:48:03,260
Something's going on in that shack

4431
03:48:01,350 --> 03:48:03,260
Yeah, there's something going on

4432
03:48:10,760 --> 03:48:12,700
What's with that small mustache ?

4433
03:48:17,700 --> 03:48:20,510
I'm freezing

4434
03:48:21,070 --> 03:48:23,680
No joke, I'm freezing

4435
03:48:28,220 --> 03:48:31,050
I was so determined NOT to
laugh at this point

4436
03:48:31,120 --> 03:48:34,490
Did you have to put on that small mustache ?

4437
03:48:41,960 --> 03:48:44,600
That is a one messed up gift

4438
03:48:45,070 --> 03:48:47,730
If you only knew how freezing this is...

4439
03:48:47,730 --> 03:48:50,670
And that damned face...

4440
03:48:49,240 --> 03:48:50,870
I was freezing

4441
03:48:59,310 --> 03:49:01,150
Can't you stand up straight ?

4442
03:49:01,980 --> 03:49:04,620
You guys were going down one by one

4443
03:49:05,390 --> 03:49:06,890
Freezing !

4444
03:49:07,650 --> 03:49:09,690
Those guys running by created a breeze, right ?

4445
03:49:09,960 --> 03:49:11,090
I'm sure you're freezing

4446
03:49:12,090 --> 03:49:16,330
Endo, Can you take my place ?

4447
03:49:13,060 --> 03:49:15,230
I'm sorry, but no

4448
03:49:16,330 --> 03:49:17,960
Please, switch with me

4449
03:49:18,370 --> 03:49:22,940
You don't understand, I was already cold this morning

4450
03:49:21,230 --> 03:49:22,940
This is...

4451
03:49:22,940 --> 03:49:24,240
something I really don't want to be a part of

4452
03:49:24,440 --> 03:49:26,340
Please, Tanaka !

4453
03:49:25,710 --> 03:49:26,370
No, no, no,

4454
03:49:26,370 --> 03:49:29,580
Sorry, but I cannot do this either

4455
03:49:29,580 --> 03:49:32,080
Why can't you ?

4456
03:49:32,750 --> 03:49:34,010
Seriously, I'm beggin you

4457
03:49:34,010 --> 03:49:34,780
Just put this on once,

4458
03:49:34,780 --> 03:49:36,220
and I'll take it back right away

4459
03:49:36,980 --> 03:49:39,020
He's lying

4460
03:49:37,880 --> 03:49:38,950
I agree

4461
03:49:39,720 --> 03:49:41,450
Man, I've been freezing all day !

4462
03:49:41,490 --> 03:49:42,390
I'm not kidding

4463
03:49:47,130 --> 03:49:49,360
Will you stop that comedic run-around ?

4464
03:49:49,030 --> 03:49:50,160
I'm not kiddin'

4465
03:49:50,200 --> 03:49:52,030
I wish you'd stop pacing around like that

4466
03:49:51,460 --> 03:49:52,800
Put something on top then

4467
03:49:52,800 --> 03:49:54,700
That might help you

4468
03:49:55,900 --> 03:49:56,900
Excuse me, Hosei-san

4469
03:49:58,510 --> 03:50:01,210
Can I see your underwear ?

4470
03:50:01,210 --> 03:50:03,280
I'm asking because you've worn some weird underwear before

4471
03:50:03,280 --> 03:50:04,380
You still got that on ?

4472
03:50:04,380 --> 03:50:05,610
I just got a glimpse of it

4473
03:50:06,250 --> 03:50:07,010
Are you serious ?

4474
03:50:07,710 --> 03:50:09,980
You put that on at home today, right ?

4475
03:50:09,950 --> 03:50:11,890
Can you pull down those tan-colored pants ?

4476
03:50:18,090 --> 03:50:20,690
Why are you being so timid ?

4477
03:50:22,660 --> 03:50:23,730
Why do you wear those ?

4478
03:50:23,730 --> 03:50:25,330
What kind of underwear are you wearing ?

4479
03:50:28,300 --> 03:50:30,200
Allow me to ask you why

4480
03:50:30,200 --> 03:50:30,940
Why not ?

4481
03:50:30,940 --> 03:50:32,270
There's nothing wrong with it

4482
03:50:32,740 --> 03:50:34,170
Yes, there IS something wrong with that

4483
03:50:35,480 --> 03:50:36,910
I'm beggin' you now

4484
03:50:36,910 --> 03:50:39,250
This jacket doesn't keep me any warmer

4485
03:50:39,250 --> 03:50:41,650
You didn't put it on

4486
03:50:42,250 --> 03:50:42,750
See ?

4487
03:50:42,750 --> 03:50:43,920
And it's kinda big on me

4488
03:50:45,550 --> 03:50:46,520
I'm beggin you, Endo

4489
03:50:46,190 --> 03:50:48,460
Why're you laughing ?

4490
03:50:47,720 --> 03:50:48,420
No, I didn't?

4491
03:50:48,460 --> 03:50:50,460
You just laughed

4492
03:50:50,690 --> 03:50:51,890
No, I didn't

4493
03:50:52,130 --> 03:50:52,990
No, this isn't cool

4494
03:50:52,860 --> 03:50:54,060
Why ?

4495
03:50:54,090 --> 03:50:54,730
Wait a sec

4496
03:50:55,100 --> 03:50:56,630
This is gonna suck

4497
03:50:57,030 --> 03:50:59,700
This is hell

4498
03:51:10,480 --> 03:51:12,880
That must've hurt without
any kind of protection

4499
03:51:12,880 --> 03:51:14,180
And you were cold, too

4500
03:51:20,590 --> 03:51:24,290
Hoesi-san, please pull up your pants

4501
03:51:22,690 --> 03:51:24,290
Seriously,

4502
03:51:24,290 --> 03:51:25,060
I am beggin you

4503
03:51:25,590 --> 03:51:26,260
I'm beggin'

4504
03:51:27,730 --> 03:51:28,330
Endo

4505
03:51:28,330 --> 03:51:28,800
No

4506
03:51:28,800 --> 03:51:31,060
Absolutely not

4507
03:51:29,830 --> 03:51:31,060
Hey !

4508
03:51:31,060 --> 03:51:33,400
I've just about had it !!

4509
03:51:38,270 --> 03:51:41,410
Your senior is on his knees begging you !!

4510
03:51:41,510 --> 03:51:42,810
No, you weren't on your knees

4511
03:51:48,210 --> 03:51:49,550
What's with you two ?

4512
03:51:48,420 --> 03:51:51,750
Cocorico needs to at least address their senior

4513
03:51:51,820 --> 03:51:53,820
Get over here !

4514
03:51:55,120 --> 03:51:55,990
That's it !

4515
03:51:56,560 --> 03:51:57,490
No more nonsense !

4516
03:51:57,490 --> 03:51:58,490
I'm not letting you off !

4517
03:51:58,490 --> 03:51:59,590
Yeah, you !!

4518
03:51:59,590 --> 03:52:00,830
I can't take...

4519
03:52:00,830 --> 03:52:03,000
I can't take this !!

4520
03:52:03,000 --> 03:52:04,330
Come

4521
03:52:04,330 --> 03:52:06,100
Come with me !

4522
03:52:06,270 --> 03:52:07,530
Can't you see your senior's begging ?

4523
03:52:07,600 --> 03:52:10,440
I understand your position but...

4524
03:52:10,440 --> 03:52:12,440
I'm begging you...

4525
03:52:18,950 --> 03:52:20,150
I understand your pain but...

4526
03:52:21,350 --> 03:52:22,080
I'm beggin'

4527
03:52:21,680 --> 03:52:22,280
I know I know

4528
03:52:22,820 --> 03:52:24,050
What about Endo ?

4529
03:52:24,050 --> 03:52:27,550
Shouldn't he be included, too ?

4530
03:52:26,220 --> 03:52:27,350
Of course, he is

4531
03:52:27,520 --> 03:52:28,490
You and I are both juniors to Yamasaki-san

4532
03:52:28,490 --> 03:52:30,720
Why don't the three of us go then ?

4533
03:52:30,720 --> 03:52:33,630
No, you just go with him

4534
03:52:31,390 --> 03:52:33,060
C'mon, let's go

4535
03:52:38,970 --> 03:52:40,500
I really don't think I can...

4536
03:52:39,870 --> 03:52:41,330
No, seriously...

4537
03:52:41,500 --> 03:52:43,140
I can't take this anymore

4538
03:52:46,240 --> 03:52:49,410
Let's think about what to do on your bottom half

4539
03:52:49,410 --> 03:52:53,480
Minor Change

4540
03:52:49,410 --> 03:52:55,480
Minor Change

4541
03:52:49,580 --> 03:52:52,250
Despite Endo's help,

4542
03:52:52,250 --> 03:52:56,050
they end up only modifying Yamasaki's costume

4543
03:52:59,190 --> 03:53:00,290
I bet you're still freezing

4544
03:53:04,920 --> 03:53:07,490
And I'm supposed to be a Hotel Man ?

4545
03:53:15,040 --> 03:53:16,400
You're definitely not a Hotel Man

4546
03:53:17,600 --> 03:53:19,070
You found something after all

4547
03:53:19,240 --> 03:53:23,010
But what kind of Hotel Man am I ?

4548
03:53:26,480 --> 03:53:30,480
This might help you stay warm

4549
03:53:30,480 --> 03:53:35,690
Chono's Eye Mask

4550
03:53:36,320 --> 03:53:41,390
At any case, why not wear that jacket when you go outside

4551
03:53:53,070 --> 03:53:54,510
He's definitely not a Hotel Man

4552
03:53:58,080 --> 03:53:59,180
You're kiddin'

4553
03:54:02,620 --> 03:54:05,290
I don't see the meaning of all this

4554
03:54:06,720 --> 03:54:08,920
None of these go together

4555
03:54:08,920 --> 03:54:10,660
when you lift the lid open

4556
03:54:14,060 --> 03:54:15,800
So this is a Hotel Man ?

4557
03:54:21,130 --> 03:54:23,640
Don't say stuff like " lift the lid open "

4558
03:54:24,140 --> 03:54:25,170
What do you mean by " lift the lid open ?"

4559
03:54:25,170 --> 03:54:27,540
What do you mean by " lift the lid open ?"

4560
03:54:31,310 --> 03:54:32,380
Can't you do anything for me ?

4561
03:54:32,380 --> 03:54:34,350
This is nonsense

4562
03:54:34,350 --> 03:54:40,250
If all else fails, just wrap this towel around your waist

4563
03:54:55,940 --> 03:54:57,440
I have to say...

4564
03:54:58,270 --> 03:54:59,510
You're becoming more and more

4565
03:54:59,510 --> 03:55:02,480
like a Hotel Man

4566
03:55:02,510 --> 03:55:03,940
I'm utterly lost right now

4567
03:55:04,280 --> 03:55:07,110
I'm starting to feel ill from this nonsense

4568
03:55:12,520 --> 03:55:15,360
People are gonna think I'm some kind of poser

4569
03:55:19,260 --> 03:55:20,590
What the hell ?

4570
03:55:22,960 --> 03:55:24,660
I wouldn't call you a poser

4571
03:55:28,170 --> 03:55:29,300
Hamada was laughing, too !!

4572
03:55:29,300 --> 03:55:30,200
Yes, he was

4573
03:55:31,840 --> 03:55:34,410
Zaki-san, could you somehow fix your outfit ?

4574
03:55:34,410 --> 03:55:38,210
And refrain from making comments about your appearance

4575
03:55:38,510 --> 03:55:40,650
Aren't your toes cold ?

4576
03:55:40,650 --> 03:55:41,210
Of course, they're cold

4577
03:55:41,210 --> 03:55:42,950
With your bare feet, I'm sure

4578
03:55:43,180 --> 03:55:44,120
Where're those gloves ?

4579
03:55:44,120 --> 03:55:45,990
I swear I've seen gloves around

4580
03:55:45,020 --> 03:55:45,990
Here they are

4581
03:55:48,560 --> 03:55:49,590
They're Matsumoto-san's

4582
03:56:01,630 --> 03:56:02,970
Anything goes at this point

4583
03:56:09,880 --> 03:56:11,140
He's just messing around

4584
03:56:16,150 --> 03:56:17,180
He's not serious enough

4585
03:56:17,180 --> 03:56:19,050
Get a hold of yourself !

4586
03:56:19,050 --> 03:56:21,390
You're doing this on purpose

4587
03:56:22,660 --> 03:56:24,890
You've gone too far with this

4588
03:56:26,590 --> 03:56:28,090
Of couse, he's OUT

4589
03:56:28,430 --> 03:56:30,460
You're screwing around too much

4590
03:56:31,830 --> 03:56:33,830
You've been laughing the whole time

4591
03:56:37,240 --> 03:56:39,410
Give me a break !

4592
03:56:42,640 --> 03:56:44,340
We need to negotiate

4593
03:56:44,340 --> 03:56:46,880
Listen, guys

4594
03:56:46,880 --> 03:56:48,780
As one of the top hotels

4595
03:56:48,780 --> 03:56:53,120
we have a blacklist of undesirable patrons

4596
03:56:53,690 --> 03:56:56,420
They're holding a meeting to put this list together right now

4597
03:56:56,560 --> 03:56:58,260
Wait, I need some clothes

4598
03:56:58,560 --> 03:57:00,830
Yamasaki, you're coming just like that

4599
03:56:59,730 --> 03:57:01,730
You're kiddin'

4600
03:57:01,860 --> 03:57:06,000
I'm definitely catching a cold

4601
03:57:09,570 --> 03:57:13,510
I'm afraid I'll be arrested looking like this

4602
03:57:13,540 --> 03:57:16,110
Endo can't wipe his smile off

4603
03:57:16,110 --> 03:57:20,580
Sorry, but I'm just embarrassed knowing HE's part of our group

4604
03:57:22,150 --> 03:57:22,920
Who's that guy ?

4605
03:57:23,720 --> 03:57:25,080
Tell me who that guy is

4606
03:57:25,950 --> 03:57:29,790
3F Conference Room

4607
03:57:38,460 --> 03:57:40,030
Look, these guys are even laughing

4608
03:57:40,900 --> 03:57:42,540
Sit in the order

4609
03:57:42,170 --> 03:57:43,770
They couldn't contain their laughter

4610
03:57:50,040 --> 03:57:52,980
Now that everyone is present

4611
03:57:52,980 --> 03:57:55,280
Let us begin with our blacklist conference

4612
03:57:55,450 --> 03:58:05,730
Blacklist Conference

4613
03:57:55,450 --> 03:58:05,730
To prevent problems,

List rude and abusive celebrities

4614
03:58:01,650 --> 03:58:06,230
Let's hear names of celebrities you know to be rude and abusive

4615
03:58:07,190 --> 03:58:08,160
Oh, you got one

4616
03:58:09,160 --> 03:58:11,530
This is about Hosei Yamasaki

4617
03:58:11,930 --> 03:58:20,240
Hosei Yamasaki Info

4618
03:58:13,830 --> 03:58:18,200
I heard that he's recently purchased a house

4619
03:58:17,370 --> 03:58:20,240
Purchased a House...

4620
03:58:18,710 --> 03:58:23,210
So when one comic asked him whether or not to invest in a house

4621
03:58:22,710 --> 03:58:35,050
Hosei Yamasaki Information

4622
03:58:22,710 --> 03:58:35,050
Purchased a House

4623
03:58:23,310 --> 03:58:23,880
Yamasaki gets weirdly excited and

4624
03:58:23,880 --> 03:58:26,780
he says, "All of you need to buy a house"

4625
03:58:26,810 --> 03:58:29,350
in a really high pitched voice

4626
03:58:29,380 --> 03:58:32,050
It's obvious he's trying to make people laugh,

4627
03:58:32,090 --> 03:58:34,090
but even the make-up person wasn't laughing

4628
03:58:38,830 --> 03:58:41,890
The judge's couldn't see you
laughing under that mask

4629
03:58:41,990 --> 03:58:43,730
I know, I was laughing the whole time, too

4630
03:58:48,900 --> 03:58:51,040
You got lucky with that

4631
03:58:51,500 --> 03:58:52,940
Anything else ?

4632
03:58:53,570 --> 03:58:55,710
There's this man named Masatoshi Hamada...

4633
03:58:55,940 --> 03:59:31,310
Masatoshi Hamada Information

4634
03:58:56,580 --> 03:58:59,310
he was hosting his TV show

4635
03:58:59,450 --> 03:59:02,850
where he showcases different festivals in Japan

4636
03:59:02,120 --> 03:59:30,640
Hamada's TV program "Festival"

4637
03:59:03,280 --> 03:59:05,180
And it showed this one festival

4638
03:59:05,180 --> 03:59:08,520
where it was the town's custom to offer rice cakes to their God

4639
03:59:08,520 --> 03:59:11,860
and then the townspeople get to scramble and fight for the rice cakes

4640
03:59:12,060 --> 03:59:14,030
And the question came up

4641
03:59:14,030 --> 03:59:15,900
"What would happen if someone grabbed some Mochi,

4642
03:59:15,900 --> 03:59:17,200
before they signaled OK ?"

4643
03:59:17,330 --> 03:59:19,030
And as we were about to answer,

4644
03:59:19,030 --> 03:59:20,830
Hamada said, "Don't bother with answers"

4645
03:59:20,830 --> 03:59:22,870
"Why not just do it ?!"

4646
03:59:22,870 --> 03:59:25,710
So one of the guests on the show went for the rice cake

4647
03:59:25,770 --> 03:59:27,270
before we were signaled a "go for it"

4648
03:59:27,440 --> 03:59:28,470
Then Hamada smacks his head with a bamboo stick

4649
03:59:28,470 --> 03:59:30,940
Then Hamada smacked his head with a bamboo stick

4650
03:59:36,680 --> 03:59:38,850
He sounds like a handful

4651
03:59:38,850 --> 03:59:40,290
Out of control

4652
03:59:46,860 --> 03:59:48,760
Get it together

4653
03:59:47,890 --> 03:59:48,760
No kiddin'

4654
03:59:55,270 --> 03:59:56,600
So he had a bamboo stick ?

4655
03:59:55,970 --> 04:00:10,650
Hamada's TV Program "Festival"

4656
03:59:55,970 --> 04:00:10,650
Masatoshi Hamada

4657
03:59:56,600 --> 03:59:58,440
Now, you would think it's over, right ?

4658
03:59:58,540 --> 03:59:59,870
Well, it wasn't because Hamada then said,

4659
04:00:00,010 --> 04:00:02,010
"You do it next, Katsumata !"

4660
04:00:02,610 --> 04:00:04,810
Of course, nobody objected to it

4661
04:00:04,810 --> 04:00:07,680
So I went to grab a rice cake,

4662
04:00:07,880 --> 04:00:08,850
only to be smacked by Hamada's bamboo stick

4663
04:00:08,850 --> 04:00:11,250
only to be smacked by Hamada's bamboo stick

4664
04:00:17,620 --> 04:00:19,660
He sounds out of hand

4665
04:00:26,230 --> 04:00:27,870
He should be listed on the blacklist then

4666
04:00:27,900 --> 04:00:29,170
Of course

4667
04:00:30,140 --> 04:00:32,270
I heard this from Inomoto

4668
04:00:31,500 --> 04:01:02,770
Masatoshi Hamada Information

4669
04:00:34,340 --> 04:00:36,740
It happened at a Golf course

4670
04:00:35,880 --> 04:01:02,770
At Golf Course...

4671
04:00:36,980 --> 04:00:39,550
where there's no caddy service

4672
04:00:39,550 --> 04:00:43,880
but instead, every player gets a navigation system on their golf cart

4673
04:00:44,250 --> 04:00:48,320
Unfortunately, Inomoto and his staff's navigation system wasn't working great

4674
04:00:48,860 --> 04:00:53,290
And they weren't sure what to do until Hamada-san came to help them

4675
04:00:53,630 --> 04:00:56,830
Hamada-san saw a "EXIT" button on navigation system and said

4676
04:00:57,100 --> 04:00:58,160
"Ah, why don't you press this EXCITING button ?"

4677
04:00:58,160 --> 04:01:01,330
"Ah, why don't you press this EXCITING button ?"

4678
04:01:01,730 --> 04:01:03,140
Exciting ??

4679
04:01:07,240 --> 04:01:09,040
I don't think anything should be excited at that moment

4680
04:01:09,610 --> 04:01:12,410
He didn't even question why an "EXCITING" button's there ?

4681
04:01:12,780 --> 04:01:14,610
That is a terrible mistake

4682
04:01:14,610 --> 04:01:15,750
He must be uneducated

4683
04:01:15,750 --> 04:01:17,780
Not educated

4684
04:01:19,890 --> 04:01:22,820
I also have heard one from Inomoto...

4685
04:01:25,290 --> 04:01:28,790
Hamada-san took some of the young comedians out

4686
04:01:25,490 --> 04:02:02,760
Masatoshi Hamada Information

4687
04:01:28,790 --> 04:01:32,130
to an expensive gourmet restaurant

4688
04:01:31,560 --> 04:02:02,760
At Gourmet Restaurant...

4689
04:01:33,830 --> 04:01:37,100
As they were about to enjoy their course meals

4690
04:01:37,100 --> 04:01:42,140
Hamada-san became very irritable after the appetizers

4691
04:01:42,140 --> 04:01:45,580
And no matter how much the comics continued to enjoy the meal,

4692
04:01:45,580 --> 04:01:47,680
Hamada-san just kept chain smoking looking irritated

4693
04:01:47,680 --> 04:01:48,680
Apparently, he went through two packs of cigarettes

4694
04:01:48,680 --> 04:01:51,520
Apparently, he went through two packs of cigarettes

4695
04:01:51,520 --> 04:01:54,020
So all the comics assumed Hamada-san wasn't into the meal

4696
04:01:54,050 --> 04:01:55,720
or didn't care for the service

4697
04:01:55,760 --> 04:01:57,660
But the truth was that

4698
04:01:57,660 --> 04:01:59,790
by the time the appetizers were served,

4699
04:01:59,790 --> 04:02:02,700
Hamada-san had crapped his pants

4700
04:02:09,600 --> 04:02:11,070
At a gourmet restaurant ?

4701
04:02:11,700 --> 04:02:13,740
Why did he crap his pants ?

4702
04:02:13,940 --> 04:02:15,840
How come ?

4703
04:02:17,510 --> 04:02:20,010
Isn't Hamada an adult ?

4704
04:02:20,050 --> 04:02:21,550
Yes, he's not a child

4705
04:02:21,650 --> 04:02:25,150
I heard he left a nice crap stain on the chair

4706
04:02:25,690 --> 04:02:27,020
Doesn't he know there's a bathroom ?

4707
04:02:27,450 --> 04:02:29,490
His butt had turned stupid

4708
04:02:29,620 --> 04:02:31,660
Let's discuss someone else

4709
04:02:31,690 --> 04:02:33,490
OK, I got one about Endo

4710
04:02:34,290 --> 04:02:37,300
This is unconfirmed but...

4711
04:02:34,590 --> 04:02:45,000
Shozo Endo Information

4712
04:02:37,360 --> 04:02:39,100
it's about his buttocks

4713
04:02:39,100 --> 04:02:43,370
He claims that a @#$%^ size bottle can easily fit into his ass

4714
04:02:39,100 --> 04:02:45,000
It's about his buttocks...

4715
04:02:49,140 --> 04:02:50,840
That's an OK size...

4716
04:02:53,480 --> 04:02:55,680
What ?! I would say that's huge

4717
04:02:56,080 --> 04:02:58,720
Anything about his better half, Tanaka ?

4718
04:02:58,720 --> 04:03:01,150
Tanaka...

4719
04:03:02,250 --> 04:03:04,560
I have no information about him

4720
04:03:04,120 --> 04:03:04,890
Me neither

4721
04:03:05,160 --> 04:03:05,990
Me neither

4722
04:03:05,690 --> 04:03:06,430
I got one

4723
04:03:07,590 --> 04:03:09,630
Oh, you got one on Tanaka ?

4724
04:03:10,130 --> 04:03:34,090
Naoki Tanaka Information

4725
04:03:11,060 --> 04:03:18,700
I heard this from one of the 3 comics

4726
04:03:18,740 --> 04:03:22,640
who worked with him on a TV sketch comedy show

4727
04:03:21,340 --> 04:03:34,020
At sketch comedy show

4728
04:03:22,740 --> 04:03:26,210
Evidently, they all had a great time shooting the show with Tanaka

4729
04:03:26,210 --> 04:03:29,220
Evidently, they all had a great time shooting the show with Tanaka

4730
04:03:29,220 --> 04:03:31,550
That's about it

4731
04:03:36,990 --> 04:03:38,690
So, he's a good guy

4732
04:03:38,790 --> 04:03:41,160
He doesn't belong on the list then

4733
04:03:42,730 --> 04:03:43,760
Sorry, my mistake

4734
04:03:45,000 --> 04:03:46,800
Yes, he's a good person

4735
04:03:49,740 --> 04:03:51,300
Excuse me but...

4736
04:03:51,640 --> 04:03:54,670
I've got a dirt on Junior Chihara

4737
04:03:53,470 --> 04:04:15,460
Junior Chihara Information

4738
04:03:54,710 --> 04:03:56,540
He used to stay at a hotel in Osaka

4739
04:03:56,540 --> 04:03:58,680
which is used by many local comedians

4740
04:03:57,510 --> 04:04:15,530
At a Hotel in Osaka

4741
04:03:58,680 --> 04:04:01,580
The hotel is known to be forgiving toward rowdy crowds

4742
04:04:01,580 --> 04:04:07,120
so they get business from young comics in town

4743
04:04:07,320 --> 04:04:08,890
Anyhow, when Junior stayed there,

4744
04:04:08,890 --> 04:04:12,190
he used so much lotion

4745
04:04:12,190 --> 04:04:15,260
that he was asked to purchase a new bed comforter

4746
04:04:20,970 --> 04:04:23,870
He must have used a crap load of lotion then

4747
04:04:28,240 --> 04:04:29,940
We're starting to get the ball rolling

4748
04:04:31,080 --> 04:05:03,610
Junior Chihara Information

4749
04:04:31,210 --> 04:04:40,720
Junior was having a heated argument with his elder brother in front of the monitoring camera

4750
04:04:37,420 --> 04:05:03,610
Argument with Brother

4751
04:04:40,720 --> 04:04:42,620
But none of the staff wanted to get involved

4752
04:04:42,690 --> 04:04:46,760
thinking they were arguing about their skit

4753
04:04:46,760 --> 04:04:48,890
But you could hear them saying things like

4754
04:04:49,060 --> 04:04:52,500
"No, you decide !", "No, you do it !"

4755
04:04:52,500 --> 04:04:58,300
It turned out that Junior received a gift from their aunt

4756
04:04:58,670 --> 04:05:03,040
and they were arguing about how to go about splitting it

4757
04:05:06,610 --> 04:05:08,110
And what was the outcome ?

4758
04:05:07,110 --> 04:05:08,150
I don't know

4759
04:05:09,050 --> 04:05:10,350
I'd love to know what happened

4760
04:05:17,820 --> 04:05:20,290
I've got a dirt on someone else

4761
04:05:20,260 --> 04:06:20,220
Matazou Mimata Information

4762
04:05:20,290 --> 04:05:21,190
This is about Matazou Mimata

4763
04:05:21,990 --> 04:05:24,730
He is in charge of *Takeshi's Apartment Complex

4764
04:05:23,600 --> 04:06:20,220
Manages Takeshi's Apartment Complex...

4765
04:05:24,730 --> 04:05:27,000
By the way, this apartment complex is only occupied

4766
04:05:24,730 --> 04:05:28,730
*Takeshi Kitano aka "Beat" Takeshi is a well known comedian and a film writer and director

4767
04:05:26,970 --> 04:05:29,900
by Takashi's Fan Groups visiting from England, France, and Italy

4768
04:05:29,900 --> 04:05:33,410
And he lets them stay there for free

4769
04:05:33,410 --> 04:05:38,680
as a token of Takeshi's gratitude to his overseas fans

4770
04:05:39,410 --> 04:05:43,050
Anyway, Matazou Mimata is supposed to manage this complex

4771
04:05:44,220 --> 04:05:46,590
But all Takeshi fans say the same thing

4772
04:05:46,590 --> 04:05:51,620
after they express how much they enjoyed their stay in Japan

4773
04:05:52,990 --> 04:05:56,000
" I don't ever want to stay in that apartment complex again "

4774
04:05:56,830 --> 04:05:58,530
They all had a great time meeting Takeshi-san

4775
04:05:58,530 --> 04:05:59,870
and sightseeing in Japan

4776
04:05:59,870 --> 04:06:02,540
But they don't like the apartment complex

4777
04:06:02,540 --> 04:06:05,770
There must be something fishy going on there

4778
04:06:05,770 --> 04:06:09,010
I'm suspecting foul play by the manager

4779
04:06:09,010 --> 04:06:11,140
Of course, you had no idea about this but...

4780
04:06:11,310 --> 04:06:12,710
Ita....#$%   An Italian....

4781
04:06:13,450 --> 04:06:16,950
How come you stuttered just now?

4782
04:06:23,590 --> 04:06:26,130
He wanted to say Italian, but couldn't

4783
04:06:33,070 --> 04:06:34,830
Here's one about Hitoshi Matsumoto

4784
04:06:34,830 --> 04:06:38,200
when he went back to Osaka for the summer

4785
04:06:35,330 --> 04:06:46,550
Hitoshi Matsumoto Information

4786
04:06:38,600 --> 04:06:46,550
Summer in Osaka...

4787
04:06:39,370 --> 04:06:41,710
It must have something to do with just getting married,

4788
04:06:41,740 --> 04:06:42,780
but when we went to the Karaoke bar,

4789
04:06:42,780 --> 04:06:45,610
He did not let go of his microphone until 5am

4790
04:06:49,850 --> 04:06:51,280
What a jerk !

4791
04:06:51,920 --> 04:06:55,150
Well, I didn't know he was like that

4792
04:06:59,090 --> 04:07:01,490
That's very uncharacteristic of him

4793
04:07:01,890 --> 04:07:04,630
He seems to be really into the lotion

4794
04:07:01,930 --> 04:07:19,910
Hitoshi Matsumoto Information

4795
04:07:04,530 --> 04:07:19,910
Lotion...

4796
04:07:04,930 --> 04:07:06,730
And he always carries it in his bag

4797
04:07:06,930 --> 04:07:09,000
Like a portable one ?

4798
04:07:09,000 --> 04:07:10,440
Yes, when he has to travel far for work

4799
04:07:10,440 --> 04:07:12,840
This one time, the cap came off the bottle

4800
04:07:12,840 --> 04:07:14,610
and it went all over his bag

4801
04:07:15,910 --> 04:07:19,250
So he quickly threw @#$% in that bag

4802
04:07:19,980 --> 04:07:21,580
He didn't want to be wasteful

4803
04:07:21,610 --> 04:07:23,050
Amazing

4804
04:07:25,080 --> 04:07:25,950
He wanted to salvage the loss

4805
04:07:28,790 --> 04:07:31,520
Eco-Bag !

4806
04:07:33,630 --> 04:07:35,790
We don't want that bag brought here

4807
04:07:36,760 --> 04:07:40,000
Ok, I'm continuing with Hitoshi Matsumoto information

4808
04:07:39,770 --> 04:08:07,190
Hitoshi Matsumoto Information

4809
04:07:40,600 --> 04:07:43,770
We all know that he just had his first child

4810
04:07:41,530 --> 04:08:07,190
Not good

4811
04:07:44,000 --> 04:07:45,840
So any time we're out drinking,

4812
04:07:45,840 --> 04:07:51,040
he would pull out his phone to show everyone a photo of his daughter

4813
04:07:51,880 --> 04:07:56,180
But the screen dims when the phone's idle for a while, right ?

4814
04:07:56,180 --> 04:07:58,720
So when one of the younger comics said,

4815
04:07:58,720 --> 04:08:00,650
" Oh, she's very cute "

4816
04:08:00,750 --> 04:08:01,750
Matsumoto-san goes,

4817
04:08:01,750 --> 04:08:03,960
" No, look at it with the lights on "

4818
04:08:05,060 --> 04:08:06,890
That's not good

4819
04:08:09,800 --> 04:08:12,200
He insists on showing it to you in the best condition

4820
04:08:13,030 --> 04:08:14,570
He sure has changed

4821
04:08:14,570 --> 04:08:16,900
Because you can still see the photo on dim, right ?

4822
04:08:16,270 --> 04:08:16,900
Of course

4823
04:08:16,900 --> 04:08:19,310
But he kept pushing the (Cell phone's) button to activate the light

4824
04:08:20,110 --> 04:08:22,780
I almost don't want to see him like that

4825
04:08:25,610 --> 04:08:26,950
Haven't you had enough ?

4826
04:08:26,950 --> 04:08:27,580
Let's go back

4827
04:08:29,480 --> 04:08:31,320
Shall we ?

4828
04:08:32,280 --> 04:08:34,450
But we were just getting started

4829
04:08:40,990 --> 04:08:47,030
17 Straight Hours of Work


Their strength and willpower are about to end!!

4830
04:08:47,500 --> 04:08:53,170
The exhausted members



ppppppprrrrrrrrbbbbbbbbrrrrrrpppppwill face more sneaky attacks

4831
04:08:53,670 --> 04:08:55,870
The climactic ending is near...

4832
04:08:55,940 --> 04:08:58,310
You can't go wrong with Jimmy-san

4833
04:08:58,380 --> 04:08:59,580
What an amazing character

4834
04:08:59,580 --> 04:09:01,880
He was particularly great this year

4835
04:09:02,980 --> 04:09:04,480
We mentioned this before but,

4836
04:09:04,480 --> 04:09:06,420
what was up with your costume change ?

4837
04:09:06,420 --> 04:09:08,090
It had nothing to do with the program

4838
04:09:08,090 --> 04:09:10,020
Maybe a spin-off ?

4839
04:09:10,120 --> 04:09:12,830
Your costume was the reason for a lot of my beatings

4840
04:09:12,830 --> 04:09:15,890
But as the costume wearer, you didn't get any butt slaps

4841
04:09:15,890 --> 04:09:17,500
Well, no, I got my share of slaps

4842
04:09:17,560 --> 04:09:19,370
No, not really

4843
04:09:20,030 --> 04:09:23,370
It's your fault for wearing that thong

4844
04:09:23,370 --> 04:09:26,640
What's wrong with wearing a thong ?

4845
04:09:26,640 --> 04:09:27,370
You have one on today, too ?

4846
04:09:27,570 --> 04:09:28,470
Today...?   Yes

4847
04:09:28,470 --> 04:09:29,340
Today...?   Yes

4848
04:09:29,680 --> 04:09:31,880
So you're serious

4849
04:09:33,110 --> 04:09:34,410
But why ?

4850
04:09:34,410 --> 04:09:36,320
Well, it makes my butt look nice

4851
04:09:36,320 --> 04:09:37,080
Well, it makes my butt look nice

4852
04:09:37,080 --> 04:09:40,250
Well, it makes my butt look nice

4853
04:09:38,980 --> 04:09:41,250
And who are you trying to impress ?

4854
04:09:41,250 --> 04:09:42,150
So you're into anything "beautiful"

4855
04:09:42,150 --> 04:09:43,220
Yes, "beautiful"

4856
04:09:42,620 --> 04:09:43,660
The "Beauty" of things

4857
04:09:43,660 --> 04:09:44,360
Yes, the "Beauty"

4858
04:09:44,490 --> 04:09:46,760
You're just repeating whatever I say !!

4859
04:09:47,690 --> 04:09:50,260
Taking extreme measures in the hotel business

4860
04:09:50,300 --> 04:09:52,660
even at midnight

4861
04:09:53,800 --> 04:09:59,510
An End-of-the-Year Party is being held right now

4862
04:09:59,510 --> 04:10:01,310
I thought we should show our faces

4863
04:10:01,340 --> 04:10:03,010
Shall we ?

4864
04:10:03,080 --> 04:10:04,580
I don't get it

4865
04:10:04,980 --> 04:10:08,780
Who are these party goers


the men have been assigned to serve?

4866
04:10:08,780 --> 04:10:11,620
What kind of people start a party at midnight ?

4867
04:10:16,460 --> 04:10:18,760
Go ahead and sit in order

4868
04:10:26,070 --> 04:10:27,930
This will be a fun night

4869
04:10:28,930 --> 04:10:30,770
We long for this night every year

4870
04:10:30,800 --> 04:10:35,170
Here we are, the "Hand Towel" group, for our year end party

4871
04:10:35,170 --> 04:10:38,610
Hand-Towel Group


Hiroiki Ariyoshi

4872
04:10:35,170 --> 04:10:38,840
To start the occasion, let's hear from our chairman

4873
04:10:38,840 --> 04:10:39,750
Yes

4874
04:10:40,010 --> 04:10:40,810
Chairman !

4875
04:10:40,710 --> 04:10:42,650
Hand-Towel Group Chairman


Ryuhei Ueshima

4876
04:10:45,650 --> 04:10:48,790
I'd like to make a toast to our group

4877
04:10:48,790 --> 04:10:50,290
for making great strides this year

4878
04:10:50,290 --> 04:10:55,430
Of course, this couldn't have been possible without all of you

4879
04:10:56,260 --> 04:10:57,730
Cheers !

4880
04:10:58,360 --> 04:11:00,330
Kanpai !!

4881
04:11:09,680 --> 04:11:11,040
Without further adieu,

4882
04:11:11,040 --> 04:11:15,110
Let us being our annual gift exchange !

4883
04:11:16,150 --> 04:11:17,850
What can I get this year ?

4884
04:11:17,980 --> 04:11:20,250
OK, here's the first gift

4885
04:11:20,250 --> 04:11:21,720
It's called the "Firefly Set"

4886
04:11:21,720 --> 04:11:23,820
It's called the "Firefly Set"

4887
04:11:22,750 --> 04:11:24,020
Who brought this "Firefly Set" ??

4888
04:11:24,420 --> 04:11:25,320
I did

4889
04:11:25,620 --> 04:11:26,360
Oh, you did ?

4890
04:11:27,760 --> 04:11:29,130
What's a "Firefly Set" all about ?

4891
04:11:29,130 --> 04:11:31,130
All you do is place it on your butt

4892
04:11:29,130 --> 04:11:33,630
Hand-Towel Group


Nozomu Iwao

4893
04:11:31,130 --> 04:11:33,600
and you can transform into a Firefly

4894
04:11:33,600 --> 04:11:36,070
I want it~ !!

4895
04:11:35,630 --> 04:11:37,700
I definitely want this

4896
04:11:38,570 --> 04:11:40,670
OK, let me pick the winning raffle ticket

4897
04:11:40,970 --> 04:11:41,910
Give it to me

4898
04:11:42,210 --> 04:11:43,040
Give it to me

Pick me

4900

Hand-Towel Group

Osamu Shitara

4902
04:11:48,010 --> 04:11:49,180
I'm jealous

4903
04:11:49,680 --> 04:11:50,620
You're lucky

4904
04:11:51,080 --> 04:11:52,180
I got it ?

4905
04:11:53,090 --> 04:11:55,090
If you would lie down in the middle of the room

4906
04:11:55,350 --> 04:12:04,260
FIREFLY SETvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv


Light the flammable object on one's butt

to create a firefly !

4907
04:11:59,990 --> 04:12:00,890
That's cute

4908
04:12:01,290 --> 04:12:02,330
This is it

4909
04:12:03,960 --> 04:12:05,330
See, it's this easy

4910
04:12:06,370 --> 04:12:08,430
What do you do know ?

4911
04:12:08,430 --> 04:12:09,770
Is this OK...?

4912
04:12:11,100 --> 04:12:12,000
Here we go

4913
04:12:12,340 --> 04:12:13,570
I'm so jealous

4914
04:12:16,780 --> 04:12:17,640
Light it up

4915
04:12:20,680 --> 04:12:21,380
Light it up

4916
04:12:22,950 --> 04:12:24,250
Yeah, firefly !

4917
04:12:29,050 --> 04:12:31,360
Chairman, your turn !

4918
04:12:31,360 --> 04:12:32,320
I can try this, too ?

4919
04:12:32,320 --> 04:12:37,860
A Firefly for the Chairman

4920
04:12:36,430 --> 04:12:38,060
Can you set me up then ?

4921
04:12:38,100 --> 04:12:39,330
If you don't mind

4922
04:12:39,330 --> 04:12:40,370
It sure looked great

4923
04:12:42,940 --> 04:12:47,640
Set it up under his underwear !

4924
04:12:46,210 --> 04:12:47,570
How's this ?

4925
04:12:47,810 --> 04:12:49,310
Here we go !

4926
04:12:50,340 --> 04:12:51,610
Here it is, Chairman

4927
04:12:59,920 --> 04:13:00,650
It got lit

4928
04:13:00,390 --> 04:13:01,350
Splash him

4929
04:13:01,390 --> 04:13:02,320
Yes, it did

4930
04:13:01,550 --> 04:13:03,390
Splash him

4931
04:13:05,190 --> 04:13:08,090
That felt awesome !

4932
04:13:16,770 --> 04:13:23,410
*The fire self-extinguished and the Chairman's butt is OK

4933
04:13:21,640 --> 04:13:22,340
That stinks !

4934
04:13:22,370 --> 04:13:23,940
I smell something burnt

4935
04:13:24,240 --> 04:13:26,410
I'm glad you got to do it, Chairman

4936
04:13:26,410 --> 04:13:28,910
Was it pretty ?

4937
04:13:27,150 --> 04:13:28,880
Yes, it was

4938
04:13:28,880 --> 04:13:28,910
Very pretty

4939
04:13:28,910 --> 04:13:32,220
We're fortunate to catch a firefly this time of the year

4940
04:13:32,220 --> 04:13:34,390
Let's get going

4941
04:13:34,920 --> 04:13:38,520
The second gift is the "Stag Beetle Piercing"

4942
04:13:38,520 --> 04:13:39,790
Who picked this ?

4943
04:13:39,790 --> 04:13:40,860
That's me

4944
04:13:40,490 --> 04:13:41,260

Five members transition to the 3rd Floor of the Main Building

"Don't be scared" - What is their task ??

5139
04:23:17,300 --> 04:23:22,370
Today marks the day of our original owner's passing

5140
04:23:22,370 --> 04:23:24,080
And as new hotel men,

5141
04:23:24,080 --> 04:23:27,080
I ask you to bring the offering bowl

5142
04:23:27,080 --> 04:23:27,810

04:23:32,550 --> 04:23:38,890
What kind of tricks await them ?!

5146
04:23:39,090 --> 04:23:41,760
This is the first time we've gone together

5147
04:23:41,790 --> 04:23:42,790
Let's go

5148
04:23:43,560 --> 04:23:46,060
Just follow the directions

5149
04:23:46,060 --> 04:23:47,830
Tanaka, why don't you lead us ?

5150
04:23:47,430 --> 04:23:50,370
All the lighting has been changed

5151
04:23:50,500 --> 04:23:52,370
You'd do better with all of us together, right ?

5152

Countdown to the
CO2 Gas release

5153
04:23:52,400 --> 04:23:53,640
Yeah, I'll be OK

5154
04:23:54,840 --> 04:23:55,910
Tanaka, since you're the tallest...

5155
04:24:03,750 --> 04:24:06,450
That scared me...

5156
04:24:08,320 --> 04:24:12,390
That hurt my heart just now

5157
04:24:13,290 --> 04:24:15,290
Tanaka, lead us !

5158
04:24:15,730 --> 04:24:18,530
You know you'll be falling on your butt

5159
04:24:17,560 --> 04:24:19,230
you'll be safer in the front

5160
04:24:19,660 --> 04:24:23,430

5161
04:24:20,200 --> 04:24:20,970

Keep your voice down,

5165
04:24:25,470 --> 04:24:28,710
KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN !

5166
04:24:29,240 --> 04:24:30,040
We're going down, right ?

5167
04:24:31,940 --> 04:24:33,140
Yes, I believe so

5168
04:24:33,240 --> 04:24:35,080
Seriously, no yelling

Going down to the basement, right ?

Kuidaore (Gluttony) Doll (Height 145cm)

5173
04:24:42,590 --> 04:24:45,920

5174
04:24:47,660 --> 04:24:49,360
Seriously scary

5175
04:24:50,300 --> 04:24:52,200

This isn't OK

5179
04:25:09,380 --> 04:25:12,150
Not good

5180
04:25:12,350 --> 04:25:14,120
You can't fit in here

5181
04:25:14,220 --> 04:25:15,120
She's staring at me

5182
04:25:15,190 --> 04:25:17,920
A serious stare

5183
04:25:20,220 --> 04:25:23,730
At Elevator

5184
04:25:20,690 --> 04:25:21,730
Here we are

5185
04:25:24,000 --> 04:25:24,300

Why ? Why ? Why ?

5188
04:25:25,930 --> 04:25:27,500
Oh, we need to go to the basement

5189
04:25:27,700 --> 04:25:28,900
But we're at the lobby

5190
04:25:29,070 --> 04:25:30,670
Get off here then ?

Ah, let's go this way then

5194
04:25:40,510 --> 04:25:42,610
What the hell is she babbling ?

5195
04:25:43,880 --> 04:25:45,280
Wasn't that                    really freaky ??

5196
04:25:45,280 --> 04:25:47,990
Wasn't that                    really freaky ??

5197
04:25:46,920 --> 04:25:48,220
Yes, really creepy

5198
04:25:48,220 --> 04:25:52,760
I thought she was gone, and then I saw she was staring at me

5199
04:25:52,760 --> 04:25:54,830
It almost made my heart stop

5200
04:25:57,400 --> 04:25:59,130
Tanaka, get to the front

5201
04:25:59,130 --> 04:26:01,100
And I'll follow all of you guys

5202
04:26:03,670 --> 04:26:04,870

04:26:07,310 --> 04:26:09,070
There's someone in there

5206
04:26:07,940 --> 04:26:09,040
Is that Sandwich Man duo?

5207
04:26:09,070 --> 04:26:15,310
Sandwich Man in the midst of a skit meeting

What are they doing here, damn it

04:26:28,490 --> 04:26:30,260
That's scary

5211
04:26:30,130 --> 04:26:31,500
I see they wanted to get us bad

5212
04:26:31,730 --> 04:26:33,060
Really bad

He's not even scary

5219
04:26:48,680 --> 04:26:49,350
Should we beat him up ?

5220
04:26:49,350 --> 04:26:50,550
For real

04:26:58,660 --> 04:27:01,230
What do we do in the basement ?

5227
04:27:01,260 --> 04:27:04,100
We're supposed to get the offering

5228
04:27:04,760 --> 04:27:06,400
and bring it from the basement to the ground level ?

5229
04:27:06,400 --> 04:27:08,200
How does he expect us to remember everything

5230
04:27:08,200 --> 04:27:10,900

It's moving fast and stuff

5237
04:27:24,820 --> 04:27:26,320
Will you look at it ?

5238
04:27:31,120 --> 04:27:34,060
That is one scary thing

5239
04:27:36,190 --> 04:27:39,600

Get up, Tanaka

5259
04:28:35,520 --> 04:28:38,220
Of course, we'd had enough of you at this point

5260
04:28:39,490 --> 04:28:40,890
What now, Tanaka ?

5261
04:28:40,990 --> 04:28:42,460
Go that way !

similar to the story between Yokota Jaguar and Mr. Kinoshita

5312
04:30:16,550 --> 04:30:17,960
Doctor ?

5313
04:30:17,260 --> 04:30:18,920
Yes ?

5314
04:30:19,220 --> 04:30:21,090
I need to talk to you about something

5315
04:30:21,230 --> 04:30:22,990
Sorry, I have to take this call

5316
04:30:23,390 --> 04:30:24,360
Hello ?

5317
04:30:24,360 --> 04:30:26,230
Oh, Akiko-chan is here with me

5318
04:30:26,360 --> 04:30:27,370
What ?

5319
04:30:27,370 --> 04:30:29,030
Akiko-chan is dead ?

5320
04:30:29,130 --> 04:30:30,600
The operation didn't go well ??

5321
04:30:30,600 --> 04:30:32,670
But Akiko-chan is......

5322
04:30:32,940 --> 04:30:36,240
I'm taking you with me !

5323
04:30:36,970 --> 04:30:38,880
All of you guys, be careful !!

5324
04:30:38,910 --> 04:30:41,050
Thank you very much

5325
04:30:47,120 --> 04:30:50,550
You're watching another infomercial

5326
04:30:47,890 --> 04:30:52,420
Beauty Kokubu

5327
04:30:50,720 --> 04:30:52,790
And here's what you can order tonight !

5328
04:30:52,990 --> 04:30:57,930
It's a 47 inch high-definition TV

5329
04:30:58,100 --> 04:31:01,500
The picture quality is so clear

5330
04:31:01,500 --> 04:31:04,340
and check out its stylish body !!

5331
04:31:04,600 --> 04:31:05,870
And that's not all

5332
04:31:05,870 --> 04:31:09,370
I'm throwing in a Blue-Ray disk player

5333
04:31:09,740 --> 04:31:11,540
as well as this set of speakers

5334
04:31:11,980 --> 04:31:14,350
with a TV stand

5335
04:31:14,610 --> 04:31:17,080
You just pay one price for all four items

5336
04:31:17,680 --> 04:31:19,420
You can't get this deal anywhere else

5337
04:31:19,680 --> 04:31:22,190
but here

5338
04:31:22,950 --> 04:31:24,660
Now, how much would you pay for this ?

5339
04:31:24,590 --> 04:31:27,860
Countdown to a "secret" trap

5340
04:31:24,660 --> 04:31:29,330
Well, you'll have to find out in tomorrow's morning paper

5341
04:31:29,790 --> 04:31:34,200
Air from his hands

5342
04:31:35,130 --> 04:31:43,310
Grabs his feet

5343
04:31:40,600 --> 04:31:41,710
Wait !

5344
04:31:41,710 --> 04:31:42,570
WAIT !!

5345
04:31:42,570 --> 04:31:43,940
WAIT !!

5346
04:31:43,910 --> 04:31:45,180
What's going on ?

5347
04:31:49,750 --> 04:31:50,680
That was insane

5348
04:31:50,250 --> 04:31:50,920
Wait a minute

5349
04:31:50,920 --> 04:31:51,780
That sucked

5350
04:31:51,780 --> 04:31:53,580
That guy had my feet the whole time

5351
04:31:53,580 --> 04:31:55,650
He had my feet

5352
04:31:55,650 --> 04:31:57,960
I was freakin' scared !!

5353
04:31:59,460 --> 04:32:00,960
I didn't know what you meant

5354
04:32:01,030 --> 04:32:03,530
That sucked

5355
04:32:04,130 --> 04:32:05,700
I see another entrance

5356
04:32:05,800 --> 04:32:07,230
I'm sure we have to go in there

5357
04:32:07,370 --> 04:32:09,230
Go ahead

5358
04:32:09,230 --> 04:32:10,740
I see an arrow

5359
04:32:14,210 --> 04:32:16,370
What is this, Hamada-san ??

5360
04:32:16,370 --> 04:32:19,240
Who are you trying to be ??

5361
04:32:20,640 --> 04:32:27,520
Enter this way

5362
04:32:21,450 --> 04:32:23,110
Man, I see another door

5363
04:32:23,850 --> 04:32:25,420
This is taking too long

5364
04:32:27,620 --> 04:32:29,690
Tanaka, will you go, please

5365
04:32:28,850 --> 04:32:31,520
It's the scariest when I have to open (a door)

5366
04:32:31,790 --> 04:32:36,830
Countdown to the "Intro Music"

5367
04:32:39,660 --> 04:32:41,430
Oh, I see it's over there

5368
04:32:39,900 --> 04:32:43,230
Offering

5369
04:32:43,670 --> 04:32:46,000
What does that say ?

5370
04:32:46,000 --> 04:32:51,210
Take this offering

5371
04:32:47,100 --> 04:32:49,570
It says "Take this offering"

5372
04:32:49,970 --> 04:32:51,810
Oh yes, we need to take that to the ground level

5373
04:32:51,810 --> 04:32:52,580
What's this mean ?

5374
04:32:52,580 --> 04:32:53,410
Do I have to take this sign ?

5375
04:32:53,410 --> 04:32:55,010
No, no

5376
04:32:55,010 --> 04:32:57,680
It means you have to take that offering with that plate

5377
04:32:56,310 --> 04:33:00,280
Countdown to the CO2 Gas release

5378
04:32:58,680 --> 04:33:00,280
Take the whole bowl of fruits

5379
04:33:05,520 --> 04:33:06,990
What the ......

5380
04:33:08,690 --> 04:33:12,800
All the Characters Arrive !!

5381
04:33:16,400 --> 04:33:18,140
I can't keep going like this

5382
04:33:17,840 --> 04:33:19,270
I just saw bunch of them

5383
04:33:19,270 --> 04:33:20,300
A whole bunch

5384
04:33:20,300 --> 04:33:21,340
What is this ? What is this ?

5385
04:33:21,340 --> 04:33:22,470
What is this ? What is this ?

5386
04:33:22,510 --> 04:33:25,940
Matsumoto kept pushing me just now

5387
04:33:26,610 --> 04:33:28,850
I can't hold this

5388
04:33:30,610 --> 04:33:33,680
You know I'm going to drop them all !

5389
04:33:32,250 --> 04:33:35,150
I just saw all the scary characters coming at us

5390
04:33:35,320 --> 04:33:36,350
I'm suffering

5391
04:33:37,460 --> 04:33:38,390
I'm suffering !

5392
04:33:37,960 --> 04:33:38,760
I got a headache

5393
04:33:38,990 --> 04:33:40,590
This is impossible

5394
04:33:39,420 --> 04:33:40,960
The odds are against me

5395
04:33:40,960 --> 04:33:43,730
And I'm suffering

5396
04:33:43,730 --> 04:33:45,230
I'm suffering

5397
04:33:44,230 --> 04:33:45,630
You'll be fine

5398
04:33:45,230 --> 04:33:46,500
I'm really suffering !

5399
04:33:46,860 --> 04:33:49,030
It's light outside

5400
04:33:47,030 --> 04:33:52,100
Basement      Ground level

5401
04:33:51,470 --> 04:33:52,600
That was scary

5402
04:33:53,000 --> 04:33:58,380
Matsumoto wasn't shy about pushing me around

5403
04:33:55,870 --> 04:34:00,180
"Get on the cart"

5404
04:33:56,870 --> 04:33:58,440
You would've done the same

5405
04:33:58,480 --> 04:34:00,140
I was so scared

5406
04:34:01,310 --> 04:34:03,280
We all gotta get on this cart

5407
04:34:03,280 --> 04:34:05,480
It's so bright outside

5408
04:34:05,480 --> 04:34:08,190
We don't need this flashlight anymore

5409
04:34:08,250 --> 04:34:09,490
Get on it quickly

5410
04:34:13,160 --> 04:34:14,390
Let's go

5411
04:34:18,330 --> 04:34:22,330
Drive to the Grounds

5412
04:34:23,630 --> 04:34:25,570
Here comes something

5413
04:34:25,570 --> 04:34:29,570
Here comes the Jiang Shi !!

5414
04:34:28,540 --> 04:34:30,440
Is this the same girl we saw in the elevator ?

5415
04:34:34,380 --> 04:34:36,280
She must be the same girl

5416
04:34:42,090 --> 04:34:43,720
It's getting cold

5417
04:34:43,720 --> 04:34:45,620
Yeah, it's cold

5418
04:34:52,260 --> 04:34:53,630
Here we are

5419
04:34:56,630 --> 04:34:58,600
Don't forget to bring the offering

5420
04:34:57,230 --> 04:35:00,570
Countdown to a "secret" trap

5421
04:34:57,870 --> 04:34:58,600
Yes

5422
04:35:00,270 --> 04:35:01,670
I see an arrow

5423
04:35:06,780 --> 04:35:08,550
So we meet again

5424
04:35:08,550 --> 04:35:12,150
Yutaro emerges from a pile of leaves

5425
04:35:08,850 --> 04:35:10,250
How annoying is that guy ?

5426
04:35:13,320 --> 04:35:16,950
Tanaka, you've dropped too much fruit

5427
04:35:17,350 --> 04:35:21,830
Forget about all the grapes !

5428
04:35:21,830 --> 04:35:25,460
Wow, amazing

5429
04:35:27,060 --> 04:35:29,030
Is that it ?

5430
04:35:27,870 --> 04:35:33,400
The monument

5431
04:35:30,130 --> 04:35:31,800
I've got a bad feeling about this

5432
04:35:31,800 --> 04:35:33,400
Me too

5433
04:35:35,170 --> 04:35:38,080
Something's really freaky about this

5434
04:35:38,080 --> 04:35:43,310
I say don't stray from the cones

5435
04:35:40,510 --> 04:35:43,280
Definitely not

5436
04:35:45,420 --> 04:35:48,750
Tanaka, since you've got the offering......

5437
04:35:48,750 --> 04:35:52,760
Man, the banana's smushed

5438
04:35:53,860 --> 04:35:56,190
What's here anyhow ?

5439
04:35:58,560 --> 04:35:59,860
Over there ?

5440
04:36:00,660 --> 04:36:02,470
What a long walk

5441
04:36:03,470 --> 04:36:06,440
We've passed the point of no return

5442
04:36:09,370 --> 04:36:11,680
Why don't you go put that bowl over there ?

5443
04:36:11,910 --> 04:36:14,310
Yeah, in the opening underneath

5444
04:36:15,550 --> 04:36:17,250
Yeah, right there

5445
04:36:29,190 --> 04:36:31,530
Please accept our offering

5446
04:36:32,100 --> 04:36:33,160
Let's go back

5447
04:36:32,430 --> 04:36:36,370
Countdown to a "secret" trap

5448
04:36:33,160 --> 04:36:34,260
That should do it

5449
04:36:45,680 --> 04:36:53,480
Hattori Militia + Series of Huge Explosions

5450
04:37:03,360 --> 04:37:05,160
I felt the heat

5451
04:37:06,800 --> 04:37:08,470
Who fell down there ?

5452
04:37:08,800 --> 04:37:11,270
Tanaka, that's you again ?!

5453
04:37:11,470 --> 04:37:13,400
You were still falling on your ass!

5454
04:37:16,270 --> 04:37:19,480
Puddle

5455
04:37:20,780 --> 04:37:23,650
Tanaka, you're so helpless

5456
04:37:21,050 --> 04:37:23,650
I hate this !

5457
04:37:26,480 --> 04:37:29,620
It's been 21 hours since the start

5458
04:37:32,020 --> 04:37:35,430
We screamed so much

5459
04:37:34,320 --> 04:37:36,430
My voice has just about had it

5460
04:37:39,960 --> 04:37:43,930
We couldn't have finished without each other

5461
04:37:42,500 --> 04:37:43,930
Agreed

5462
04:37:43,930 --> 04:37:45,700
Imagine just the two of you at night ?

5463
04:37:46,240 --> 04:37:47,240
Sandwich Man was scary

5464
04:37:46,240 --> 04:37:51,540
"No Face" Sandwich Man

5465
04:37:47,240 --> 04:37:49,710
even though I knew who they were

5466
04:37:48,040 --> 04:37:49,870
That was scary

5467
04:37:50,040 --> 04:37:52,380
I don't like that kind of stuff

5468
04:37:52,780 --> 04:37:54,340
I'd say the scariest was when that guy grabbed my feet

5469
04:37:54,810 --> 04:37:58,650
If that happened when I was in middle-school,

5470
04:37:58,650 --> 04:38:02,350
I would have soiled my pants for sure

5471
04:38:02,350 --> 04:38:04,960
You're just laughing like nobody's business

5472
04:38:07,120 --> 04:38:11,560
It's been 21 hours of straight work

5473
04:38:07,120 --> 04:38:11,560
They have no more strength to give

5474
04:38:12,260 --> 04:38:19,440
Despite having no strength nor will left to spare,

5475
04:38:16,770 --> 04:38:19,440
one final task remains

5476
04:38:19,640 --> 04:38:21,540
Listen guys

5477
04:38:21,540 --> 04:38:25,140
There's a patron who refuses to leave the sauna room,

5478
04:38:25,440 --> 04:38:28,180
Could you give us a hand ?

5479
04:38:28,210 --> 04:38:29,050
At this hour ?

5480
04:38:29,280 --> 04:38:30,510
What a nutcase

5481
04:38:30,610 --> 04:38:32,280
Whoever refuses to leave the sauna

5482
04:38:32,280 --> 04:38:34,120
should be charged for a full night's stay

5483
04:38:34,180 --> 04:38:40,620
Before their work day is over,


the members perform their last task

5484
04:38:41,330 --> 04:38:46,160
Bath

5485
04:38:41,460 --> 04:38:42,860
What a pain in the ass

5486
04:38:45,660 --> 04:38:46,600
Sauna ?

5487
04:38:47,600 --> 04:38:49,070
Here it is

5488
04:38:49,130 --> 04:38:50,870
The patron's still in here

5489
04:38:51,170 --> 04:38:53,270
If possible, talk her out of there

5490
04:38:51,800 --> 04:38:53,070
Oh, man.....

5491
04:38:53,770 --> 04:38:56,570
Who is this ??

5492
04:38:56,510 --> 04:38:57,810
Excuse us

5493
04:38:59,910 --> 04:39:01,080
Oh God

5494
04:39:01,180 --> 04:39:02,880
Oh, man !

5495
04:39:04,310 --> 04:39:09,950
Half-Naked Ohshima from "Morisanchu"

5496
04:39:08,790 --> 04:39:09,950
Well.....

5497
04:39:10,150 --> 04:39:11,820
It's time for us to close the sauna

5498
04:39:11,820 --> 04:39:13,160
Could you leave now, please ?

5499
04:39:12,290 --> 04:39:13,190
Huh ?

5500
04:39:13,220 --> 04:39:14,730
It is time to close this up,

5501
04:39:14,760 --> 04:39:16,290
if you could please leave ?

5502
04:39:15,930 --> 04:39:17,290
Do you know what time it is ?

5503
04:39:18,160 --> 04:39:20,030
Why not give me some more time ?

5504
04:39:20,730 --> 04:39:22,770
Well, you look pretty tired,

5505
04:39:22,830 --> 04:39:24,330
I'd say you should get out of here quickly

5506
04:39:24,770 --> 04:39:26,870
I'm taking a nap then

5507
04:39:26,670 --> 04:39:27,970
Bad idea

5508
04:39:28,370 --> 04:39:29,470
Excuse me

5509
04:39:30,640 --> 04:39:31,540
Are you....a.....woman ??

5510
04:39:31,540 --> 04:39:33,940
Are you....a.....woman ??

5511
04:39:33,980 --> 04:39:36,180
You're in the men's sauna

5512
04:39:36,750 --> 04:39:38,620
Huh ?

5513
04:39:38,720 --> 04:39:41,390
Your eyes are gone, by the way

5514
04:39:41,690 --> 04:39:43,090
Have you been drinking ?

5515
04:39:43,520 --> 04:39:44,790
That's not good

5516
04:39:45,920 --> 04:39:47,420
Seriously, you're showing your.....

5517
04:39:48,060 --> 04:39:49,160
Excuse us, but your legs.....

5518
04:39:49,590 --> 04:39:51,560
The towel isn't even covering your breasts

5519
04:39:51,560 --> 04:39:52,660
Why don't you fix that a little bit ?

5520
04:39:52,960 --> 04:39:54,570
And your legs, close your legs

5521
04:39:54,670 --> 04:39:56,770
Excuse me, but you're married ?

5522
04:39:56,870 --> 04:39:59,800
I notice you've got a ring

5523
04:40:01,970 --> 04:40:02,910
And you know what ?

5524
04:40:03,440 --> 04:40:07,380
How does Osamu (her husband) feel about this gig ?

5525
04:40:04,470 --> 04:40:07,480
Her husband/writer

5526
04:40:04,470 --> 04:40:07,480
Osamu Suzuki

5527
04:40:07,880 --> 04:40:10,180
You're being a moron right now

5528
04:40:09,850 --> 04:40:10,310
Get outta here

5529
04:40:10,610 --> 04:40:11,350
You're a moron !

5530
04:40:11,680 --> 04:40:12,280
Get out of there

5531
04:40:12,620 --> 04:40:15,690
Will you guys drag her out of there ?

5532
04:40:14,790 --> 04:40:15,890
I don't think so

5533
04:40:16,220 --> 04:40:17,450
That's impossible

5534
04:40:17,650 --> 04:40:20,560
Tanaka, I'm volunteering you for this

5535
04:40:21,990 --> 04:40:23,290
I can't do this to a woman

5536
04:40:23,690 --> 04:40:25,230
Why don't we all help her ?

5537
04:40:25,360 --> 04:40:29,330
Cocorico is in charge

5538
04:40:25,530 --> 04:40:26,260
Ma'am, please

5539
04:40:26,500 --> 04:40:27,800
What do you want ?

5540
04:40:29,730 --> 04:40:31,270
Don't bother me

5541
04:40:31,940 --> 04:40:33,440
I'm not leaving

5542
04:40:33,870 --> 04:40:37,010
She's showing her boobs right now

5543
04:40:36,370 --> 04:40:37,010
Let's go

5544
04:40:38,410 --> 04:40:40,210
Do we have to call the cops ?

5545
04:40:45,620 --> 04:40:47,180
You need to be more careful

5546
04:40:50,150 --> 04:40:54,020
Requires 4 members after all

5547
04:40:52,060 --> 04:40:53,720
Yama-chan, be careful

5548
04:40:57,290 --> 04:40:58,460
What are you, a grand piano ?
Freakin' moron !

5549
04:40:58,460 --> 04:41:00,460
What are you, a grand piano ?
Freakin' moron !

5550
04:41:03,000 --> 04:41:04,230
Let's be careful

5551
04:41:06,440 --> 04:41:07,300
Here we go

5552
04:41:08,610 --> 04:41:10,010
3, 2, 1,

5553
04:41:14,850 --> 04:41:16,280
Don't lose your towel

5554
04:41:16,710 --> 04:41:19,080
You have more issues than water in your ears

5555
04:41:19,120 --> 04:41:21,620
You need to get your priorities straight

5556
04:41:22,290 --> 04:41:23,450
I've had enough !

5557
04:41:23,520 --> 04:41:24,350
Damn you !

5558
04:41:24,420 --> 04:41:25,560
Moron !

5559
04:41:26,620 --> 04:41:27,860
You're a freakin' moron

5560
04:41:36,830 --> 04:41:37,800
Shall we go ?

5561
04:41:37,830 --> 04:41:38,800
Good job, guys

5562
04:41:38,970 --> 04:41:41,670
Please, go straight home

5563
04:41:44,910 --> 04:41:47,240
It's been 24 hours since the start

5564
04:41:48,780 --> 04:41:52,220
Having worked 24 hours straight without any sleep,

5565
04:41:52,680 --> 04:41:58,420
they have no remaining physical or mental strength

5566
04:42:00,060 --> 04:42:04,630
But this is the moment they've been waiting for

5567
04:42:08,130 --> 04:42:10,130
You all did a good job

5568
04:42:10,370 --> 04:42:13,740
Now you are all graduates of

5569
04:42:13,770 --> 04:42:15,210
Gasu Kurobikari Princess Hotel

5570
04:42:15,240 --> 04:42:17,270
Congratulations

5571
04:42:15,510 --> 04:42:16,340
We did it !

5572
04:42:19,540 --> 04:42:21,410
How was it, Endo ?

5573
04:42:22,610 --> 04:42:24,110
There were many hurdles

5574
04:42:24,480 --> 04:42:26,220
but it was overall a good experience

5575
04:42:25,880 --> 04:42:27,150
How about you, Tanaka ?

5576
04:42:27,520 --> 04:42:30,090
This was the toughest one yet,

5577
04:42:30,390 --> 04:42:33,720
but I feel like we did great as a team

5578
04:42:33,220 --> 04:42:34,220
Yamasaki ?

5579
04:42:34,520 --> 04:42:38,460
It's been a long time since I've stayed up all night

5580
04:42:37,690 --> 04:42:38,460
Hamada ?

5581
04:42:38,500 --> 04:42:39,760
Ah !

5582
04:42:39,930 --> 04:42:42,970
Thank you very much

5583
04:42:44,170 --> 04:42:46,900
Can't you talk normal ?

5584
04:42:46,040 --> 04:42:46,900
You were doing a character

5585
04:42:50,170 --> 04:42:51,740
Thank you

5586
04:42:51,780 --> 04:42:53,710
Thank you very much

5587
04:42:54,140 --> 04:42:55,780
Matsumoto !

5588
04:42:56,280 --> 04:42:58,050
He just said his

5589
04:42:59,180 --> 04:43:01,620
We never got into the rhythm

5590
04:43:01,820 --> 04:43:02,750
Shall we go ?

5591
04:43:06,320 --> 04:43:07,860
Finally

5592
04:43:09,730 --> 04:43:10,790
24 hours

5593
04:43:11,230 --> 04:43:12,860
This one was the most tiring

5594
04:43:19,540 --> 04:43:21,140
I guess it's the new year now

5595
04:43:21,710 --> 04:43:22,970
OK, this is where I'm saying bye

5596
04:43:23,470 --> 04:43:24,710
Bye

5597
04:43:26,280 --> 04:43:26,940
It's cold

5598
04:43:29,550 --> 04:43:33,850
There's nothing to worry about ~ !!

5599
04:43:35,520 --> 04:43:36,750
Happy New Year

5600
04:43:37,120 --> 04:43:42,260
Hotel Owner
Kenji Suga

5601
04:43:37,190 --> 04:43:39,260
I am the future owner of this hotel

5602
04:43:40,620 --> 04:43:42,060
I'm still in 9th grade

5603
04:43:42,390 --> 04:43:44,090
anyways, you all did great

5604
04:43:44,190 --> 04:43:45,500
You're a 9th grader ?

5605
04:43:45,330 --> 04:43:46,400
9th grade ?

5606
04:43:46,730 --> 04:43:47,960
I'll be following my father's footsteps

5607
04:43:48,030 --> 04:43:49,600
You gotta stop eating so much

5608
04:43:50,030 --> 04:43:51,070
Thank you very much

5609
04:43:51,940 --> 04:43:53,370
Again, I'd like to thank all of you

5610
04:43:53,840 --> 04:43:55,010
And especially Yamasaki-san,

5611
04:43:55,710 --> 04:43:58,280
I know your days as a comic are numbered this year

5612
04:43:58,610 --> 04:43:59,710
But the rest of you,

5613
04:44:00,010 --> 04:44:03,950
There's nothing to worry about ~ !

5614
04:44:08,350 --> 04:44:10,690
Suga-san did great job finishing this series

5615
04:44:17,830 --> 04:44:20,300
It gets my back more than anything

5616
04:44:25,370 --> 04:44:31,580
Butt-Slap Counter

5617
04:44:25,370 --> 04:44:31,580
Hitoshi Matsumoto

5618
04:44:25,370 --> 04:44:31,580
Hosei Yamasaki

5619
04:44:25,370 --> 04:44:31,580
Masatoshi Hamada

5620
04:44:25,370 --> 04:44:31,580
Naoki Tanaka

5621
04:44:25,370 --> 04:44:31,580
Shozo Endo

5622
04:44:30,140 --> 04:44:31,170
Incredible

5623
04:44:31,880 --> 04:44:37,050
On your way to the bus,

5624
04:44:32,080 --> 04:48:17,270
Single bed

5625
04:44:37,150 --> 04:44:42,650
was when you realized what was about to happen

5626
04:44:42,920 --> 04:44:48,830
It had been a year since the last slap

5627
04:44:44,220 --> 04:48:17,270
Sharan Q

5628
04:44:48,960 --> 04:44:54,630
And you had forgotten about the pain in your ass

5629
04:44:54,760 --> 04:45:00,540
Right off the bat, you got a beating from Chono

5630
04:45:00,570 --> 04:45:05,080
which made all of your hearts sink

5631
04:45:05,910 --> 04:45:08,850
And you laughed at Daichi

5632
04:45:08,980 --> 04:45:11,620
then laughed some more at Matsuko

5633
04:45:11,650 --> 04:45:17,820
Both of which led to more butt-slappings

5634
04:45:18,420 --> 04:45:25,100
As if using Chiaki

5635
04:45:25,160 --> 04:45:30,400
to get laughs wasn't enough anymore

5636
04:45:30,570 --> 04:45:36,170
You brought in Natsumi

5637
04:45:36,710 --> 04:45:42,280
which made Hamada uneasy

5638
04:45:42,610 --> 04:45:50,050
Heipo, in a single bed room,

5639
04:45:50,050 --> 04:45:55,860
can only scream by himself

5640
04:45:56,060 --> 04:46:01,700
No matter how stupid the gags were,

5641
04:46:01,930 --> 04:46:07,140
all of you still managed to laugh

5642
04:46:07,570 --> 04:46:13,040
The song sung by Masako

5643
04:46:13,310 --> 04:46:18,680
has not changed since your youth

5644
04:46:19,080 --> 04:46:25,060
Why did she agree to do this show,

5645
04:46:25,420 --> 04:46:31,490
when she could make tons of money on other shows ?

5646
04:46:40,070 --> 04:46:45,410
Ueshima, the chairman of "Hand-Towel" group

5647
04:46:45,710 --> 04:46:48,550
Who's that receptionist ?

5648
04:46:48,910 --> 04:46:51,010
It's her, Bibari

5649
04:46:51,280 --> 04:46:53,620
Nice stare-down,

5650
04:46:53,980 --> 04:46:56,790
Taxi driver: Devi

5651
04:46:56,820 --> 04:47:02,190
The Kano Sisters swing their breasts

5652
04:47:03,290 --> 04:47:08,630
Unlike his brother Shozo,

5653
04:47:09,170 --> 04:47:14,870
little brother got laughs wearing tighty whities

5654
04:47:15,170 --> 04:47:20,810
Despite an orthodox gag by Takeuchi

5655
04:47:20,840 --> 04:47:26,980
Hitoshi still loved it

5656
04:47:27,420 --> 04:47:34,720
Anna's mother didn't disappoint

5657
04:47:34,760 --> 04:47:40,460
with her shaky acting chops

5658
04:47:40,560 --> 04:47:46,500
What was meant to be simple filler

5659
04:47:46,600 --> 04:47:52,240
resulted in an unexpected expression of victory

5660
04:47:52,910 --> 04:47:57,910
If you could go back,

5661
04:47:58,820 --> 04:48:05,420
you wouldn't have laughed this much

5662
04:48:06,920 --> 04:48:12,130
Your life as a single man has ended

5663
04:48:12,730 --> 04:48:18,030
with a newborn daughter in your life

5664
04:48:18,640 --> 04:48:24,240
We kept the stupidity rolling

5665
04:48:24,410 --> 04:48:29,550
and laughed as a team

5666
04:48:30,110 --> 04:48:36,190
The last gag

5667
04:48:35,820 --> 04:48:37,820
I had no idea Tanaka fell right then

5668
04:48:36,220 --> 04:48:41,560
ended with Oshima's nudity

5669
04:48:41,730 --> 04:48:47,560
If there's no complaint calls

5670
04:48:48,100 --> 04:48:56,540
Yoshinobu won't be happy

5671
04:48:57,410 --> 04:49:05,420
Happy New Year

5672
04:48:59,010 --> 04:49:05,420
We wish you a year full of laughter

5673
04:49:04,350 --> 04:49:05,220
That's it

5674
04:49:06,420 --> 04:49:07,780
As is the case every year,

5675
04:49:07,920 --> 04:49:10,150
Matsumoto-san got the most slaps

5676
04:49:10,690 --> 04:49:12,120
That was a tough day

5677
04:49:12,620 --> 04:49:14,360
We didn't get to sleep at all

5678
04:49:14,760 --> 04:49:16,030
It was serious business

5679
04:49:17,190 --> 04:49:17,960
You know what though ?

5680
04:49:18,230 --> 04:49:19,600
You get so jumpy at night

5681
04:49:20,060 --> 04:49:20,730
Hear me out

5682
04:49:21,030 --> 04:49:23,570
That guy was supposed to grab each of our legs

5683
04:49:24,430 --> 04:49:27,370
but he got both of my legs instead

5684
04:49:27,770 --> 04:49:28,610
Of course, I was scared !!

5685
04:49:29,040 --> 04:49:29,970
I couldn't escape !

5686
04:49:31,070 --> 04:49:33,480
I was scared of not having control over my feet

5687
04:49:34,780 --> 04:49:36,110
I was trapped

5688
04:49:37,110 --> 04:49:40,020
I have to apologize that we ended with the sauna scene

5689
04:49:40,320 --> 04:49:42,990
The ending song even mentioned something about receiving complaint calls

5690
04:49:43,290 --> 04:49:45,090
Oshima did that to herself,

5691
04:49:45,520 --> 04:49:47,220
and I'm not responsible at all

5692
04:49:47,360 --> 04:49:48,220
That wasn't part of the deal

5693
04:49:49,190 --> 04:49:51,190
She went ahead and took her clothes off, right ?

5694
04:49:52,930 --> 04:49:57,000
Next year, we should have ARASHI take over for us

5695
04:49:56,300 --> 04:49:59,440
*ARASHI is a popular boy band

5696
04:50:06,410 --> 04:50:09,110
I see the new year has already arrived

5697
04:50:09,350 --> 04:50:10,580
Happy New Year

5698
04:50:11,410 --> 04:50:13,720
Thank you for continuing to support Gaki No Tuskai

5699
04:50:13,820 --> 04:50:15,120
Thank you
