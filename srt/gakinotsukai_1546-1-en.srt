1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,690
The First Annual Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende, Chiki Chiki

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,550
The third "Get into character with 100 yen items"

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,760
Let's meet at Star Wars~!!

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,830
Endo said you're noisy

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,090
Please wait a moment...

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,780
I kept my voice down already, because I know you guys will complain

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,800
Matsumoto-san kept saying "So loud, right? He's so loud"

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,170
And all I did is a little nod

9
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,140
That's just the same as saying it   -Exactly, he said it

10
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,740
What's wrong with you?

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,160
All I did is a little nod, and still, I got my ass kicked

12
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,000
So we did drag queens and Showa stars before   -Yes, we did

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,580
And this time, it's Star Wars   -Yes, Star wars

14
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,560
Get into character with 100 yen items

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:54,540
Chewbacca

16
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:54,540
Darth Vader

17
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:54,540
Jabba the Hut

18
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:54,540
Stormtrooper

19
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:54,540
Yoda

20
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:48,960
This time, the following characters are selected from Star Wars, the movie loved around the world

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,540
Please enjoy the show with your smartphone in one hand, and compare them with the actual characters

22
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,240
First of all, let's draw and decide each member's character

23
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,240
Ready, set

24
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:07,630
Oh, it's him!   -This is it!

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,080
Hamada's character is Jabba the Hutt

26
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,160
It's Jabba the Hutt   -How the heck am I going to do this?

27
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,860
You're super advantaged!   -Exactly

28
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,230
You can do it with just 200 yen

29
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,280
Excuse me, excuse me

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,940
Stop messing with me, dude!

31
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,430
Barely enough indeed   -No way

32
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:26,030
Right in front of the entrance already!!

33
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,310
The members have a budget of 10,000 yen in total

34
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,600
This time, let's decide the budget that each of them can use

35
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,240
Please, this is crucial

36
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,870
Of course, more is better

37
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,260
Hope you can get 2,000 yen

38
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,810
Wow, 1,000 yen

39
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,390
Housei Chewbacca 1,000 yen

40
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,200
Only 1,000 yen?

41
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,220
Chewbacca with 1,000 yen is gonna be awful

42
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,340
That's gonna be awful

43
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,200
How are you going to make it look hairy with just 1,000 yen?

44
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,340
Yeah, exactly

45
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,090
He's not even hairy in real life

46
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,700
Chewbacca

47
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,700
Darth Vader

48
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,700
Jabba the Hutt

49
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,700
Stormtrooper

50
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,700
The budget for each member is as above

51
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,700
Yoda

52
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,770
No way, Hamada-san don't need 2,000 yen

53
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,770
Why the heck?

54
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,550
Not enough, not enough

55
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,780
You're gonna have 1,800 yen left

56
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,720
Just go home and grab a coarse sweater

57
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,680
A loosely woven one

58
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,790
First of all, they will go shopping at a 100 yen shop

59
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,130
Then, they'll make their character costume

60
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:40,180
And finally, they will perform a skit on stage together, and show us their character

61
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,020
It's Chewbacca

62
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,110
I want to make something that looks exactly like Chewbacca

63
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,470
Please wear this mask

64
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,500
Oh, are you guys selling this now?

65
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,810
No, we're not selling it

66
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,230
Not selling it?   -It's not for sale

67
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,460
Eh? It's not for sale?

68
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,920
Many people say they really want this

69
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,020
The Gaki no Tsukai mask

70
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,990
Okay

71
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:11,240
Chewbacca

72
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,430
I'll walk around and see what's useful

73
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,070
First thing first, I need some yarns

74
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:11,240
The face and the impression as a whole are very important

75
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,190
I found it, I found the yarns

76
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,900
The color of Chewbacca, this one right?

77
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,370
Burnt brown color

78
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,200
This color looks good too

79
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,720
I'll use both of these colors

80
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:30,330
And make them think "Wow, there's two kinds of color, he has amazing attention to detail"

81
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,830
Can these be those fangs?

82
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,940
Those fangs...

83
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,970
LEGO bricks

84
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,010
Is this going to work?

85
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,900
I'm afraid that I'll swallow it by accident

86
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:51,410
In order to keep within the 1,000 yen budget, Housei continues to select the items carefully

87
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,620
Chewbacca carries a bag, right?

88
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,400
Oh, I found it, this one!

89
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,690
This one, this one!

90
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:00,990
This is it, this is it

91
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:01,820
How mcuh?

92
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,250
Oh, 200 yen!!

93
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:09,330
It's out of my reach

94
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:14,040
To be honest, 2,000 yen is quite a lot

95
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:19,600
Darth Vader

96
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,850
It's all about the face, right?

97
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,380
His mouth looks like this, isn't it?

98
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,060
The tip of this thing

99
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,180
These look good too

100
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,200
This one is better

101
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,850
Look at this

102
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,950
Oh my god, everything looks good

103
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,980
Look at this shape, it's made to cover your mouth

104
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,750
Perfect fitting

105
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:55,750
He continues to search for items in black color

106
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,390
I'm losing my mind

107
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:04,080
I saw those inks and thought "oh, that's good"

108
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,620
I can't stop thinking about making myself black

109
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,860
I think I'm quite lucky compared to the other members

110
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,590
Which member do you worry about most?

111
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,360
I'm most worried about my duo partner

112
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,010
It's nearly impossible to look like R2-D2

113
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,970
It's not in human form

114
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,640
I only have 1,000 yen, right?

115
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,210
Yes, only 1,000 yen

116
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:38,210
Said to be the most protective mask against Corona, the Gaki mask

117
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,850
Let's go

118
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,810
I want to be fussy about the form

119
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,590
It has the most unique form within all characters

120
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:51,300
So I have to make sure I hide my body well

121
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,770
Searching for items that can hide one's body

122
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:56,810
This looks good

123
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,810
Shower curtain

124
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,970
Hide my body

125
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:04,380
(To hide one's body) Cylinder, are they selling it?

126
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,190
Oh, I think I found it

127
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,890
Too small, too small, no way

128
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,350
Definitely impossible

129
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:18,200
Aren't there any cylinders?

130
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,490
Do you think the other members can do well?

131
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,790
Who do you mean?   -Like Hamada-san

132
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:26,020
Hamada-san is 0 yen, right!!

133
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,930
He doesn't need to buy anything

134
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,090
Hamada-san, please wear this mask first

135
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,230
Okay, let's go

136
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,660
You don't need it?

137
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,280
What do you mean?

138
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,810
He has a big body, so...

139
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:44,500
Jabba the Hut

140
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,480
Oh, there are some towels here

141
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,160
These are probably too small

142
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:57,500
Maybe these felts could work?

143
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:03,300
But then I'll need to buy a whole lot of it

144
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:07,540
This looks good!!

145
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,180
Glad that I found this, better buy two of these

146
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,850
Just in case it's not enough

147
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:17,680
Eh, I didn't know there's such a thing

148
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,680
How are you going to make a big body?

149
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,850
That's a good question

150
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:26,970
I need something like a base to make my body look big

151
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:30,200
Using just newspaper is too inefficient

152
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,320
Hula hoop, and it can be assembled

153
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,440
So just assemble it and it'll become a hula hoop

154
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:44,500
I see, I see

155
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:48,790
The shop assistant was staring at me just now

156
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,960
This thing could be the base, right?

157
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,670
Just put this inside and cover it with fabric, that should work, right?

158
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,560
Right? This is perfect

159
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:03,730
What else can this guy do?

160
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:12,140
Yoda

161
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,930
I need to become Yoda with 1,500 yen

162
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:17,280
Megaphone

163
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,530
These can be Yoda's ears

164
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,950
Too big

165
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,420
Pardon me?

166
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,570
It's too big

167
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:31,850
Yes, it's too big, and when I put it here, I hear absolutely nothing

168
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,680
I'll need to say "pardon me" all the time

169
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:40,760
He bought a torch for the lightsaber

170
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,640
1,500 yen is not enough

171
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:50,480
Sorry, but I can't see this

172
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,210
What should I do?

173
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:57,450
I really can't see it

174
00:08:54,790 --> 00:09:00,180
His reading glasses are not with him today

175
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,880
What do you think about the other members?

176
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,330
Tanaka is good at handicraft

177
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,950
He's C-3PO, right?

178
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,740
Their body shapes match too

179
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,570
So I think Tanaka should do well

180
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:19,920
The main point of C-3PO is that robot look and metallic appearance

181
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,040
So I'll put effort into those aspects of the character

182
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:31,710
Well, this is it, right? This kind of color

183
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,990
This kind of color is ideal

184
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:38,310
Of course it should have a gold body

185
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:43,330
But I want to put focus on making it's eyes look good too

186
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:55,140
Oh, look, this is already C-3PO

187
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,740
C-3PO's eyes look exactly like this

188
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,800
I want that...

189
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,920
Something like a belly band

190
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,780
This should do the job

191
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,780
This is good

192
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,340
But well, this is a bit...

193
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,130
The texture is too rough...

194
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,430
I have sensitive skin, so...

195
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,830
Excuse me

196
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,860
Maybe I can use this too, huh?

197
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:33,400
Stormtrooper

198
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,770
It's mainly in white color, white and black

199
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,900
So...

200
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,520
It's actually quite easy

201
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,150
I never paid attention to this character though

202
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,860
He's a super minor character, huh?

203
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,330
I'm the protagonist of this show though

204
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,330
What about this?

205
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:53,810
The color is not right though

206
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,670
Not quite right

207
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:02,410
The color need to be whiter

208
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:13,280
Spending all of the time searching for white items

209
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,790
I see

210
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,860
??? should work

211
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,310
This should do the job

212
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,440
100 yen each?   -Yes

213
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,780
Having 4 of these should be enough, leaving some leeway

214
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:42,880
So I don't even need to spend 1,500 yen...

215
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,460
I found so many other things that I want

216
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,470
In private

217
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,240
After purchasing the materials, the members will now make their character costume

218
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,070
They're now in their own room, and begin working

219
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:13,160
Stormtrooper

220
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:19,480
This one is easier to recognize, right?

221
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,390
This one is better

222
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:27,480
Yoda

223
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,580
Looking good with reading glasses

224
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:38,100
The non-slip sheet

225
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,180
I should have bought one more

226
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,970
Are you barely within budget, Endo-san?

227
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:45,870
Barely within 1,500 yen

228
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:49,350
Then sorry, you have to stick to these items

229
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,280
Is it possible to borrow it from someone?

230
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,720
Can I borrow just 200 yen? Nope?

231
00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:05,370
Jabba the Hut

232
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:05,560
Why do I need to do this kind of thing?

233
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:10,670
Grumbling about the theme

234
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,720
I don't even freaking know about him!

235
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,350
Ouch!

236
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,140
Ouch!

237
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:24,150
Immediate divine retribution

238
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:34,190
We don't need anymore evidence for the judge (of Hamada aging)

239
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:39,700
Darth Vader

240
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:39,700
Assembling the purchased materials in various ways

241
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,170
And transforming it into the desired shape

242
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,740
Freaking good, right?

243
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,640
You're terrified, right? Seriously

244
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,940
I'm terrified of myself too

245
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:55,890
Chewbacca

246
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:55,240
Chewbacca Housei is now making the base

247
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,180
Looking good, very good

248
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,700
It all starts here

249
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,940
Can you imagine the final form?

250
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,740
Yes, I can

251
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:19,580
The characters are inside my mind

252
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:24,500
I've been imagining it for many times

253
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,780
I have no hesitation in regard to this

254
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,850
Tanaka with absolute confidence

255
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:35,520
15 minutes later

256
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,460
Tanaka

257
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,910
Tanaka, hey

258
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:42,330
Yes!

259
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,030
You're done?

260
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,860
No, not yet

261
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,500
You're done already?

262
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,370
No I'm not done yet, dude!

263
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,480
I didn't say I'm done

264
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,480
You've finished it?

265
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,330
All that's left is to wear it

266
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,770
To wear it?   -So fast

267
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,650
Just to wear it?

268
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,460
As long as the atmosphere is similar...

269
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,830
We need to do a skit together, right?

270
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:18,930
Yes

271
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,490
Should you tell us about it now?

272
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:29,110
Basically each member will go on stage one by one, and have a little battle

273
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:32,600
Will the audience be touched by the story?

274
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,420
That depends on your acting ability

275
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,620
After this, the members will gather as their character

276
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,760
Check out their final costumes!

277
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,560
The members have been making their character with 100 yen items

278
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,870
And now, it's finally the time for them to gather at the studio!

279
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:58,800
Check out their final costumes!

280
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:13,240
The Imperial Army, led by Darth Vader, which aims to conquer the entire universe

281
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,240
And the Jedi Knights, who are the guardians of peace and justice

282
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,820
There has been a fierce battle ongoing between the two parties

283
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,140
Princess Leia!

284
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,740
Princess Leia!

285
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,640
Luke Skywalker

286
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,830
Where did she go?

287
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,780
Damn it!

288
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,120
Stormtrooper

289
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:50,260

Stormtrooper

298
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,510
Using a bath chair as his head

299
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,710
And wrapping the whole body with kitchen paper

300
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,260
The costume has been done reasonably

301
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,710
Where is Princess Leia?

302
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:26,930
Stormtrooper, you are no match for him, step back

303
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:37,340
Calculator + Labels

304
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:37,340
Insulation sheet

305
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:37,340
Rubbish bags

306
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:37,340
Rubbish bin

307
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:37,340

310
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:37,340
Torch

311
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,500
The Darth Vader reproduced with 2,000 yen

312
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,910
The calculator on his chest has been colorized with stick notes

313
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,340
We can clearly see that he is paying attention to details

314
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,640
Seems like you've gone through a lot of training, Skywalker?

315
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,180
However, you're no different to a baby in front of me!

316
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,420
Luke-sama!

317
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,420
C-3PO

318
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,050
What have you done to Luke-sama!

319
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:11,940

Wrapping paper

325
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,960
The insufficiency of wrapping paper, has been compensated by the storage bag

326
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,940
This is the limit of 1,000 yen budget

327
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,180
Ah, but there's nothing I can do

328
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,190
What should I do? Oh gee!

329
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,120
Someone!

330
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,150
Someone, please!

331
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,340
Oh! R2!

The unique form is reproduced with bathtub and aluminum sheet

338
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:37,730
However, it looks terrible from the back

339
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,640
Please help us, R2!

340
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,760
I see! That's a great idea!

341
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,780
Chewbacca! Chewbacca!

342
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:10,500

Whipping machine (part)

348
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:10,500
Yarn x 2 types

349
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:06,860
It wasn't possible to buy enough yarn with 1,000 yen, and he doesn't look hairy at all

350
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:10,500
Only the regions around his face has been done appropriately

351
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,720
Even Chewbacca?!

352
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,750
Ah! What should I do?

353
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,220
Someone, please! Please help us!

354
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,220
Wait a second!

355
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,770
That's it

356
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,600
Just leave it to me!

357
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,490
I knew you would come, Yoda

358
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:54,610
Butterfly net

366
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,570
The main part is the coat, which is made by connecting multiple rain coats

367
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,230
Furthermore

368
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:54,610
The facial expressions were carefully drew with a pen

369
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,910
Luke, look carefully

370
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:13,690
Damn it! This guy is really tough

371
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:16,060
I've been waiting for this moment

372
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:26,840
I'm a man who will do anything for money

373
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,790
I've been waiting for this moment

374
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:40,660
I'm a man who will do anything for money

375
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:45,610
You Jedi knights are hurting my business

376
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:55,660
Curtain x 2

377
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:55,660
Hula hoop

378
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:55,660
Sandal

379
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:55,660
Socks

380
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:49,180
The body is covered with two curtains

381
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,510
Hula hoop is used to make the body look big

382
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,670
He did nothing to his face, and went on the stage shamelessly

383
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,810
Here you come! Jabba the Hutt!

384
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:03,610
Good! Stormtrooper, go beat Yoda with Jabba the Hutt!

385
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,480
Come on!

386
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,720
I'll defeat you guys and restore peace

387
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,770
Not yet! Not yet!

388
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,720
Luke, look at me!

389
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,390
Luke, remember to look at me

390
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,580
It hurts...

391
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,260
Hooray!

392
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,290
Hooray! Hooray!

393
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:52,360
We did it! Hooray!

394
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,210
We did it

395
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:57,620
Hooray! Hooray! We defeated them!

396
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,570
Peace has been restored!

397
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:09,630
Well...

398
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,880
With this...

399
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,640
We're gonna get the Galaxy Award (for TV shows)

400
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,990
Really? We can?

401
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,020
Finally, we got it

402
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,830
Gaki never won the award yet, right?   -Yeah, finally

403
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,870
This dude is awful, right?   -Yes, agreed

404
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:24,450
Why?

405
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,600
You did absolutely nothing

406
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,830
No, I did

407
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,320
That didn't cost you anything

408
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,660
Yes, it did

409
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,660
I spent over a thousand yen

410
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,930
Eh?   -Eh?

411
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:36,000
Tanaka, why did it take you so long with just that?

412
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,690
Well, I've only got 1,000 yen

413
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,220
And if that's all you did

414
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,510
I hope you gave me your 500 yen   -You're right

415
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,160
1,000 yen must be enough

416
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,040
What the heck is this?

417
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,940
He's wearing paper diapers?!

418
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,750
Wow, yeah, he is   -That doesn't matter

419
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,020
Honestly, I think my costume has the highest quality

420
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:00,120
And furthermore, I didn't even spend all of my 1,500 yen

421
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,390
Oh, you still have some money left?

422
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,340
This is for you guys

423
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:11,460
And furthermore, I didn't even spend all of my 1,500 yen

424
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,400
Oh, you still have some money left?

425
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,370
Yes, yes

426
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,740
This is for you guys

427
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,300
I had 300 yen left   -Why this?

428
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,580
Why the heck?

429
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,320
Matsumoto had 300 yen left after shopping, and he decided to...

430
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,000
Shall I buy a bouquet of flowers?

431
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:37,180
For some reason, he decided to buy some roses

432
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,890
No, no, that's not right

433
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:42,410
You bought us some presents?

434
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:43,340
You're so kind

435
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,680
Can I take this? Thank you

436
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,010
He even bought us presents!

437
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:46,790
He finished it with ease

438
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,190
Sorry for hitting you just now

439
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,420
No, no, I didn't expect that, but no worries

440
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,750
I didn't expect to be beaten in this costume at the center of the stage

441
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:57,230
When you got beaten up, the cameras were shaking

442
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,780
I bet they thought Yoda is so damn weak
