1st Gaki-no-tsukai-ya-arahende!
Duo competition! The Game of Comedian's Life!

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,410
Meet the participants!
Cocorico!

3
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:15,480
I won't lose!

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,650
Jicho-Kacho!

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,490
I'll do it!

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,590
Football Hour!

7
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:22,790
I'll do my best!

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,630
And today we have special guests!

9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,530
So please come on in!

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,460
Downtown!

11
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,310
- We made the Game of Life.
- I see.

12
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,680
It's very well done.

13
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:50,480
You spin the roulette and various events happen where you stop.

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,520
- Is this place like Osaka?
- That's right.

15
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,860
The theme is about a comedian just making his debut.

16
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,660
Each duo will get $20,000 each.

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:07,470
The team with the most money will win 100,000 yen.

18
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,740
Do we get the same as them, only $20,000?

19
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,280
- Yes, you all get the same.
- Is that right?

20
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,050
- Is that okay?
- Well, that's all right.

21

[Subbed by RAIDEN1017]

22
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,530
Let's start with Cocorico!

23
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,200
May I spin this?

24
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,270
Well, that's okay.

25
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,050
- How about this?
- Please read the text out loud.

26
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:57,850
You plan a singles party for Nicho Kenju.
You got an allowance of $3,000 from them.

27
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,820
We don't do that kind of thing for our juniors.

28
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,660
- Here you go.
- Thanks!

29
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,460
You stopped at a nice square.

30
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,530
Jicho Kacho!

31
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,340
Come on big number!

32
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,340
4!

33
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:26,180
You perform at a local show in Akita Prefecture, but you are not paid for transportation.
You pay $3,000.

34
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,920
Then you must pay it.

35
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,850
- That's not an option.
- It happens.

36
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,290
Football Hour!

37
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,920
Come on!

38
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,830
Because I'm nervous.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,500
Same as them.

40
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,630
I'll give you $3,000.

41
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,400
Thank you.

42
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,340
Next up is Downtown.

43
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,570
Go ahead.

44
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,580
He is good at spinning this.

45
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:09,490
You forgot all your lines in your first stage performance.
You got mad at Master Kyojin and stayed up all night drinking.
You have to pay $4,000.

46
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,790
Don't worry!

47
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,630
Yeah, I don't mind.
But...

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,370
Master Kyojin won't get mad at us for this.

49
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,870
We have never been mad at him for such a thing.

50
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,210
But It's just...

51
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,740
He has never been mad at us for forgetting a line in our manzai, but he has been mad at us for not saying hello to him.

52
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,080
And we couldn't drink these days.

53
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,050
This is not about you guys.
This is just the game of life.

54
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:52,670
We are willing to pay for this, but if we do so, we are affirming that Master Kyojin is the kind of person who does this kind of thing.

55
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,400
Are you guys taking Master Kyojin into consideration?

56
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,640
This is just a game and I don't think you need to worry about that.

57
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,340
He might say, "I won't be offended by that!"

58
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,050
This is just a board game.

59
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:13,350
In the meantime, would you mind paying me $4,000?
It's your first turn.

60
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,560
Then I will take $5,000 and give you back $1,000.

61
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,530
No, I'll pay you $4,000.

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,060
The game has just begun.

63
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,230
Reversing the situation later is also a real pleasure.

64
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,770
Excuse me.
I only got $2,000.

65
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,310
- I thought it was $2,000 for the two of us.
- It's $4,000.

66
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,110
$4,000 for the two of us?
This is confusing.

67
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,550
Do what you want.

68
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,490
- Write it down plainly.
- Sorry.

69
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,120
- Can I spin the wheel?
- Okay, Cocorico!

70
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,220
Second turn!

71
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,030
"STOP!"

72
00:04:54,090 --> 00:05:08,240
STOP!: Moving to Tokyo
You get a congratulatory gift for moving to Tokyo from same generation comedians at the roulette numbers.
1-4: You get $5,000 each from all of them.
5-8: You get nothing because they are all jealous.

73
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:19,050
Then, pay them $5,000!

74
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,060
- Congratulations!
- You guys should come to Tokyo soon!

75
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,800
- You're early!
-I'm not the same generation as you guys!

76
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,230
In this game, we are the same generation.

77
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,570
What do that mean?

78
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,500
We don't have to pay, right?

79
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,810
We are not of the same generation as you.

80
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,240
In this game, we are comedians of the same generation.

81
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,380
That's unfair.
That's kind of confusing.

82
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,250
Is that so?

83
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,590
- But two of them have already paid, so we don't have to pay anymore, right?
- You guys already got $10,000.

84
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,400
- You shouldn't talk about money so much.
- That's not what I meant.

85
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:11,770
But this is a game where the team with the most money wins in the end.

86
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,010
You should pay rightly.

87
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:20,510
Yes, let's do it right. If you do it right, we won't say anything.
And I think there is a contradiction here.

88
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,480
Is that so?

89
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,590
Okay! Let's move on!

90
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:30,020
Okay, let's take one more turn.

91
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,730
It's confusing, let's take one more turn.

92
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:36,330
- Will you pay us next your turn?
- Well, you guys keep that in mind.

93
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:40,000
Guys, keep that in mind.

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,930
Next up is Jicho Kacho?

95
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,640
"STOP!"
Same as before.

96
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,480
- Come on, give me a 1 to 4!
- Roll a 5 to 8!

97
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,250
Yeah!

98
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,850
Thanks, I'll take it.

99
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,120
- Let's work together in Tokyo!
- Next up is Foot!

100
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,690
Wait a sec.

101
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,260
Pay them $5,000.

102
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,630
Will you also pay us now?

103
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,630
Will you pay us $10,000 altogether now?

104
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,230
To put that on hold for now.

105
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,740
Let's go, Foot.

106
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,910
Okay, keep that in mind, too.

107
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:32,750
Downtown hasn't stopped here yet, so maybe this will offset that.
So you guys keep that in mind as well.

108
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:36,520
6! "STOP!"
So please roll a 1 to 4.

109
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,330
It's not that easy.
It's not going to be.

110
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:48,700
- Congratulations.
- Thanks!

111
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,870
Hey, hey, hey, wait!

112
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,940
- Please pay Foot.
- To put that on hold for now.  It's our turn.

113
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,250
Anyway, now it's our turn.

114
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,150
- "STOP!"
- If we land exactly on this square, do we get anything?

115
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,850
No, it's all the same.

116
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,820
- 5 to 8!
- 5 to 8!

117
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,030
- Yes!
- Yay!

118
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,000
Everyone else got a congratulatory gift except you guys.

119
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,370
You guys are making everyone jealous.

120
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:25,540
Why don't you give each of us $5,000?

121
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,810
- I'll pay for it, right!?
- Yes ...

122
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,910
I'll pay it.

123
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:36,480
There is such a thing as a promissory note.
It allows me to lend you money.

124
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,020
I'll borrow it when the time comes, but right now it's fine.
But right now it's fine.

125
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,720
It does not need me now.

126
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,290
I'm not in the mood.

127
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,930
Mood?

128
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,400
Let's keep this in mind.

129
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,900
They will eventually pay everyone $5,000 each.

130
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,540
3!

131
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,310
That's not good at all.

132
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:14,250
You blew up writing a crappy comedic theory on your blog.
You lose a turn.

133
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,360
Take a break.

134
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,430
It's 6!

135
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:28,670
You win the ABC Rookie Comedian Grand Prix for Best Rookie.
You get $10,000 cash prize.

136
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,810
Congratulations!

137
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:39,950
Hey, we won Best Rookie, too.

138
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,480
I know.

139
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:44,450
Then give us our money, too.

140
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,490
You really got the prize money, didn't you?

141
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,420
- Yeah.
- It's a game.

142
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:53,330
Why do players get money when the real winners don't get any?

143
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:57,230
We have never won it.
But this is a game.

144
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,230
I have no idea if this is real or a game.

145
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,770
It's a game.

146
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,570
It's just a game.

147
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,510
Is it a game?

148
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,410
Well, congratulations!

149
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,480
Great!

150
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,720
You got sunstroke and collapsed at an outdoor recording of Narutomo.
You pay $10,000 for hospitalization.

151
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,630
You idiot!
You idiot!

152
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:28,360
Pay up now!

153
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,530
$10,000 is a lot of money!

154
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,030
You were given $10,000.

155
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,500
That's enough!
Pay up now!

156
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,310
Is that going to happen at the outdoor reco...

157
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,740
Don't keep talking about it, just pay up!

158
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,880
It's okay.

159
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,680
Next, Downtown.

160
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,020
Come on!

161
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,480
6!

162
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:59,230
You failed to make it to Tokyo, so you're going back to Osaka.
Back 6 squares.

163
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,860
Back 6 squares.

164
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,800
You guys are not doing well at all.

165
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:14,140
So, Tanaka, you think we failed to make it to Tokyo?

166
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,610
- The actual Downtown?
- Yes.

167
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:20,550
I think you guys were very successful.

168
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:23,580
Then we don't have to go back.

169
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:24,750
This is a game.

170
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,750
Huh?

171
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,260
This is what happens in the game.

172
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,660
What are you guys talking about?

173
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,830
I think this is wrong.

174
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,230
Why are we going back 9 squares?
Why the hell do we have to go back 9  squares?

175
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,030
It's 6 squares.

176
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,670
You're reading that upside down.

177
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,040
Then please go back 6 squares.

178
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,410
So, is it our turn next?

179
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,910
You guys are losing this turn.

180
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,950
Oh, I forgot.

181
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,850
Hey, you just broke the rules!

182
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,690
Pay up!

183
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:05,620
That's not right, you're losing this turn and you're trying to spin the roulette wheel.

184
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:08,260
This is outrageous!

185
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,230
It's like being on TV despite your misconduct.

186
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,270
You guys definitely have to pay the fine!

187
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,570
This is absolutely unacceptable!

188
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,500
- If you do it in the Bon (gambling house) , you have to cut off your finger.
- This is terrible!

189
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,610
Bon...

190
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,750
You've understudied Edo Harumi on a prime time show.

191
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,720
In an atmosphere of disquiet, they spin the roulette wheel.

192
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,490
Then Football Hour stepped into the forbidden area.

193
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,030
Here we go.

194
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,160
7!

195
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,700
Oh, this is dangerous!

196
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:55,110
You're in the middle of a recording for a cooking show, and a mischievous Hattori-sensei pushes wasabi up your nose.

197
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,840
The punishment game!

198
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,780
Please come to this stage.

199
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,380
Here we go!

200
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,290
- Ouch!
- Ow, ow, ow, ow...

201
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,010
Is it serious!?
Give me a break!

202
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,920
Ouch!!!

203
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:51,030
- After days of all-night recording sessions, you eat copious amounts of frisks to keep from getting drowsy.
- Punishment game!

204
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,210
Downtown is next.

205
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,150
1!

206
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:12,280
You guys eat a lot of Frisk!

207
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,490
Punishment game!

208
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,790
Please come to this stage.

209
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,860
Okay, Jicho Kacho do it to them.

210
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,500
Please come here!

211
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,370
I must see this!

212
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,270
Downtown?

213
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,470
Downtown, this is your punishment game.

214
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,070
That's enough.

215
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,480
What's with the vibe?
We can't do it at this timing.

216
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,150
- If we're going to do this, we should do it quickly.
We can't do it anymore at this timing.
- Right.

217
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:48,390
You guys are not good at leading us.
I could have done it if you had led us quickly.

218
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,190
But I've already reset my mood.

219
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,130
Now is not the time for Frisk.

220
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,160
I think we got here pretty smoothly.

221
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:02,070
What are you guys going to do with this vibe?
You think it's funny that we're drinking Frisk now?

222
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:06,270
What's the fun in us doing it now?

223
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:10,140
Now is not the right time for Frisk at all.

224
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,740
"The time for Frisk"...?

225
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,650
I've never heard of the time for Frisk.

226
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,120
Let's keep playing the game.

227
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,250
Let's just pretend we already did it and keep going.

228
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,220
Let's keep the game going.

229
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:26,130
If Downtown gets punished in the next game, let's take them there right away.

230
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:34,170
You guys are being too exuberant.
You don't have to get excited just because it's Downtown.

231
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:38,270
Just do it right away.
Then we can do it with good reactions.

232
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,940
We should have done it right away.

233
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,240
The timing wasn't good.
That wasn't the right time for Frisk.

234
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,580
"The time for Frisk"...?

235
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,450
- It's Downtown's turn.
Keep up the good work, you guys are a little behind.
- It's okay.

236
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,080
2!

237
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,860
You were in a panic because the oden you had in your gourmet report was too hot.

238
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,630
Let's do it!

239
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,330
Don't touch me, you idiot!!

240
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,410
You're hurting me.

241
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,470
Why are you pulling so hard?

242
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,940
Because it's timing to do this.

243
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,750
It hurts when you pull too hard.

244
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,790
- But you said...
- Ouch, ouch, ouch...

245
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,690
Ouch, ouch, ouch...

246
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,590
I'll pull gently, so let's do this.

247
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,630
The timing is not good anymore.

248
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,600
This vibe is not good.

249
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,900
This is not the time for hot oden.

250
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,870
We wanted to do it right away.

251
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,510
That's why we tried to take you.

252
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,810
Ouch, ouch, ouch...

253
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,010
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

254
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:58,680
You need to think more about how you're going to take us.
Hamada is very sensitive.

255
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,520
I'm not pulling him so hard.

256
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,020
But you guys need to take better care of him

257
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:14,570
You have to take his mentality into consideration.
That's the only thing I've been concerned about since our debut.

258
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,870
- Is he sensitive?
- Is it wrong for us to pull him?

259
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:23,080
If you guys verbally tell us, we'll definitely do it.

260
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,740
If he pulls like that,

261
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,680
we're going to lose our shoes.

262
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,880
We don't like it very much.

263
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,460
So, I should just tell you guys verbally?

264
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,160
So we are supposed to verbally lead you without touching you?

265
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,430
But do it as if you are pulling us along.

266
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,330
Okay.

267
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,270
I want to roll a large number

268
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,270
1!

269
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:58,940
You're reporting on a baseball all-star game, pissing off the players, and getting your butt whipped with a bat.

270
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,950
Over here!

271
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:08,090
- This way, please!
- Let's go this way!
- Come on, this way!

272
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,690
Hamada-san, this way please.

273
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,160
Don't pull them.

274
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,240
Wait a minute.

275
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:30,480
Hamada says he doesn't want to do it.

276
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,850
Does he wont  to do it?

277
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,150
He's not mad, he just doesn't want to do it.

278
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,920
- That's what a punishment is.
- Is he sick?

279
00:18:52,530 --> 00:19:00,470
He's willing to do anything different, but getting his butt whipped with a baseball bat is bad for his image.

280
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,440
What then?

281
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:11,180
- So you want to do it alone, Matsumoto-san?
- I see. Hamada-san does not have to do it.

282
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:19,860
But it would be strange for me to do it if Hamada doesn't do it. That would make the audience think that Hamada is selfish.

283
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,630
"Why only Matsumoto? Why doesn't Hamada do it?"

284
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:30,640
It's fine if I'm the only one doing it, but I don't want people to think Hamada is selfish. And Hamada is not that kind of guy.

285
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,940
Hamada is working very hard today.

286
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,510
He's wearing shoes.

287
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:45,080
(You are being pelted with a lot of pies by mischievous pop idols on a late-night TV show.)

288
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:59,600
They've overcome many obstacles and the game has entered its final phase.

289
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,470
8!

290
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,340
STOP!: Challenge The Gubernatorial Election.

291
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:17,320
You declare a number, spin the roulette wheel, and if the number you declared comes up, you win.
You get $500,000 to celebrate.
If you miss, you lose $100,000, which means you lose your job for a while.

292
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,320
Okay, that's not an option.

293
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,190
Now call out a number and then spin the roulette.

294
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,330
- It's 7.
- 7! Okay, spin the roulette.

295
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:29,460
- Will it come out, I wonder?
- It won't come out so easily.

296
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,000
The odds are 1/8.

297
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,240
Please pay me $100,000.

298
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,170
Hey, it's a 7 now.

299
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,940
It's 7.

300
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,080
Okay, that's enough.

301
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,350
If you guys are going to talk like that, I don't need the money.
I'm upset.

302
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:57,220
If you talk like that, I don't want the money.
Please continue the game.

303
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,360
That's enough.

304
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,130
If it were true, you guys would get $500,000.

305
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,000
That's enough.

306
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,970
It's okay, let's call it even.

307
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,970
- You are hit by intense cold weather during filming in freezing Alaska.
- Punishment game!

308
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,710
Cocorico do it to them!

309
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:28,590
It's already cold.

310
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:32,220
- So scary!
- Are you ready?

311
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,460
Here we go!

312
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,400
Let's go!

313
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,670
Thank you!

314
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,780
It's even colder because of Frisk!

315
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,350
Oh, it's cold!

316
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,360
Let's continue the game.

317
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,660
Huh?

318
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,300
- Football Hour!
- Spin the roulette!

319
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,630
No, no, wait a moment.

320
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,270
Our money is gone.

321
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,140
All we have is a promissory note.

322
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,440
You guys had a lot of money.

323
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,280
Yes, we had pretty good money.

324
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,250
Matsumoto-san?

325
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,450
Let's go, Football Hour.

326
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,650
Matsumoto-san.

327
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,820
Did you guys have this much money?

328
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,720
Go next.

329
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,960
Why do you guys have so much money?

330
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,990
- Did you guys have that much money?
- Yeah.

331
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,300
What the hell!

332
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,400
- You guys are in a lot of debt.
- You guys don't stand a chance.

333
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,610
- So we're the winners?
- Anyway, let's spin the roulette once.

334
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:02,550
Yeah, 8!
Goarl!!

335
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:05,420
- Okay, 1st place!
GOAL: The first to arrive gets the prize money.
1st place: $1,000,000
2nd place: $500,000
3rd place: $300,000

336
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,620
$1,000,000.

337
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:07,890
Is there?

338
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:11,490
