00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:06,980
Tonight's Gaki No Tsuka: Gabburi Chicken Finale!

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,570
Delicious!

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,540
Bon appetite!

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:20,000
The rules: They must finish an Oyadori (Hen) and Hinadori (Chick) at each store,

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:28,320
Furthermore, at each store 2 people will finish the 100g Fried Chicken dish assigned to them

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,500
They will repeat this for all 20 stores in the Tokyo Metro Area, and aim to finish them all!

7
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,570
If they're victorious, they'll win 100,000 yen

8
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,820
However, if anyone gives up the challenge is over

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,780
The person who gave up has to pay for all of the food eaten

10
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,330
Served with Daikon and Ponzu

11
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,320
You're so slow!

12
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,540
He is one of the 2 Lady Boys after all

13
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,120
It's too much

14
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,190
I can't eat that much!

15
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,080
Gaki's Light Eater Duo, Hamada and Hosei have been working hard,

16
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,260
Up until now, they've cleared 5 stores,

17
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,680
15 stores remain,

18
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,180
Will they be able to finish?

19
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:20,860

Translated by senor_wristband

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,140
After clearing the 5th store, they select the Fried Chicken eaters

21
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,160
First the SAFE people,

22
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,180
SAFE people,

23
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,740
Please! please!

24
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,740
Hamada!

25
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:43,460
What do you mean? This is the "OUT" table

26
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,460
You're wrong! He said it was the SAFE one

27
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,600
The first person out,

28
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,260
The wing flats are a pain...

29
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,180
The second OUT,

30
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:01,120
At the 6th store, Cocorico will eat fried chicken as a duo!

31
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,250
So, the 11th store is next...

32
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,120
6th store, it's the 6th store

33
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,350
Just pretend it is, just film it like it is

34
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,840
This is Tanaka-san's 3rd time

35
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,840
It is! It's my 3rd time

36
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,930
How would you rate your stomach condition?

37
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,670
Honestly?

38
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:23,180
I think 8...

39
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:27,020
Are you gonna give up? That's almost giving up!

40
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,400
No no, I'm fine I'm fine

41
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,680
If I was out eating with my family right now I'd say "No thanks"

42
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,540
I guess that makes sense,

43
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:38,450
I'd give up at an 8 too

44
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,520
If you were eating with your family, you'd give up at an 8?

45
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,470
Yes

46
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,530
Well it makes sense with how I feel,

47
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,130
I'd ask if there's dessert

48
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,330
You'd go until 10?

49
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,350
I wouldn't stop at 8 at all

50
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,300
The 6th store is here, at Ikebukoru Station's East Exit

51
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,500
The bone-in Hinadori, and Oyadori

52
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,500
That's the Oyadori?

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,180
Yes, we'll take it from there

54
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,480
First off is Gaburi Chicken's specialty bone-in chicken

55
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:16,140
The Oyadori is nice and firm, and the flavour spreads in your mouth as you chew,

56
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,700
Meanwhile the Hinadori is very tender and juicy

57
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,200
The Oya & Hina - A popular menu item that let's you enjoy both flavours

58
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,800
Look, I'm eating a huge piece of Oyadori

59
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,040
That piece?

60
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,860
It is huge!

61
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:43,440
Sunazuri? (Gizzard)
There's more than you'd think

62
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,000
Listen to the sound he made!

63
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,260
In terms of a firm bite,

64
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,260
It does have one right?

65
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,400
If you keep getting this, you'll be in trouble

66
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,920
Tanaka is on his 3rd plate of wings today

67
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,440
There's still meat left, what are you trying do?

68
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:11,060
Tanaka is acting like a convict...

69
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,060
No, no that's not true, that's not true

70
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,950
We all want to work together don't we?

71
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,360
Please check that out.

72
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,070
Move your hands!

73
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:24,000
Get your hands out of the way!

74
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:25,930
He's cheating a little bit

75
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,160
Why are you hovering your hands over it?

76
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,570
It's overflowing with meat! That is overflowing with meat

77
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,580
Here's the last piece.

78
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,780
Last of the gizzards

79
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,950
Hosei-san hasn't spoken a single word

80
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,960
It stuck out to me

81
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,280
Tanaka chews down to the bone and finishes as well

82
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,040
Did you see that?

83
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,880
He tried to get up...he OUCH!....went like this..

84
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,200
He got it wrong again?

85
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,070
He was trying to get up

86
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,730
What happened?

87
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,440
You weren't looking right?

88
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,480
His "wings" weren't big enough

89
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,480
His "wings"! Yes they were too small!

90
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,460
Picking the fried chicken eaters for the 7th store

91
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,160
The first person out,

92
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,530
I can't do it

93
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,640
I said I can't do it! This is my 4th time!

94
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,100
The second person,

95
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,100
Tanaka!

96
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,380
Already, Hosei is feeling the pressure,

97
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,780
His steps towards the 7th store are heavy

98
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,970
You complain a lot, whether that's good or bad...

99
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,460
Cause Tenders are...

100
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,950
Hosei-san cut that out please

101
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,950
I'm a Lady Boy you know...

102
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,120
Help me out!

103
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,740
What topping do you want for your Tenders?

104
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,870
How about Tartar sauce?

105
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,800
Chili tomato.

106
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,040
Daikon with ponzu.

107
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,800
It's the same as before!

108
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,080
I think for TV purposes you should change it

109
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,080
TV purposes ....

110
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,320
And of course my recommendation, whipped chocolate

111
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,470
That's a dessert

112
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,320
Actually, I do want to change the taste, at least

113
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,140
Let's get the Whipped Choco, yeah?

114
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,700
But also, Whip Choco-

115
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,080
Alright, Chocolate then

116
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,870
Why would you say something so pathetic?

117
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,590
Hosei-san, what happened?

118
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:53,330
Hosei gets Whipped Chocolate for his breat, and Tanaka gets Curry for his wings

119
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:58,000
Gaburi Chicken Food Marathon: They arrive at the 7th store in Suidobashi

120
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,700
You know it looks like we're gonna fail this time like always, that's no good

121
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,730
Let's betray the viewers

122
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,730
Let's betray them!

123
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,780
Thank you for waiting! This is Oyadori & Hinadori

124
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,290
This one is Oyadori

125
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,820
It's huge...

126
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,800
Take the one your chopsticks touched please!

127
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,870
Stop messing it up man

128
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,930
I was just checking

129
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:27,330
"Hmm is that too big?" - Cut that out

130
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,900
They're all the same size

131
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,200
The closest one? Is this the closest?

132
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,600
Sorry

133
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,500
So hard

134
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,880
The firm bite is nice right?

135
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,680
It has a nice bite to it, he means "hard" in a good way

136
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,420
It's really tasty, this skin

137
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,920
Even the skin is tasty

138
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,630
The Tenders and the Wings, please

139
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,160
Gabburi Chicken Marathon - Time for the 7th store

140
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,920
Hosei and Tanaka have eaten 860g!

141
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,440
For real?!

142
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,860
The Tenders

143
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,900
It's not what I thought it would be

144
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,630
It's not Chocolate, it's Whipped Cream

145
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:34,300
When Hosei saw that side dish overflowing with Cream...

146
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:43,150
He's turned into "Ashita no Joe". What happened?

147
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,230
He's not moving at all

148
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,440
This is just ...

149
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,440
Let's not fall into our old pattern though,

150
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,000
Like, "Hosei, once again..."

151
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,660
And they flashback to the Chocolate

152
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,360
Ah like "They should have stopped him"

153
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,660
Tanaka also got a topping, Curry to change the flavour

154
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,040
The wings here are huge!

155
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,580
I'm always getting this

156
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,900
That's huge!

157
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,470
It's huge! It's like they're getting bigger

158
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,180
But maybe with the Curry,

159
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,180
Yeah, I put some Curry on

160
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,080
It's nice to change the taste

161
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,720
That's the best one I think

162
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,420
This is seriously 100g?

163
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,860
This is actually really heavy

164
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,060
You can tell with the chopsticks?

165
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,100
What would you estimate?

166
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,480
Estimate? This is at least 120 grams

167
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,280
Just, is this really 100g? That's all I wanna know

168
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,800
It's 100g right?

169
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,060
How many did Hosei-san say?

170
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,700
(It's 100)

171
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,700
Hosei-san said 120

172
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,960
It's 100 grams. It's all good.

173
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,960
Even the store person had to tell you

174
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,700
Even after that, Hosei's chopsticks just won't move

175
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,500
Maybe try a bite with the whipped choco,

176
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,500
The taste will change

177
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,580
This works

178
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,580
It's good?

179
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,100
It's a dessert

180
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,780
So the main is the Tenders. It could work together.

181
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,900
Miracle

182
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,340
It's a miracle

183
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,970
He's doing it. The goal is almost there

184
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,220
Sorry Tanaka-san

185
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:52,420
The Wing check needs to be done

186
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,420
It's fine, totally fine

187
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,640
No way, eat it again

188
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:01,240
This area is fishy, this area

189
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,240
You gotta suck that off

190
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,240
I guess if I suck on it it'll come out

191
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,130
That's it

192
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,430
See? There was so much left

193
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:10,930
See

194
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,920
He's even biting it

195
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,300
He's eating so much

196
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,800
While Tanaka was sucking on that...

197
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,800
Sorry, excuse me

198
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,130
His cheque bounced

199
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,070
Don't worry, you can make it up somehow

200
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:37,190
He lost a lot of money!

201
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,900
This is really...

202
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,570
Really bad

203
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:44,500
He didn't tell his family about this

204
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,400
You just said changing the flavour helps you eat

205
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,640
Yeah it was amazing when he finished that one piece

206
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,640
He doesn't reply when you call him

207
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,000
And now he's become like this

208
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,780
There's also Tanaka's meat problem,

209
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,280
No it's not really like that-

210
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:10,090
Just going to the bathroom

211
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,500
There it is

212
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,240
From the 4 he had there's still 3 left

213
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:31,610
Should we go over to the washroom and just see what happened?

214
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:39,940
Because, you would expect, since Tanaka-san is finished...

215
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,000
Well he's not really finished

216
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:43,530
I am I am, I've totally finished

217
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,200
There's meat on there

218
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,860
It's not meat, it's bones I keep telling you

219
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,860
He's lying

220
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,430
I'm telling you it's bone

221
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:53,300
It's as good as finished, alright?

222
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,380
Hosei-san?  Everything ok?

223
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,070
Everything OK?

224
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,370
Everything OK?

225
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,780
Everything OK?

226
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,520
Feeling relieved?

227
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,330
Such a nasty expression that is

228
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,110
What situation is this?

229
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,110
Maybe he's playing Tsume Shogi

230
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,110
TN: Tsume Shogi is a game like Chess

231
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,720
I mean there's still 3 out of 4 pieces left

232
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,720
If it was just 1 left...

233
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,490
What state are you in? Just tell us how you feel right now

234
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,400
How I feel?

235
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,980
I can't eat anymore

236
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,520
Do you give up?

237
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,960
If you say that...

238
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,980
You're kidding right? It's only the 7th store

239
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,980
That's how I feel

240
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,570
Just his feelings

241
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,820
It's tenders, and only the 7th store

242
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,650
If I go with my feelings, I can't anymore, but,

243
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,180
I can't really end at the 7th store

244
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,760
And it's been me for the past few times right?

245
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,900
Tsukitei Hosei 51 years old - Makes a miraculous recovery!

246
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:32,100
Oh, there he goes!

247
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,120
He's doing well isn't he?

248
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,800
He's gotta use that too

249
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,800
Yes, that's important

250
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,500
What a man

251
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:46,530
Once his face starts shaking...

252
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,000
There it is, he's started doing that

253
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,100
He's eating it up!

254
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,900
He does that a lot in times like these

255
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,420
He's been drinking a lot of water

256
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:02,290
The water and the chocolate

257
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,760
He's going for it!

258
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,360
Now he always dips in that

259
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:15,970
Yeah

260
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,570
Such small bites

261
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,820
And finally!

262
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,930
Very heroic!

263
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:35,340
Hosei brilliantly used the Cream to finish! Time for the 8th Fried Chicken draw.

264
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,340
Alright, this one,

265
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,740
Out! Out! ... Out!

266
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:41,620
This person, this person has to eat

267
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,620
Hamada-san. Hamada-san!

268
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,020
Matsumoto-san. Well it's not that bad.

269
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,600
This person will be safe.

270
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,640
You're so delighted!

271
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,440
I don't care anymore, I don't care!

272
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:06,990
The Fried Chicken eaters will be Matsumoto and Fujiwara, both on their second plates

273
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:13,420
It's already been 4 hours. The enter the 8th store in Hongō

274
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,000
OyaHina OyaHina ... We've already eaten it!

275
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,510
OyaHina OyaHina ... We should've beaten it!

276
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:23,510
Hmm?

277
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,580
Your impression wasn't good at all

278
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,950
But you knew who I was right?

279
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,780
Takeda Tetsuya-san right?

280
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:32,450
If you can tell then it was a good impression

281
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,490
I thought you were gonna laugh at that...

282
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:37,860
I'm sorry for creating this atmosphere

283
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,160
Excuse us, thank you!

284
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,160
This one is Oya,

285
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,640
This one is a pain

286
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:03,220
He did barely finish the Tenders, but he has to finish the OyaHina too

287
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,800
Yes that's right

288
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,300
It's possible to give up on just the OyaHina

289
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,460
Yes, totally possible

290
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,500
That's huge!

291
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,500
This is your second time right Fujiwara?

292
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:32,030
Boneless Thigh

293
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,100
Matsumoto is also on his second plate. Neck, with Curry as a topping

294
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,580
Well yeah it has been a while since the first time he got Neck

295
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,580
He finished! So quick

296
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,220
Alright 2 sticks of Grease left

297
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,270
Don't call it Grease!

298
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,260
If it comes back up, that's gonna be...

299
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,530
The grease will just SLAM-

300
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,120
Stop saying Grease man, I thought we were clear on that

301
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,020
Alright he finished!

302
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,520
Amazing!

303
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:32,470
8th store is cleared! Next, the 9th Fried Chicken draw

304
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,240
The OUT person is,

305
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,250
Tanaka-san is OUT

306
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,480
There's still one left

307
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,360
The second one,

308
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,360
THE LOWEST ONE IS OUT!

309
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,360
The lowest person's card is out!

310
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,960
The 9th store's draw has picked Matsumoto and Tanaka

311
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,860
There's no sense of us working together to get to the goal anymore

312
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,600
This complete Mutual Destruction

313
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,600
When it gets to this point?

314
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,600
Yes

315
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,000
We're absolutely crushing each other

316
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:18,840
Next - Tanaka and Matsumoto destroy each other!

317
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:26,190
Gabburi Chicken marathon - After the 8th store, Hosei and Tanaka have eaten 1040g

318
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:31,760
The 9th store in Asakusabashi will be their next stage. A shocking turn of events await!

319
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,170
Hello excuse me, your fried chicken

320
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,670
You got that first huh?

321
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:47,080
Both of their servings were served on one plate ...
A merciless mutual destruction awaits!

322
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:50,200
If they do this...

323
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,420
It's fine if Tanaka and I eat half each, right?

324
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,240
Half each?

325
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,280
No listen,

326
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,400
I'll eat one of the wings, so...

327
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,800
Oh that's what you mean?

328
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,370
And Tanaka eats 3 Neck pieces

329
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:09,970
I just bring myself to touch the wings

330
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,500
That makes sense

331
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,170
Thinking back to before, that scares me

332
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,100
Wing, alright

333
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,660
So the Neck...

334
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:25,620
Huge!

335
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,620
You're kidding right?

336
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:32,100
This is 100g, right?

337
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:30,570
Surely there's no way!

338
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,440
We ordered by the weight

339
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,230
This is your 9th wing right?

340
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:41,120
Yeah, this is my 9th wing!

341
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,080
Ah Hosei-san you got Onion, I see

342
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,500
It does change the texture, certainly

343
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:59,400
On this series, we've never really seen Matsumoto-san like this

344
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,900
It's the first time, isn't it? It's the first time.

345
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,900
Yeah it is the first time actually

346
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,600
What's happened to him?

347
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,770
He's still got one whole wing left

348
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,680
But he finished one

349
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,680
You've really calculated your opponent there

350
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,800
Yeah you're right!

351
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,600
He's calculated what's gonna happen

352
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,800
You...

353
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,930
Really, Tanaka?

354
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,710
This guy...

355
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:20,130
He just stopped all of a sudden

356
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,670
He thinks he's gonna give up

357
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,870
I'm so pissed off

358
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:55,360
He's eaten the big ones. Half of them.

359
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,500
There's 11 stores left,

360
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,700
If we get to the next one, it'll be halfway

361
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,500
It's a cigar now

362
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,000
It'll feel the same no matter how you eat!

363
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,520
It's a cigar, straight up

364
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,520
So he's getting into the mood,

365
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,540
Something a bit different,

366
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,620
Like "Alright, I'm in a bar"

367
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:40,620
He finished his Neck cigar style. Only 1 piece left!

368
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:59,230
Hold on, he's-

369
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,800
He's crying

370
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,680
I'm sorry!

371
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,840
Ah! He's crying!

372
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,860
Is that a give up?

373
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:11,860
I can't anymore~!

374
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,960
He gives up!

375
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:18,300
I'm so sowwy about this

376
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,220
You were doing your best though!

377
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,550
So the 9th store!

378
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,780
The CLEAR was denied,

379
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:28,380
Hold on, this is agonizing!

380
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,900
You just couldn't get it down

381
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,920
The bill until now is 31,644 yen

382
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,880
I just wanna see, what would happen at the next card draw?

383
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,460
Should we pull out a card? This is who's out

384
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,000
I'd be done either way!

385
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,860
I would end either way!

386
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,780
It was a choice of two paths
