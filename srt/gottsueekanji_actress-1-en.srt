00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:30,580

5
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,380
Feeling nervous?

6
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:35,950
A bit

7
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,280

Taka-chan

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,700
Taka-chan, huh...

15
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,400
Can I call you like that?

16
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:00,670
Mh

17
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,380

I'm 32

19
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,420
And when was your... first time?

20
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,980
I was around 18

21
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:16,690
And your partner?

22
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:17,720
Older than me

23
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,660
I wanna ask you something

24
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:22,890
Where did you meet?

25
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,300
Yoron Island

26
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,740
I see, so you went on a trip to Yoron and...

27
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,910
It was my graduation trip

28
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,410
And how was your first experience in Yoron?

29
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:42,610
I was nervous

30
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,650
Let me guess... an hotel?

31
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,120
Nope, a guesthouse
