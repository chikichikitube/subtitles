1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:03,990
Our next presenter is this fine fellow. Come on out!

2
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,390
It's Tamura Kenji!

3
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,250
Thank you for having me.

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,240
From today forward, especially for Wednesday Downtown...

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,510
...we will be starting a brand new project.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,150
Why'd no one tell me?

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,810
So to kick things off, let's take a look.

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,810
Sometime in August.

9
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,810
I seriously had no idea.

10
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,150
They're cute!

11
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,390
So many cute girls.

12
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,590
Sixteen girls brought together for a reason unbeknownst to them.

13
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,090
They don't even know?

14
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,230
They don't know what they're in for.

15
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,310
Here he comes!

16
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,010
I'm so happy!

17
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,490
With hands like that,
it can only be him.

18
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,990
Kuro-kawa has arrived.

19
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,290
What's he gotta
do with them?

20
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,630
Wait, wait...

21
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,630
Eh? What's going on?

22
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,870
I can hear lots of voices.

23
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,840
Eh? Who's there?

24
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,040
There's chicks?

25
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,250
Why say it like that?!

26
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,330
Huh?

27
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,250
Just say "girls"!

28
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,730
Wait, are there lots of chicks here?

29
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,250
"Chicks" again!
What an idiot.

30
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,410
Eh? What's going on?

31
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,320
They gave me something.

32
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,900
Feels like there's a stand.

33
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,150
Ow!

34
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,610
What'd he even hit?

35
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,130
Eh? Am I OK to take this off?

36
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,290
Who is it?

37
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,030
Who's that?  Who's that?

38
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,330
Are you ok to just take it off?

39
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,800
Uwahhhh...what's this?!

40
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,580
What is this?

41
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,430
Is this a dating series?

42
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,610
We don't know anything about this either.

43
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,320
Her face...

44
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,080
You don't know?

45
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,150
So does that mean...I have to whittle 16 down to 1?

46
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,550
Eh? We'll be living together?

47
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,250
Living together...

48
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,190
He says it like he
wouldn't want it.

49
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,050
It's going to be the
same again this year.

50
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,190
This?

51
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,550
The monster is
out, after all.

52
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,660
What is it?

53
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,430
You know, on the
inside he's over the
moon about this.

54
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:34,340
"These sixteen girls before you are aiming to become idols."

55
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,170
"You, Kuro-chan, are tasked with selecting the members..."

56
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:43,890
"...and producing your own idol group."

57
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,890
You know this guy
is gonna fall for them.

58
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,310
This is bad.

59
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,210
A producer?

60
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,850
You want to be idols?

61
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,160
You can tell he's
really happy.

62
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,730
He's so happy.

63
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,290
Yes.

64
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,730
You can tell he's
holding back.

65
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,150
It's 'cause he
loves idols.

66
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,390
He's not troubled by
this at all.

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,600
I look forward to working with you.

68
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,230
So I really have to decide?

69
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:11,870
You can see right
through him!  Look
how happy he is!

70
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,430
I mean, it says right here "select the members."

71
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:13,750
Well...that means the examination has already started.

72
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,380
Well...that means the examination has already started.

73
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,920
We've already begun.

74
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,770
What the hell is
he on about?

75
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,220
So this is the power dynamic.  I understand.

76
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:20,950
So this is the power dynamic.  I understand.

77
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,980
So this is the power dynamic.  I understand.

78
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,950
Wow, he's really
full of it.

79
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,160
I understand my problem.  Yeah.

80
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,720
Whoa, whoa, look
at his face!

81
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,720
Yeah...

82
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,720
It got all dark.

83
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,110
I'm already scared.

84
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,110
I'm scared, but I
can't look away.

85
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:46,480
T/N: Kuro-chan's last series was "Monster House", a parody of the reality show "Terrace House".

86
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:46,480
"Monster Idol?!"

87
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,780
And so with that...

88
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,780
Is this allowed?

89
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,730
For him to...

90
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,970
I know he's your favorite, Hamada.

91
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,170
No, no, no, no...

92
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,060
Now, Kuro-chan really does love idols.

93
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,460
He knows every little detail, doesn't he?

94
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,270
Literally everything. Any live show he goes to...

95
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:07,200
...he takes his notebook, and writes every single thing down.

96
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,200
Creepy.  That's just creepy.

97
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,870
So that's why, this time, Kuro-chan will be becoming an idol producer.

98
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,870
He'll be producing?

99
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,340
He'll be producing.

100
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,340
Just watching this creeped me out.

101
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,740
He's putting on this concerned and troubled face...

102
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,780
...but you can tell he's incredibly happy.

103
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,750
This is impossible.

104
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,710
Tsu-chan, surely you've had auditions?

105
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,470
I've had auditions, sure, but we were just...

106
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,620
It's like that, I guess.

107
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,450
Imagine having Kuro-chan as a producer.

108
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:37,810
I assume that it was left out that they would be produced by Kuro-chan.

109
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,130
Exactly.  The sixteen hopefuls were only told...

110
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,990
...that this was an idol audition for TV.

111
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:48,450
We didn't tell them it was Wednesday Downtown.

112
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,710
So that what those sixteen knew when applying.

113
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,280
And that's all they knew.

114
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,280
If you told them that Kuro-chan would be the producer...

115
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,970
...I think a lot of them would have just quit.

116
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:57,970
You think so?

117
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,090
If we told them they can just leave when they want...

118
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,530
...there wouldn't be anyone left.

119
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,830
He'd be there alone.

120
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,350
But Shigemori, you went to an audition that changed your life.

121
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,670
Yeah, I did.  But I wouldn't want to be in their shoes.

122
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,190
But, they know if they leave...

123
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,680
...they're giving up the chance to appear on primetime TV.

124
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,870
So I think that itself is big motivation to stay.

125
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,250
In order to break into the entertainment industry...

126
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,180
...they know they'll be liked by perverts and bad people.

127
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,670
That's not the case at all!

128
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,930
Wait wait wait wait, that isn't the case at all!

129
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,130
Did you just come here to be liked by perverts?!

130
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,130
Hypothetically!  Just hypothetically!

131
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,100
She's not talking about herself!  It's just her experience!

132
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,100
Yeah, yeah, exactly!

133
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,050
This girl's an idiot.

134
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:59,380
Coming next: Monster Idol's first screening process begins.

135
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,510
No, this is just...

136
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:07,070
Here, Kuro-chan will be told his task again - in greater detail.

137
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,320
My name is Watanabe.  I'm a WACK representative who manages groups like BiSH.

138
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,390
Of course, I know who you are.

139
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,010
Yes.

140
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:18,010
So this guy is
pretty well know.

141
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,330
Wait, is this for real?!

142
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,470
It is, yes.

143
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:27,030
WACK, the company that produces BiSH and other idol groups...

144
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,030
...is managed by this man - Watanabe Junnosuke.

145
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,670
In this series, the members that Kuro-chan chooses...

146
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:37,970
...will debut under WACK.

147
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,050
By the way...

148
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,290
...in terms of the songs, the lyrics, the choreography...

149
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,690
...in terms of the songs, the lyrics, the choreography...

150
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,220
...in terms of the songs, the lyrics, the choreography...

151
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,650
...everything will be left to you to decide, Kuro-chan.

152
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,030
Is he for real?

153
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,930
Eh, me?

154
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:48,930
Yes.

155
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,130
I've never done anything like this before.

156
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,200
That's ok, we'll be here to support you.

157
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,830
So if that's the case, then...

158
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,670
...I can basically create my kind of dream idol group?

159
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,640
...I can basically create my kind of dream idol group?

160
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,290
...I can basically create my kind of dream idol group?

161
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,290
Exactly, yes.

162
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,440
The day is already flying by, and you still have 16 girls, right?

163
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,280
The day is already flying by, and you still have 16 girls, right?

164
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,440
I'm going to need you to get that 16 down to just eight.

165
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,410
I'm going to need you to get that 16 down to just eight.

166
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,980
Eh? Today?

167
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:08,980
Yes.

168
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,150
No, no ... isn't that too fast?

169
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,150
That's quick!

170
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,890
So, I have these cards for you to give to the girls you want to keep.

171
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,390
So, I have these cards for you to give to the girls you want to keep.

172
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,990
So, I have these cards for you to give to the girls you want to keep.

173
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,020
So, I have these cards for you to give to the girls you want to keep.

174
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,890
These cards allow them to continue.

175
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,630
Today there's eight.

176
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,430
Today there's eight.

177
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:25,750
For the first stage of the audition...

178
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,850
This is going really quick.

179
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,500
...the girls will go through a vocal check and some appeal time.

180
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:35,840
Using these two tests he must halve the group from 16 to just eight.

181
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,670
I've just wondered...

182
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,580
...these idols I'm making...are they allowed to have relationships?

183
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,980
...these idols I'm making...are they allowed to have relationships?

184
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,450
...these idols I'm making...are they allowed to have relationships?

185
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,020
I will leave that to you to decide.

186
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,690
For me to decide... OK.

187
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,490
For me to decide... OK.

188
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,270
Scary! He's so scary!

189
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,330
What's with that face?

190
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,850
He pisses me off.

191
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,310
Sorry about the delay.

192
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,000
He's so full of himself!

193
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,670
Walking around like he owns the place!

194
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,770
So, with all that...

195
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,870
...I now fully understand the complete power that I wield.

196
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,040
...I now fully understand the complete power that I wield.

197
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,210
...I now fully understand the complete power that I wield.

198
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,010
So if you don't appeal to me, it's no good.

199
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:13,950
So if you don't appeal to me, it's no good.

200
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:14,880
So if you don't appeal to me, it's no good.

201
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,510
So if you don't appeal to me, it's no good.

202
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,020
Yes.

203
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,140
So if you can't make me like you...

204
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,750
If you can't do that, then, of course, no one else will love you either.

205
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,550
If you can't do that, then, of course, no one else will love you either.

206
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,550
The hell is he...?

207
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,490
Think of me as someone you need to like you.

208
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:29,260
So, if any of you can't get through to that person...

209
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,430
So, if any of you can't get through to that person...

210
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:34,130
...there's no way you'll be able to fulfill the needs of anyone.

211
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,980
I can say that without any doubt.

212
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,580
Is that ok?

213
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,090
Is it really ok?

214
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,090
The hell is he saying?

215
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,040
This isn't a game.

216
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,440
Please do your very best to make me, the one with all the power, like you.

217
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,310
Please do your very best to make me, the one with all the power, like you.

218
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,150
Complete compliance.

219
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:48,580
Please do your very best to make me, the one with all the power, like you.

220
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,580
Gotta appeal to him,
don't they?

221
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,580
Yes.

222
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,080
Is it OK if I have a brief moment?

223
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,450
Is it OK if I have a brief moment?

224
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,990
Why is he laughing?

225
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,350
Let's talk about the next task.

226
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,320
I think I'd like to move on to the next thing.

227
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,150
You've got no hair!

228
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,960
Among them...

229
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,860
What hair are you moving?!

230
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,390
Baldy.

231
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:10,130
Eh? Thank you very much!

232
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,130
You've passed.

233
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:18,510
Aika

234
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,270
That was quick.

235
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,450
How do you feel? You passed.

236
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,170
Eh...I'm super happy!

237
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,510
Thank you so much.

238
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,810
Do you know why I picked you?

239
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,810
What the...?

240
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,550
No... I don't know why.

241
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,610
No... I don't know why.

242
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,270
It's because... you're cute.

243
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,420
It's because... you're cute.

244
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,390
Straight to the point.

245
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,620
Thank you so much.

246
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,760
Are you happy?

247
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,760
I'm super happy.

248
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,490
The hell?

249
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,490
What's up with
this guy?

250
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,210
Have you started to like me?  Just a bit?

251
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,200
Yeah, I really like you.

252
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,930
That's nice.

253
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:45,210
And with that, Aika has become the first successful candidate...

254
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:46,010
Why is this so gross?

255
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,440
..with only seven spaces remaining.

256
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,970
This is amazing. I
expected nothing less.

257
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,670
Continuing on...

258
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,990
Oh, she's good.  She's good.

259
00:09:54,990 --> 00:10:00,410
Hanae

260
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,770
Checking out their vocals...

261
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:05,870
Nao

262
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:10,650
Yuzu

263
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,370
How was that?  Did you sing with all your might?

264
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,370
Risa

265
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,400
I sang with all my might, for if I didn't I would live to regret it.

266
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,800
I sang with all my might, for if I didn't I would live to regret it.

267
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,690
I sang with all my might, for if I didn't I would live to regret it.

268
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,190
How much, out of 100%?

269
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,740
I feel it was 100%.

270
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,340
Thank you.

271
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,340
Thank you so much.

272
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,610
What the hell is he
talking about?!

273
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,270
She said "I feel like", which means she wasn't singing at 100%.

274
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,010
She said "I feel like", which means she wasn't singing at 100%.

275
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:35,610
With all sixteen candidates having their vocals checked...

276
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:39,840
...they move on to appeal time.

277
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,840
So, everyone... we've come together once again.

278
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,060
So, everyone... we've come together once again.

279
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,380
How does it feel? When you change locations, your feelings change too.

280
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,500
How does it feel? When you change locations, your feelings change too.

281
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,800
How does it feel? When you change locations, your feelings change too.

282
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:51,670
Ah, I can tell you're pretty nervous.

283
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,800
Ah, I can tell you're pretty nervous.

284
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,210
And I think that's just fine.

285
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,740
I really wish they'd tell him to shut up, just once.

286
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:06,890
With Aika already chosen, the
rest are split into three groups of five.

287
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:10,220
Aika

288
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:10,220
Akane

289
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:10,220
Hanae

290
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:10,220
Hinata

291
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:10,220
Kaede

292
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:10,220
Kana

293
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:10,220
Marika

294
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:10,220
Misuzu

295
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:10,220
Miyuki

296
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:10,220
Nao

297
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:10,220
Natsuko

298
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:10,220
Risa

299
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:10,220
Ryou

300
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:10,220
Sumire

301
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:10,220
Yuri

302
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:10,220
Yuzu

303
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,220
Starting with the first team...

304
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,140
What should we toast to?

305
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,170
What would you normally say at a time like this?

306
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,710
What would you normally say at a time like this?

307
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,050
Well, I'll go.

308
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,170
You'll start, Nao-chan?

309
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,170
Yes.

310
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:23,930
Nao

311
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,970
Cheers to Kuro-chan!

312
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,170
Aww thanks, cheers!

313
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,210
Also I'm not Agnes-chan, so Kuro-chan is fine.

314
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,170
Cheers!

315
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,270
Agnes-chan?

316
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,830
So...do any of you do any cute poses?

317
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:38,350
Any poses to show off your cuteness?

318
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,520
Are you already doing yours, Miyuki?

319
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,250
Miyuki

320
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,250
That's nice, but hold on.

321
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,320
Let me go in for a closer look.

322
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,070
This is embarassing...

323
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,290
Why are you looking down now?

324
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,130
Did you get embarrassed?

325
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,800
Ryou

326
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:55,650
The other girls continue to try and appeal to Kuro-chan.

327
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,330
Nao

328
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,140
Marika

329
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,970
So what's about you, Kaide?

330
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:02,990
Kaede

331
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,570
My cheeks are really soft.

332
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,010
Your cheeks are soft?

333
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,010
Yes they are.

334
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,880
Ah, they really do look super squishy!

335
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,080
They're super squishy!

336
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,790
This is my cutest feature.

337
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:11,750
May I? I'm kind of curious now.

338
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,090
May I? I'm kind of curious now.

339
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,090
He's gonna do it?

340
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,090
Sure.

341
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,670
He's gonna touch her?!

342
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,710
Well he's curious.

343
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,710
He's touching her!

344
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,710
He's touching her
really close.

345
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,130
It's like he's gonna
kiss her.

346
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,130
Yeah.

347
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,130
Yeah.

348
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,430
What are you doing?!

349
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,930
That's enough!

350
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,870
Just feeling this one side...I can't tell if anything's different.

351
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,270
Just feeling this one side...I can't tell if anything's different.

352
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,470
Can I feel both at the same time?

353
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,620
Yeah.

354
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,690
Gross gross gross!

355
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,210
They're nice.

356
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,380
No, they're really nice.

357
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,080
They're soft.  They're really soft!

358
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,790
They're soft.  They're really soft!

359
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,390
You've got something great there.

360
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,390
What the hell is this?!

361
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,050
So, Kaide... would you care to join me over here for a little chat?

362
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,450
So, Kaide... would you care to join me over here for a little chat?

363
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,020
OK.

364
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,320
The hell is he doing?!

365
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:52,680
Right here.

366
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,680
Excuse me.

367
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,010
It's like that, isn't it? You can't fully be yourself in a big group of people.

368
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,350
It's like that, isn't it? You can't fully be yourself in a big group of people.

369
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,660
It's like that, isn't it? You can't fully be yourself in a big group of people.

370
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,530
It's like that, isn't it? You can't fully be yourself in a big group of people.

371
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,530
This is just too much!

372
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,300
You're in a hostess club, dude!

373
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:13,710
Kaide

374
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,350
How do you really feel?

375
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,340
I'm actually a pretty shy person.

376
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,750
So, for me, personally, it's easier to talk when it's one-on-one.

377
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,370
So, for me, personally, it's easier to talk when it's one-on-one.

378
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,510
Wait, do you have a bit of an accent?

379
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,510
I'm from Hokkaido.

380
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,990
You're from Hokkaido.

381
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:12,990
Yes.

382
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,880
Honestly, you know...

383
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,450
Honestly, you know...

384
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:19,720
Kaede-chan, you know, I actually, um... I think you're really great.

385
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,950
Kaede-chan, you know, I actually, um... I think you're really great.

386
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:21,850
Kaede-chan, you know, I actually, um... I think you're really great.

387
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:22,750
Kaede-chan, you know, I actually, um... I think you're really great.

388
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,070
Kaede-chan, you know, I actually, um... I think you're really great.

389
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,070
Thank you so much.

390
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,350
Honestly, Kaede-chan, I really like you.

391
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,530
Honestly, Kaede-chan, I really like you.

392
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,130
He touched her!

393
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:28,630
Honestly, Kaede-chan, I really like you.

394
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,950
Honestly, Kaede-chan, I really like you.

395
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,060
Ah, I like you too.

396
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:30,950
Ah, I like you too.

397
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,400
Really?

398
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,290
I knew it.

399
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,400
Yes.

400
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,290
I knew this would happen.

401
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,370
What do you think of me?

402
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,670
What do you think of me?

403
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,640
I think you're...definitely different from how you are on TV.

404
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,470
I think you're...definitely different from how you are on TV.

405
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,210
You seem really kind.

406
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,440
I think the way you think and speak those ideas is amazing.

407
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,920
I think the way you think and speak those ideas is amazing.

408
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,030
I thought, "he really thinks things through and comes up with the right answer."

409
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,450
You know, honestly, even if this was a completely different idol group...

410
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,350
You know, honestly, even if this was a completely different idol group...

411
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,050
You know, honestly, even if this was a completely different idol group...

412
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,050
Why is he touching her?

413
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:57,590
I, too, wouldn't be taking this seriously so far.

414
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,800
I, too, wouldn't be taking this seriously so far.

415
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,430
But I'm creating my dream idol group, after all.

416
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,870
Why did he touch her?

417
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,660
You know, so I can't do this half-heartedly.

418
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,830
You know, so I can't do this half-heartedly.

419
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,230
If it was ok for me to do this half-heartedly...

420
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:09,170
If it was ok for me to do this half-heartedly...

421
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:12,330
I seriously don't think it'd end well.

422
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,330
Right.

423
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,330
Look, he's touching
her the whole time!

424
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,100
So, let's say...

425
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,810
So, let's say...

426
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,220
...we both like each other and were to go on a date.

427
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,710
Where would you want to go?

428
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,710
Umm...

429
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:23,110
I want to ride on a Ferris wheel.

430
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:23,110
Ah, nice!

431
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,850
I like Ferris wheels too.

432
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:25,850
They're so fun.

433
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:25,850
Yeah.

434
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,790
You know, really... I really... um...

435
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,420
You know, really... I really... um...

436
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:32,190
You know, really... I really... um...

437
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,560
You may be shy...

438
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,970
Hasn't he heard
of personal space?

439
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,000
...but no matter what happens, I'll protect you.

440
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,250
There it is!

441
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,150
Thank you so much.

442
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,250
His usual, "I'll
protect you."

443
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,670
About Kaide-chan... of course she's cute. Yeah.

444
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,170
About Kaide-chan... of course she's cute. Yeah.

445
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,140
About Kaide-chan... of course she's cute. Yeah.

446
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:44,470
She's cute, and she let me pinch her cheeks.

447
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,790
She's cute, and she let me pinch her cheeks.

448
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,940
When I said, "I like you"...

449
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,280
...Kaide-chan responded with a strong "I like you."

450
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,310
Kaide-chan will definitely pass.

451
00:14:53,610 --> 00:15:04,220
This project has already started.

452
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,010
It's only because
she wants to pass.

453
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:07,890
In this series I want to create idols.

454
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:11,900
In this series I want to create idols.

455
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,030
That's the name
of the game.

456
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,800
But I also want a girlfriend.

457
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,220
That isn't the purpose of this.

458
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:28,550
Nao

459
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,740
There's actually something I've been wondering about.

460
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,910
There's actually something I've been wondering about.

461
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,530
You listened to me sing in the examination, right?

462
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,980
You spoke to every single person.

463
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,310
You spoke to every single person.

464
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,710
Kurochan-san spoke to every single person except me.

465
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,550
Kurochan-san spoke to every single person except me.

466
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:29,710
You didn't say anything to me.

467
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:32,270
You didn't say anything to me.

468
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:36,190
As soon as I finished singing, all you said was "thank you."

469
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,670
And that was it, wasn't it.

470
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,430
I don't know if I come across as cold...

471
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,500
But I'm actually really interested in Nao-chan.

472
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,770
But I'm actually really interested in Nao-chan.

473
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,530
Really? How interested in me are you?

474
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,330
Really? How interested in me are you?

475
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,200
To be completely honest... the most.

476
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,210
To be completely honest... the most.

477
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,850
Really?

478
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:57,850
Yep.

479
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,850
You're not lying to me?

480
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:02,580
Does it look like I'm lying to you?

481
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,150
Yeah... well...

482
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:05,930
Yeah... well...

483
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,550
Nao-chan, actually I... like you the most.

484
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,990
Nao-chan, actually I... like you the most.

485
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,830
Nao-chan, do you like me?

486
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:13,960
Yes, I really like you.

487
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,830
Yes, I really like you.

488
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,230
No, no, you're
meant to be an idol!

489
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,970
He was just so close!

490
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:20,990
Right here... his face was right here.

491
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,870
Right here... his face was right here.

492
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,810
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

493
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,540
When he held my hand, I just...

494
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,310
She was creeped
out by him.

495
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,050
When he held my hand, I just...

496
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,710
...I just thought, "What? What are you doing at this time of day?"

497
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,920
...I just thought, "What? What are you doing at this time of day?"

498
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,920
...about halfway through him talking.

499
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,910
Are you quitting?  You should probably quit.

500
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,790
Are you quitting?  You should probably quit.

501
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,190
But I knew it wouldn't help me advance if I refused him.

502
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:38,890
So I thought I didn't really have much choice.

503
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,390
This one's strong.

504
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:46,220
Miyuki

505
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,550
The next candidate was so nervous...

506
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:46,220
...she was moved to tears during appeal time.

507
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,450
She's really crying.

508
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:51,200
Look, I will protect you.

509
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,170
There it is again!

510
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:51,200
Yes, please protect me.

511
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,670
I wonder what's wrong.

512
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,900
No, I really will protect you.

513
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,770
So, please, just do your best, in your own way.

514
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,130
So, please, just do your best, in your own way.

515
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,400
So, please, just do your best, in your own way.

516
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,970
So, please, just do your best, in your own way.

517
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,270
He's crying too!

518
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,970
Yes, I'll do my best.

519
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,990
They're crying together!

520
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,090
You have a tear.

521
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,990
Stop it! Stop it now!

522
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,690
This is just...

523
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,890
Ryou

524
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:18,130
The remaining candidates all get a one-on-one appeal time with Kuro-chan.

525
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:18,130
Marika

526
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,490
He spoke privately
to all of them?!

527
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,990
That's crazy!

528
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:22,630
Group 1's assessment time is over.

529
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,530
Staff: You've now seen all five of this group.

530
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,330
Staff: How would you rank them?

531
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,950
For me, Nao is number one.

532
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,330
Kaede is number two.

533
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,830
Third is Miyuki, I guess.

534
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,330
The girl who cried.

535
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,290
Number four is Ryou.

536
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:42,810
So number five is Marika.

537
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,080
Staff: In regards to Kaede-chan and Nao-chan...

538
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,410
Staff: ...you told both of them that you "like" them.

539
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,410
Staff: If they weren't here to become idols...

540
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,450
Staff: ...would you be
interested in them in a romantic way?

541
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:53,090
Yeah, well...

542
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,190
"Yeah, well..."

543
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,660
...I have fallen for them a little bit.

544
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,450
No, no, no, no, no.

545
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,870
Yeah...

546
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,130
The successful candidates from
the first group are announced.

547
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,130
That was quick!

548
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,350
So, I will now announce who's passed.

549
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,570
So, I will now announce who's passed.

550
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:06,230
So, I will now announce who's passed.

551
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,390
Miyuki, you've passed.

552
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,540
Congratulations.

553
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,710
Thank you.

554
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:18,570
But how will she
cope with all the
embarrassing stuff?

555
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,570
My thoughts exactly.

556
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,080
Kaede-chan, you've passed.

557
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,120
Yes.

558
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,120
Kaede-chan, you've passed.

559
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,290
Thank you so much.

560
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,350
Congratulations.

561
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,350
Thank you so much.

562
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,230
These are the successful candidates for today.

563
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,530
These are the successful candidates for today.

564
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,170
These are the successful candidates for today.

565
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:42,930
But why has Nao, who was ranked so highly, been eliminated?

566
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,310
But, after this, there will be another chance for you.

567
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,370
But, after this, there will be another chance for you.

568
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,880
But, after this, there will be another chance for you.

569
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,970
So, please return to the others.

570
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:52,010
Thank you very much.

571
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,090
What does that
even mean?

572
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,850
Why didn't he
pick Nao?

573
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:56,230
Staff: Good work.

574
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,230
Good work.

575
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,620
Staff: It's a shame you didn't make it.

576
00:18:59,090 --> 00:18:59,620
Yes.

577
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,770
I talked to him seriously about how much I want this.

578
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:04,560
I talked to him seriously about how much I want this.

579
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,800
And he said, "I know how you feel."

580
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:10,100
And he said, "I know how you feel."

581
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,130
But he ranked her
number one.

582
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,410
So I'm thinking he didn't understand me.

583
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:15,290
I am feeling a little bit betrayed...to be honest.

584
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,410
Of course you'd
feel that way.

585
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,390
I am feeling a little bit betrayed...to be honest.

586
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:27,490
Akane

587
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:27,490
Hanae

588
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:27,490
Hinata

589
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:27,490
Kana

590
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:27,490
Misuzu

591
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:27,490
Natsuko

592
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:27,490
Risa

593
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:27,490
Sumire

594
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:27,490
Yuri

595
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:27,490
Yuzu

596
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:24,210
And so he also makes his selections from groups two and three.

597
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:27,610
This makes seven successful candidates in total.

598
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:34,350
Aika     Kaede     Miyuki   Misuzu     Kana     Hinata     Hanae

599
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:34,350
Which means there is still one place open.

600
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,410
What will happen?

601
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:57,530
Aika     Kaede     Miyuki   Misuzu     Kana     Hinata     Hanae

602
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:52,390
These are the seven girls that Kuro-chan has chosen so far.

603
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:57,530
Which means there is one more place open.

604
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,740
This is painful to do, but I can only choose one of you to go forward.

605
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,820
This is painful to do, but I can only choose one of you to go forward.

606
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,590
This is painful to do, but I can only choose one of you to go forward.

607
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,030
This is painful to do, but I can only choose one of you to go forward.

608
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,250
This is just...

609
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,020
And that person is...

610
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,280
Nao-chan.

611
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,200
Congratulations.

612
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,420
Thank you.

613
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,750
Why not just
pick her earlier?

614
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:22,940
Nao-chan, please step forward.

615
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,280
Nao-chan, please step forward.

616
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,850
Yes.

617
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,350
Nine hours earlier...

618
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,770
Staff: So far, you've already made the first cuts.

619
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,010
Staff: So far, you've already made the first cuts.

620
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:35,170
Yeah, and you know...

621
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,890
...I'm not going to hold back now.

622
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,760
I want to have my proper explanation right at the end.

623
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,410
I want to have my proper explanation right at the end.

624
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:44,390
But I already gave away the first one.

625
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,910
Thank you so much.

626
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:46,570
You've passed.

627
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,370
Thank you so much!

628
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:53,350
Kuro-chan gave away the first card right off the bat.

629
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,580
The real reason for that was...

630
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,010
Seated next to her was Nao. She was the one I was interested in.

631
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,040
Seated next to her was Nao. She was the one I was interested in.

632
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,750
Seated next to her was Nao. She was the one I was interested in.

633
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,880
Staff: Oh, really?

634
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:01,880
Yes.

635
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:06,110
Staff: But you didn't give it to her.

636
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:06,110
I didn't.

637
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,320
You know...

638
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,630
Such a creepy face.

639
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,690
Basically, I wanted to see her cry.

640
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:11,570
Basically, I wanted to see her cry.

641
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:12,620
Huh?

642
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,500
I wanted to see her so relieved that she was moved to tears.

643
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,030
I wanted to see her so relieved that she was moved to tears.

644
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,910
I wanted to see her so relieved that she was moved to tears.

645
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,170
Nao-chan, how do you feel being the last person to pass?

646
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,200
Nao-chan, how do you feel being the last person to pass?

647
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,510
Nao-chan, how do you feel being the last person to pass?

648
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,010
My life is on the line, so I'll work hard.

649
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,230
She is seriously crying!

650
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:31,910
My life is on the line, so I'll work hard.

651
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,070
It's just as he thought!

652
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:36,670
Congratulations.

653
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,970
Thank you.

654
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,390
Just as expected, she really cried.

655
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,010
Just as expected, she really cried.

656
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,160
No, I saw those tears, I really did.

657
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,240
No, I saw those tears, I really did.

658
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,530
No, I saw those tears, I really did.

659
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,560
And they weren't super beautiful tears either.  They were real.

660
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,150
And they weren't super beautiful tears either.  They were real.

661
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:56,520
But seriously, she really cried how I thought she would.

662
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,600
But seriously, she really cried how I thought she would.

663
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,700
But seriously, she really cried how I thought she would.

664
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,110
It gave me goosebumps.

665
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,820
If she had just passed normally...

666
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,190
If she had just passed normally...

667
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:03,830
She wouldn't really think that much about me, would she?

668
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,830
She wouldn't really think that much about me, would she?

669
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,580
This way she'd be wondering, "why didn't he pick me?"

670
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,610
This way she'd be wondering, "why didn't he pick me?"

671
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:10,150
She'd be thinking more and more about me.

672
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,730
She'd be thinking more and more about me.

673
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:12,480
Then she'd start liking me more and more, right?

674
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,970
Then she'd start liking me more and more, right?

675
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:15,820
She'll like me more and more, and all those emotions will flow out.

676
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,670
She'll like me more and more, and all those emotions will flow out.

677
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,970
She'll like me more and more, and all those emotions will flow out.

678
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,740
In the form of that final tear.

679
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,160
This way she'll like me a dozen times more.

680
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,570
This way she'll like me a dozen times more.

681
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:34,040
And with that, the first audition for Monster Idol is complete, with these eight members.

682
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,110
You eight will be going on to the training camp.

683
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,810
You eight will be going on to the training camp.

684
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,180
You eight will be going on to the training camp.

685
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,180
I think I chose the best members, if I do say so myself.

686
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,780
I think I chose the best members, if I do say so myself.

687
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,820
You know, this isn't just a one day thing.

688
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,320
You know, this isn't just a one day thing.

689
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,020
At the training camp we'll be living together, so I can see your bad sides.

690
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,620
At the training camp we'll be living together, so I can see your bad sides.

691
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,230
At the training camp we'll be living together, so I can see your bad sides.

692
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,560
They'd think, "we have to unite and work together wherever we are."

693
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,260
They'd think, "we have to unite and work together wherever we are."

694
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,030
That's one of the many things idols have to be capable of.

695
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:56,760
That's one of the many things idols have to be capable of.

696
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,030
That's one of the many things idols have to be capable of.

697
00:22:59,030 --> 00:22:59,700
I have high expectations for the training camp.

698
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,600
I have high expectations for the training camp.

699
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:03,030
So, let's take the idol world by storm!

700
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,200
So, let's take the idol world by storm!

701
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,200
So, let's take the idol world by storm!

702
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:12,610
The stage is set in Okinawa.

703
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,830
What the hell?!

704
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,520
I want to pass.

705
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,550
What?! What?! What?!

706
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,050
He's touching this
girl again!

707
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,960
I hate liars the most.

708
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,460
Seriously, what
is he doing?!

709
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,150
I like you the most.

710
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,650
This is amazing!
So fun!

711
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,690
The person who will be leaving us tonight is...

712
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,450
What the hell was that?

713
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:47,230
What the hell.

714
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,850
What kind of company are you running?

715
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,510
He's proper mad!

716
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:57,390
Seriously, what is that guy doing?

717
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,270
Well, towards the end I was thinking...

718
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:03,610
...he may be able to pull off making an idol group, but...

719
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,030
...he's way too fast.

720
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,630
He is going quick!

721
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,630
He is blazing through!

722
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,570
It was like that from the start!

723
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,370
I thought it was going to end in that silence...

724
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,370
...but then suddenly that girl is shrieking "aaaah!"

725
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,590
Who was that?

726
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,590
What even was that?

727
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:18,380
Was something stuck down their throat?

728
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,680
Was something stuck down their throat?

729
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,650
Are you saying someone was choking her?

730
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:26,870
So what kind of company is this "WACK"?

731
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,450
They have groups like "BiSH".

732
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:32,670
They create a somewhat different kind of idol.

733
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,730
They get to be their real selves, right?

734
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:40,330
So, do you think having a group produced by Kuro-chan...

735
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:41,510
...is the kind of thing WACK does?

736
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:44,770
It saddens me to say, but you would be correct.

737
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,410
Is that so?

738
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,890
Shigemori, what did you think of it?

739
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:51,650
Once you get over the cringeyness of it...

740
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,470
Well...it....

741
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:56,230
...it's the best.

742
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,230
It became the opposite?!

743
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,520
It comes full circle.

744
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,350
Once you're over it, you have the feeling of euphoria.

745
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,720
Exactly! It made me want to watch even more!

746
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,270
Even though it's so bad?

747
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:08,260
It's just so fun!  It's the best!

748
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:39,230
