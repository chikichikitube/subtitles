1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
On tonight's Gaki No Tsukai,

2
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:14,240
With Suda Masaki,
Cookie's Woman Diver Classroom

3
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,520
Just stay there!

4
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,780
You dirty chimpanzee person

5
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,950
What will happen in this final part?!

6
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,030
Everyone, your Abalone has been stolen! Hurry!

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,790
Hey!

8
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:40,160
Over the 30 odd years of Gaki,
don't you think this is the worst episode ever?

9
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,390
They head towards a shocking climax

10
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,530
You idiots!

11
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,730
Worthless

12
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:55,870
Subbed by senor_wristband

13
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,960
Sensei, time for the next training

14
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,780
You know, as divers we need to be careful on land

15
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,150
Land is scary after all

16
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,800
We are people of the sea

17
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,590
Endo, what do you think the dangers of Land are?

18
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,090
Umm, there's a lot of crabs right?

19
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,090
On land right?

20
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,120
That's a good answer

21
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,010
Amazing, clap for him

22
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,730
Clap for Endo

23
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,840
That's alright please

24
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,270
Tanaka, what do you think?

25
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:30,330
/he commercial vehicles, like the ones moving containers /

26
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,110
Enough man, you're not even close

27
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:41,040
The commerical drivers are professionals!
They drive carefully and sound their horns!

28
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,250
Who's gonna hit you?!

29
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,650
With their shoulders? !

30
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:52,410
TN: I have no idea what Cookie is saying here, sorry

31
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,010
Your answer was way off, OK?

32
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,970
Sorry, I'm sorry

33
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,630
Suda, what do you think it is?

34
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,440
He really wants to know everyone's opinion

35
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,920
He really does!

36
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,200
We've said plenty already

37
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,670
I guess something to keep your body warm, like a jacket,

38
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:12,760
C'mon man, you really think there's people who go like this to warm themselves up?

39
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,960
Of course there are

40
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,850
I've never seen that

41
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,950
Do they come out of the water like this, holding an umbrella?

42
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,620
Like Nagabuchi in the opening of Tombo

43
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,670
Do they come out like that?

44
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,190
You're gonna get scolded

45
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,250
Huh? Like Nagabuchi, wearing that little hat walking out

46
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,950
They come out like this?

47
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:36,550
(sining the lyrics to the OP song from Tombo)

48
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,750
Move on already!

49
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:44,550
The scariest thing on Land - thieves that want to steal your haul

50
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,950
Look here

51
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,640
What's that, so off putting

52
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,890
Gross!

53
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,640
So gross!

54
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,890
When rehearsing for today I also jumped back at them

55
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,060
You gotta protect them, from being taken

56
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,930
Seriously,  you better protect these

57
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,690
Cause I'll kick you all in the nose

58
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,330
I'll wear some Doc Martins to do it

59
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,600
Ouch

60
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,480
I'll wear some Doc Martins that aren't on sale anymore

61
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,250
Tanaka used to wear those

62
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,120
I did

63
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,630
Oh really, today?

64
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:12,810
Not today

65
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,090
Back then right?

66
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,090
Back when I debuted

67
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,910
Then don't say "I wore those" you stupid little shit

68
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,640
Woah, woah,

69
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,670
It's not like Tanaka was the one who said it

70
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,900
Right?

71
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,130
Who said that?

72
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,120
It was me

73
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,380
Oh that's OK then

74
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,510
What's up with that?

75
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,460
He's really listening to his ribs

76
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,200
In last week's episode, Cookie-sensei was really harsh on Hamada

77
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,000
Sorry! I thought you were a really low ranking person!

78
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,150
Huh? What's that? I'm low ranking?

79
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:53,720
That pain remained with him

80
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,930
I felt a sharp pain when we made eye contact

81
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:04,460
Actually yeah seriously can I take a break?
Cause my ribs hurt

82
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,210
Everyone, let's take a break

83
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,830
We're taking a break?

84
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,040
Please wait over there

85
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:14,690
The training is paused for now

86
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:19,040
The anti-theif training will be resumed later

87
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,630
What's with that guy? Is he for real?

88
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,800
Yeah why did he take a break now?

89
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah, weird timing

90
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,690
Suda, is this good promotion? (for his show)

91
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,000
It isn't

92
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,930
This is like anti promotion

93
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,080
Anti promo?

94
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,590
5 Minutes Later

95
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,580
Hmm?

96
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,920
An old man out of nowhere

97
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,990
We can't let him come on set

98
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,960
We're filming something here

99
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,750
Excuse me!

100
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,840
Yeah tell him

101
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:06,020
Excuse me, sorry, we're shooting something here,

102
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,200
Oh OK

103
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,030
Sorry about that

104
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,440
He's got an amazing body

105
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,600
A great figure

106
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,960
Smart Phone

107
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,170
Don't film!

108
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,230
Oh no

109
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,310
Macchan

110
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,760
Can I shake your hand?

111
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,570
Sorry

112
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,930
Adachi, take him somewhere

113
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,570
Sorry, please,

114
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,130
Don't film!

115
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,590
Old man, don't film

116
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,590
TN: Tsukommi is the retort in a Manzai performance

117
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,590
Your Tsukommi is great!

118
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,650
Close, you're too close

119
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,490
It's troublesome if this goes viral

120
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,920
You're working right now?

121
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,710
Yes, we are

122
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,000
Good luck!

123
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,150
What a body

124
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,730
People like that don't really interrupt shoots these days

125
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,750
They don't yeah

126
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,220
Oh no, he's taking them

127
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,430
The abalone

128
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,140
Everyone, your abalone has been stolen!
Hurry, let's chase him!

129
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,460
Wait, this?

130
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,500
This was the training?

131
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,000
Stop, stop!

132
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,790
Everyone, your abalone!

133
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,580
Hold on, stop!

134
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,130
Hey, stop!

135
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:22,020
In the 30 odd years we've been doing this,
Don't you think this is the worst episode yet?

136
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:25,060
Wait, we can't go any closer!

137
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,140
Why can't we?

138
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,890
Damn it, we can't get any closer!

139
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,220
Why the hell?

140
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,880
Look, he's gone, he got away

141
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,620
Damn! We lost him!

142
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,820
Everyone, your abalone was stolen!
So unfortunate!

143
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,250
If only you guys were faster

144
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,730
We tried, but you stopped us!

145
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,460
We couldn't get any closer

146
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,620
What do you mean

147
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,380
You told us to chase him slowly

148
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:58,960
I did tell you to chase him slowly ... But we lost him!

149
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,560
What the hell are you on about?

150
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,560
What kind of act is this?

151
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,320
What happened Adachi?

152
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,370
That bastard, stealing your abalone like that

153
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,170
Where is he?

154
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,860
There he is

155
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,380
What is he doing?

156
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,130
Old man!

157
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,140
Sir!

158
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,590
He lives in there?

159
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,600
It does seem like that

160
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,900
Congratulations! We're having abalone!

161
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,210
Tell daddy thank you!

162
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:33,210
That one's for you

163
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,570
Ah, it's his family

164
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,140
Darling, good work!

165
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,850
He's showing off with stolen goods

166
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,460
I mean, a thief is a thief...

167
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,600
I guess we shouldn't confront him in front of his child

168
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,370
He's staring at us a lot

169
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,030
Our eyes met

170
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,970
These are some people I know, you guys eat dinner

171
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,120
What a nasty face

172
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:15,880
I-I'm sorry, for stealing your abalone

173
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:23,500
You know, if I was still young and healthy, I would get a job,

174
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:28,700
But at some point I became this old, and work became hard to find

175
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:38,610
That abalone you worked so hard for ... It was supposed to be our dinner
And now you know how we live, I'm sorry!

176
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,620
Please, raise your head

177
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,190
Everyone, I know it isn't much but,

178
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,870
I can give each of you, some Chrome Hearts jewlery

179
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,410
You DO have money

180
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,430
Isn't that more expensive?

181
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,120
You have money after all

182
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,650
That's silver

183
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,650
A tranquil break from training

184
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,690
It's definitely that

185
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,660
Definitely

186
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,280
It really fits him

187
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,190
What a beautiful bike!

188
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,950
It's brand new

189
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:18,810
Let's eat

190
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:25,780
Cookie-sensei wil treat the hardworking members to a feast

191
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,150
How do you want your sushi?

192
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,350
You're making sushi?

193
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:30,570
Yup

194
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,910
Eat up OK?

195
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,250
This "stall"...

196
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,190
It's warm today

197
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,110
I brought the toppings today so we'll be fine

198
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,110
But you know, today this,...

199
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,800
I am a bit worried

200
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,800
Will it be hygenic?

201
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,310
Let's start with Hama-chan's

202
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,530
Here you are

203
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,610
What is this?

204
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,610
It's CEO Osaki's hair

205
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,610
TN: CEO of Yoshimoto

206
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,790
It does look like that

207
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,530
It's not food

208
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:07,530
I Dogeza'd so comedically after cutting his hair

209
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:07,530
TN: Dogeza is the act of kneeling and prostrating before someone

210
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,790
My body was so low to the ground

211
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:14,560
I've got something for Macchan too

212
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,930
Let me put the topping on

213
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,410
What's that?

214
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,760
It's Miyagawa Tamako's hair

215
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,110
Her and CEO Osaki form a set after all

216
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:30,010
They were holding hands at the Okinawa Film Festival opening

217
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,250
You want some? You can if you want

218
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,360
It's yours

219
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,120
We're alright

220
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,430
He made it for you

221
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,880
Suda-kun, here's yours

222
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,950
A good one for you

223
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,730
Here, this is yours

224
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,170
It's all just hair

225
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:48,650
This is Megumi Yusuke's hair

226
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,200
It's turned that colour recently

227
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,010
It's got some Kosaki Gazuki mixed into it

228
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,440
Why'd you mix them?

229
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,850
Then, let's do Yamasaki Hosei

230
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,610
Something different now

231
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,400
Looks tasty

232
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,760
TN: Hosei's Rakugo master

233
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,760
This is Tsukitei Happo's skin

234
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,330
The master's

235
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,800
You're making me laugh! Let's move on

236
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,050
Suda-kun, let's move on

237
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,010
Woman divers are, after all, working women

238
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,770
They're powerful working women, so they gotta take care of their husbands

239
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:32,570
So let's train to take care of our husbands

240
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:33,690
What's that mean

241
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,430
This is a time attack, using a 3 wheel bicycle

242
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:44,570
They must rush towards their husband, who is sleeping 30 metres ahead

243
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:50,510
They must wake and dress him, place him in the bike, and set off

244
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:57,680
They must then prepare his lunch with lots of love on the way back

245
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:04,960
Will their fishermen husbands be able to make it?!

246
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,120
So this is about time, and, uhh...

247
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,750
The, uhh, style of the lunch

248
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,800
And the style of how you wake him

249
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,950
And, uh, the style of you placing him in the bike,

250
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:22,130
What do you mean by "style"?

251
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:25,830
What kind of word is that to use now, "style"

252
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,360
Alright Suda, sit down

253
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,550
Just sit down

254
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,840
What are we doing?

255
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,970
WHAT?!

256
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,510
I've no idea what you've been saying

257
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:39,390
I seriously want to punch you

258
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,030
Darling! Wake up!

259
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:52,490
Training to get the sleeping husband to the fishing boat on time

260
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,490
Suda takes the challenge first

261
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,760
Suda-san, let's go

262
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,590
Faster is better right?

263
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,640
Good luck, hurry

264
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,480
Darling! Wake up!

265
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,510
That's great!

266
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,010
Wake up!

267
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,430
He placed the bike well

268
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,560
The husband is not waking up at all

269
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,110
So annoying!

270
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,470
The husband is not cooperating at all

271
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,320
He should wake up from being treated like that

272
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,200
He's so rough

273
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,910
My husband won't fit

274
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,650
Stuff his knees in more

275
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,920
You can stuff knees?

276
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,360
That is a scary sound!

277
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,050
I thought that thing farted!

278
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,440
The lunch box!

279
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,090
The lunch!

280
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,110
There, right there

281
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,560
Woah, there's a lot

282
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,530
Eh? A lunch box?

283
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,720
I don't wanna do this

284
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,970
I straight up don't wanna do this

285
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,470
Hurry! Hurry!

286
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:16,470
Hurry! Make it with love!

287
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,010
Put your feelings for him into it

288
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,240
The husband isn't waking up at all

289
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,650
Man doing this in 1 minute is impossible

290
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,050
His time?

291
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,690
1 minute, and 43 theckonds - *seconds

292
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,080
What's a "theckond"?

293
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,040
That was the important part

294
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,590
Was that bad?

295
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:43,270
Garbage! Let's check your lunch

296
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,960
I'm opening it

297
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,150
Well...

298
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,160
Looks fine to me

299
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,130
I put cabbage in and everything

300
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,250
Cabbage? Oh okay then

301
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,450
Despite his performance, his score is 15

302
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,150
A score of 15, this is Idiot Time

303
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,010
Idiot Time, you know what I mean

304
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,790
Idiot Time?

305
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,250
You are IdiotMan

306
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:13,200
You are not Suda Masaki
You are Tsuketei IdiotMan

307
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,950
Tsuketei is unnecessary

308
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,390
Why is Tsukitei his surname?

309
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,870
Tsuketei IdiotMan?

310
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,770
Next, Tanaka takes the challenge

311
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,350
C'mon!

312
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,040
Hey wake up!

313
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,640
Hurry up!

314
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,400
Wake up darling!

315
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,580
Just look at him once

316
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,750
You need to get on that boat!

317
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,750
Wake up honey!

318
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,860
It would be nice if the buttons were open

319
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,600
Each button is worth 5 points

320
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,360
That sucks

321
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,240
He's telling you after you went

322
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,830
I can't remember a thing he said

323
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,410
He got him in though!

324
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,210
What a terrifying husband

325
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
He's in the Inugami Family

326
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:04,170
On top of taking too much time, there's another problem

327
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:04,200
Tanaka - 2 min 32 sec

328
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,470
Even Suda was faster!

329
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,470
Sorry, but this is not funy

330
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,490
That's no good?

331
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,530
Being upside down is fine, but these socks

332
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,910
This, this is just a swan

333
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:23,510
Another swan will show up, and they're gonna form a heart

334
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,740
A beautiful swan heart will be formed

335
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,800
That, is a huge problem

336
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,560
Who cares!

337
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:32,160
Why is that a bad thing

338
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,580
Are you not gonna do it Sensei?

339
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,850
Cause I'm just extraordinary

340
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,020
We want to see that

341
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:41,580
I'll just be like-

342
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,760
I wanna see that!

343
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,820
We definitely wanna see that

344
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:52,530
Cookie-sensei prepares before starting

345
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:59,130
A person of my class can do this one handed
I'm not bending my elbow

346
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:00,620
Cause I'm a man of my class

347
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:04,330
...Let's go

348
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,620
What the hell is he saying

349
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:15,020
Cookie-sensei is desperate to display his skills after those 2 went

350
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,780
So unnecessary

351
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:32,200
Amazing seating arrangement
Look at the angle his husband is at

352
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,130
A chaotic awakening for the husband

353
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:41,330
And the lunch box made with love;
Rice, and a single Takoyaki

354
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:44,010
Takoyaki isn't really a good side dish

355
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,180
THAT DEPENDS ON YOUR TASTES THOUGH!

356
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:54,400
That's just, c'mon man what a stupid statement! It's making me laugh, sorry!

357
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:56,530
What an annoying face!

358
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:08,240
It's time for Suda-kun to leave

359
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,620
Eh, really?

360
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,220
Yeah, get lost

361
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,840
What a way to say goodbye

362
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,440
Sorry, you aren't cut out to be an Ama-san
You're shit

363
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,200
I'm shit?

364
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,220
I worked pretty hard though

365
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,000
Then let's end this

366
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:24,310
Yeah, we can stop here

367
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:27,310
Don't drop out halfway, let's push on

368
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:30,390
Let's all point our sabres towards the sky,

369
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:36,390
"THE GLORY OF THIS SABRE, OUR BROTHERHOOD, THE AMA-FIVE!"
Let's do that!

370
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,310
We're the AMA-Five!

371
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:43,180
Well good luck then!

372
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:47,470
Thank you, thank you, excuse me

373
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,290
He's so lucky

374
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,200
This next training is our last,

375
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,600
Finally

376
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,560
For the next training, well, the sea is hard to work in

377
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:10,800
Since sometimes we can't find anything, we will train to steal from the Ama-san of the neighbouring town

378
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,100
We're gonna get complaints

379
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,180
Training to steal?

380
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:22,110
Cookie-sensei's training to steal shellfish

381
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,620
The winner is whoever steals the most sea food

382
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:36,330
However, halfway through a guard will appear

383
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:43,300
The members recieve bags to store their loot, and clubs for self defense

384
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:50,270
So let's begin
Sea Food Acquisition Training START

385
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:54,470
Steal please
Steal the sea food please

386
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:58,820
Whoever steals the most wins

387
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,420
Wait everyone!
The guard is coming!

388
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:30,620
Whoever steals the most, wins

389
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:35,200
Wait everyone!
The guard is coming!

390
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:53,290
Oh no! The guard is the Terminator!
Everyone, run away!

391
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,380
Run away everyone please!

392
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,620
Run away?

393
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:04,000
Wait, it seems his movements are slower than expected
Steal the fish!

394
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:09,800
Before he catches you, steal a lot!

395
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,180
We're counting on you-

396
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:16,930
Another guard has appeared!

397
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,270
Hmm?

398
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,490
He didn't leave?

399
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,620
He's supposed to be gone

400
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,760
It's Terminator's rival, T-1000!

401
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,040
What a terrible combination

402
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:31,330
T-1000 is here! What will happen!

403
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,380
This is...

404
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,730
This is just...

405
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,270
This is shi-

406
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,730
They're shaking hands

407
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,360
Fighting is Forbidden

408
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,370
Peace is Paramount

409
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,580
That is the meaning of,

410
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,580
Gaki no Tsukai

411
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,580
Gaki no Tsukai

412
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,110
Uh, no

413
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:57,570
This handshake brings peace to this city!

414
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:00,380
Matsumoto-san, let's just go home

415
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,960
We can leave now?

416
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,960
Yeah, there's no point waiting on them

417
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,220
You idiots!

418
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,620
Worthless!

419
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:11,240
Suda-kun was on his side all along

420
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:13,640
Yeah Suda was his collaborator

421
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,490
He had me fooled the whole time

422
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:19,200
PEACE IS PARAMOUNT

423
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:22,490
PEACE, IS PARAMOUNT

424
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,490
This is so exhausting

425
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,710
Good work

426
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,380
Good work

427
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,980
Thank you

428
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:41,180
KU! Come here

429
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,130
He wants to talk to you

430
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,890
Dinner?

431
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:52,170
So you and Suda were just messing with us?

432
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,510
From the beginning

433
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,540
Yeah

434
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,090
You're with him, right?

435
00:22:55,570 --> 00:23:00,690
I've been told this whole episode was his idea

436
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,770
That's horrible

437
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:03,660
There's no way I'd do that

438
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,110
He threw it away

439
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,800
There's no way

440
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,610
Before the shoot started, Suda came to rehearse with Cookie

441
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:15,310
Sorry about this Suda-san

442
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:21,090
This may be your first bad performance in your life

443
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,370
It's a wonderful thing to be unfunny

444
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,340
I guess I just have to do as I'm told

445
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm happy though

446
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,200
You're so messed up!

447
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,740
I set everything up?

448
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,170
You did all this for your sponsorship right?

449
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,460
What are you saying?!
