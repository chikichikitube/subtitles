START!!

124
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,480

00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:12,550
Starting Point

127
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,760
The starting point,

128
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,420
on a morning like any other,

129
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,450
Ordinary Morning

130
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,140
kindly welcomes the 5 men

131
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,560
The weather is just like the past years

132
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,960
It's always the same

133
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,880
It doesn't cheer us up...

134
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,990
I really don't think we need 5 people

135
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,260
Isn't 4 people enough?

136
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,020
You mean we switch in and out?

137
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,160
Anyone, don't you think 4 people is enough?

138
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,900
So that one persontakes a break?

139
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,630
So that one person takes a break?

140
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,100
Yes, they take a break

141
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,120
That in itself sounds hard

142
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,600
Do you have a problem with that?

143
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,700
The one who's resting will be worried sick

144
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,720
The one who's resting will be worried sick

145
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,040
No, I wouldn't be worried at all. I just want to rest.

146
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,580
No, I wouldn't be worried at all. I just want to rest.

147
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,280
No no no, what are you saying?

148
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,250
Right?

149
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,180
It's "Downtown's Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende"

150
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,600
Yes, that's right

151
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,650
I've never been told

152
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:47,480
Our pay is divided among 5 people anyway

153
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,600
Our pay is divided among 5 people anyway

154
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,600
YEAH RIGHT

155
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,280
That's not true

156
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,920
Right, Hosei-san?

157
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,940
That's not true

158
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,220
Wait here

159
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,060
"Wait here" it says

160
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,020
It's cooollddd

161
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,110

Amazing

164
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,780
Did he borrow that from Kon-chan?

165
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,940
Wow wow wow

166
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,420
Incredible

167
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,880
Hahaha

168
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,040
Wow, amazing

169
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,970
And the person inside is?

170
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,620
Of course

171
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,280
Everyone, good morning!

172
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,920

177
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,220
What a dirty face

178
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,630
Come back later, lose some weight, then come back

179
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,270

182
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,420
I just came back from the future but

183
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,910
Yoshimoto Kogyo had, in the Manhattan Metropolis,

184
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,920
Yoshimoto Kogyo had, in the Manhattan Metropolis

built a 300-story company building

186
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,880

187
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,250
I was so surprised!!

188
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,550
Who are you?

189
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:57,330
Uh... a scientist

190
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,290
Uh... a scientist

191
00:04:59,290 --> 00:04:59,750
Aaahhh no no no

192
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,250
Aaahhh no no no

193
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:04,540
Not a scientist...

194
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,600
What happened?

195
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,200
"Ah no no"

196
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:05,930
Natural comedian!!

197
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,830
Natural comedian!!

198
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,340
So uh, guys

199
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,600
By looking at this outfit, I'm sure you can tell

200
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,240
Oh, he's going to tell us here

201
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,470
This year's theme is Professors of Science

202
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,220
This year's theme is Professors of Science

203
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,900
What?

204
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:19,710
This year's theme is Professors of Science

205
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,780
This year's theme is Professors of Science

206
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,100
Oh, professors of science

207
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,220
There's a word like that?

208
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,840
No there isn't, if you think about it

209
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,510
Science and Professor are words, but

210
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,450
Science and Professor are words, but

211
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,350
"Professor of Science" doesn't seem to be a phrase

212
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,420
"Professor of Science" doesn't seem to be a phrase

213
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,500
You're Professors of Science!!

214
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,320
Matsumoto!!

215
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,660
Professors of Science or Yoshimoto: which do you like more?

216
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,170
Professors of Science or Yoshimoto: which do you like more?

217
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,590
Professors of Science

218
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,230
Even though you say that, I already know

219
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,130
Even though you say that, I already know

220
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,500
You REALLY like Yoshimoto

221
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,600
"Even though you say that"!?

222
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:57,610
endure 24 hours of rigorous duty

223
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:57,610
These 5 become rookie scientists &

224
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,780
With that,

225
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,560
the 5 men become rookie scientists

226
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,920
Why did they use that picture for Hosei?

227
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,960
and endure 24 hours of rigorous duty

228
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,860
I know, right?!

229
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,480
How spiteful

230
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,040
Moreover, you guys

231
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,850
call yourselves scientists, but what the hell are you wearing?

232
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,850
call yourselves scientists, but what the hell are you wearing?

233
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,960
Well you just told us, so...

234
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,880
Yeah

235
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,950
Your change of clothes are in those BOXES

236
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,420
Your change of clothes are in those BOXES

237
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,620
Can you go change immediately?

238
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,220
Isn't there a more scientific way to change?

239
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,830
Isn't there a more scientific way to change?

240
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,460
Yeah!

241
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:20,300
Before fulfilling scientists' duties

242
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:20,300
change into appropriate clothing

243
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,100
The first step to becoming scientists,

244
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,780
they must change into the appropriate clothing

245
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,670
It's just a box and a curtain

246
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,910
I'm going to get you all to come out one after another

247
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,380
First up, Matsumoto

248
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,500
You look good

249
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:39,220
Muscular Macho Doctor

250
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,180
Thank you very much

251
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,580
You're setting the bar high

252
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,100
Thank you!

253
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,020
You look like you could have an IQ of 200

254
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,140
Ahh, I might

255
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,780
Okay next, Endo!

256
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,490
Wish me luck!

257
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,140
Handsome as always you look good

258
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,900
Handsome Newlywed Doctor

259
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,060
Handsome as always you look good

260
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,060
Handsome as always you look good

261
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,290
He is newly married, right?

262
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,740
You look like you could win a Nobel Prize

263
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,860
I'll do my best!

264
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,700
Tanaka!

265
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,220
Oh, you look good

266
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:06,280
Lanky Dirty Doctor

267
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,620
You're looking a little lanky

268
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,400
but you look smart

269
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,440
Thank you very much

270
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,680
You're like the Edison of the Comedy World

271
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,980
"Lanky"

272
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,050
I appreciate it

273
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,300
So

274
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,480
Hosei!

275
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,900
Looking good

276
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,030
Naive Little Boy Doctor

277
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,220
Thank you

278
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,220
You look cute

279
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,940
"Naive little boy"

280
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,230
You look like you're squid-witted

281
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,600
Squid?

282
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,960
Quick-witted

283
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,070
Seafood?

284
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,440
You mean seafood?

285
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,060
Quick-witted

286
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,860
Quick-witted

287
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,920
Okay, Hamada!

288
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:38,610
Hamada is the only Female Scientist

289
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,300
Look at that

290
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,620
Female scientist!

291
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,610
Why are youthe only female scientist?

292
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,640
Is that what they meant?

293
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,380
Why are you the only female scientist?

294
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,200
What happened to you?

295
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,700
Female scientist!

296
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,550
No no I don't like it

297
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,250
No no I don't like it

298
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:46,750
Wait she's pregnant

299
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,460
Wait she's pregnant

300
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,020
He has to take caution

301
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,500
What a mess

302
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:59,430
She's pregnant!!

303
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,080
She has huge boobs

304
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,020
Pregnant...

305
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:00,850
Your pants: what are those pink frills?

306
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,340
Your pants: what are those pink frills?

307
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,840
What is that?

308
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,560
Sexy... garter

309
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,310
Sexy garter, is it?

310
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,060
Is it a sexy garter?

311
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,040
This shows up every few years, this sexy garter...

312
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,720
Yes, it pops up

313
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,500
Speaking of which "there it is", that wig...

314
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,320
Speaking of which "there it is", that wig...

315
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,300
Right?

316
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,140
No doubt about it

317
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,100
No doubt...

318
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,090
Apparently that's not a wig

319
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,390
Apparently that's his spirit

320
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,400
It forms via his spirit

321
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,130
It appears if he bites his thumb or something

322
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,370
It appears if he bites his thumb or something

323
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,020
Does it grow out?

324
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,880
This year's rules are simple

325
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:45,830
Train as rookie scientists for 24 hours

326
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:45,830
During training, absolutely no laughing

327
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:45,830
If you laugh, you'll receive a harsh punishment

328
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:43,140
For 24 hours, during their training, they cannot laugh, no matter what

329
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,920
That's all there is to the rules

330
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,680
So, uh, the

331
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,550
"Science Laboratory" bus will be here

332
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,980
Again?

333
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,420
Let's go then

334
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,980
No more buses, let's just walk

335
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,220
We're scientists but we still travel by bus

336
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,370
We're scientists but we still travel by bus

337
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,980
I'm fine with the bus; I just want to get there quickly.

338
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,400
I agree

339
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,900
I know that's not the case, though

340
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:11,790
Starting point

341
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,060
Finally, they are facing the harsh beginning

342
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,780
The relaxed mood has changed

343
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:16,080
Tensions are high

344
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,220
The tensions are high

345
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:16,880
It's cold-

346
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,880
oh, it's here!!

347
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,860
In that moment the 5 men saw

348
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,060
the bus that would transport them

349
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,620
This bus was

350
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,490
leaked all over Twitter and the like

351
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:31,460
leaked all over Twitter and the like

352
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,200
It was everywhere

353
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,080
It was all over the place

354
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,160
Guys, the bus is here

355
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,360
Guys, the bus is here

356
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,540
Of course

357
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,600
I can see it...

358
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,120
I know

359
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,480
Guys, look

360
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,260
Gaasuu Kurobikari Science Laboratory:

361
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,060
that's the place where you guys will spend your time researching

362
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,410
How is it? Funny, right?

363
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,680
How is it? Funny, right?

364
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,520
What? Funny?

365
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,860
It's not quite funny...

366
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,100
Not funny

367
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,650
Were you aiming to be funny?

368
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:55,750
Then it's not particularly funny

369
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,000
It's pretty average

370
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,220
Then it's not particularly funny

371
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:03,610
The bus to Gaasuu Kurobikari Science Laboratory

372
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,940
On the bus designed with Ein-suga-ein's face

373
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,920
On the bus designed with Ein-suga-ein's face

374
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,640
On the bus designed with Ein-suga-ein's face

375
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:14,830
They will set off to the Science Laboratory

376
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,660
they will make their way to the Science Laboratory

377
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:15,720
Everyone,

378
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,600
once you board the bus,

379
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,970
you’re not allowed to laugh

380
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,290
Everyone

381
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,180
When you feel you’re ready, then we’ll head off

382
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,410
Let’s board from the middle entrance

383
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,800
From the middle?

384
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,870
We’re going in this order?

385
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,260
It’ll start once we board

386
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,150
Aw man, then

387
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,600
Let's go

388
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,330
Shall we board?

389
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:30,670
Yep

390
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,030
It begins

391
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,050
Man, I don’t wanna start  but I guess it won't end if we don’t start

392
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,030
Ahhh

393
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,420
Man, I don’t wanna start, but I guess it won't end if we don’t start

394
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,050
That's right

395
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,230
That's right

396
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,870
It's gonna be hell

397
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,390
Okay, I’m gonna board

398
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:39,410
Let's go, shall we?

399
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:45,730
Do not laugh Scientists 24 hours

400
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,040
Okay I'm on

401
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:58,310
Only Tanaka isn't allowed to laugh

402
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,420
We haven't started yet, have we?

403
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,770
Say something, man

404
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,030
What are you doing?

405
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,220
How come you’re not getting on the bus?

406
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,650
Oh that's how you board the bus so I thought

407
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,690
Please get on the bus

408
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,030
You gotta be kidding me

409
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,650
It just popped out of nowhere

410
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,030
No wayyy

411
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,850
Aw come on guys

412
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,150
The timing was awesome

413
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,840
Tanaka's out, right?

414
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:23,990
He's out

415
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,570
We didn’t get on

416
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,240
Come on guys...

417
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,510
What the hell is this?!

418
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,310
Why aren’t you guys boarding the bus?

419
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,650
Wow

420
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:37,850
An ass whipping from

421
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:37,850
the Black Army soldiers

422
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,020
I feel sorry for Tanaka

423
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,420
That was crazy

424
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,470
That was bad, man

425
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,260
That was awesome

426
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:39,780
Alright let's go

427
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,720
Okay, okay let's get on

428
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,160

429
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,230
let’s get on, please

430
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,280
That was quite a hit

431
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,290
Okay let's do this

432
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,420
All aboard

433
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,870
That was awesome

434
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:45,890
Let's do this

435
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,380
Do we have to sit in order?

436
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,660
T/N: Matsumoto is using a foreigner accent

437
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,600
That messed me up real bad

438
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:56,170
Passengers already on board

439
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,820
Man...

440
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,340
We’re aiming for cheap laughs with that fart, aren't we?

441
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:58,870
We're aiming for cheap laughs with that fart, aren't we?

442
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,010
We're aiming for cheap laughs with that fart, aren't we?

443
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,510
Hahaha

444
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,640
But it was freaking hilarious

445
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:03,880
Is that so?

446
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,850
You just casually laughed

447
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,840
You just laughed

448
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,400
Yeah we’re aiming for cheap laughs

449
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,370
Yeah just now

450
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,090
That's right. I totally
forgot not to laugh

451
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,680
You're still laughing now

452
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,560
You just laughed

453
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,250
You're still laughing now

454
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,250
You just casually laughed

455
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:12,770
Really?

456
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,190
Let's get serious

457
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:22,130
As they set off to the Science Laboratory

458
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,540
As they set off,

459
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,660
what lies ahead for them?

460
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,530
Ahh so it begins

461
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,700
The year 2016

462
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:33,640
From now on they wont be able to laugh

463
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,500
From now on they wont be able to laugh

464
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,720
Within the bus, the atmosphere gets heavy

465
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:40,980
Laughing assassins lie ahead;

466
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:40,980
who will be the first special guest!?

467
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,600
For them, laughing assassins lie ahead

468
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,340
with the first being a special guest, who will it be?

469
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:48,520
Laughing assassins lie ahead;

470
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:48,520
who will be the first special guest!?

471
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,680
For them, laughing assassins lie ahead, with the first being a special guest,

472
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,500
who will it be?

473
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,590
So what’s your name?

474
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,060
So it's like that hey

475
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,730
Arrived at a bus stop

476
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,100
The platform's pretty low

477
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,000
That was quick

478
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,420
Ah this part

479
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:12,350
Detective

480
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:12,350
Inspector Zenigata

481
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:12,350
Suzuki Ryohei

482
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:12,350
Wakabayashi Masayasu

483
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:12,670
T/N: Suzuki is playing Inspector Zenigata from a popular manga series called Lupin the Third

484
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,950
This should be the bus

485
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,300
It follows the escapades of master thief Arsène Lupin III and Lupin and his gang are constantly chased by Inspector Koichi Zenigata of the ICPO, who has made it his life's work to arrest them, pursuing Lupin across the globe.

486
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,020
Yes, I received information that Lupin is on this bus

487
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:15,520
Yes, I received information that Lupin is on this bus

488
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,150
Yes, I received information that Lupin is on this bus

489
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:19,890
It's Suzuki  Suzuki

490
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:20,790
It's Suzuki, Suzuki

491
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,690
Oi you guys!

492
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,320
Until I find Lupin here, I can't allow you to leave

493
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,430
Until I find Lupin here, I can't allow you to leave

494
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:37,870
Arresting Lupin the fugitive

495
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:37,870
Inspector Zenigata’s mission

496
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,970
You will show yourself to us willingly

497
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,170
Zenigata...?

498
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,080
Inspector,

499
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:35,730
these 5 guys dressed as scientists, don’t they look suspicious?

500
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,260
Certainly...

501
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,880
It's a gut feeling we have

502
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,710
Lupin is certainly here

503
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,740
Lupin is certainly here

504
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,280
Well done, Inspector

505
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,080
Which one of these people might be Lupin?

506
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,080
Which one of these people might be Lupin?

507
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,120
Speaking of Lupin, he is a master of disguise, so it wont be easy to find him

508
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,920
Before we arrest someone, bring those guys in here!

509
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,390
Before we arrest someone, bring those guys in here

510
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,860
Alright, come in!!

511
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,100
What is it?

512
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:05,770
Endo’s father and brother board the bus

513
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:05,770
Lupin’s accomplices

514
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,080
What is it?

515
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:09,200
Already here

516
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,770
Already here, all of a sudden

517
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,200
Already here, all of a sudden

518
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:09,830
That was quick

519
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,660
Again, this year

520
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,160
That was quick

521
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,220
Endo's family is here again

522
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,690
Come on

523
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:15,720
Already

524
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,050
Hey Goemon

525
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:28,690
T/N: Endo's dad is playing Goemon. Another character from the Lupin the Third manga franchise, Goemon Ishikawa XIII is a renegade samurai that usually partners with Lupin in his exploits

526
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,350
Out of these 5 people, point out Lupin

527
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,160
Out of these 5 people, point out Lupin

528
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,220
I have no frickin' clue

529
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,230
He doesn't talk like that...

530
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,740
He hasn't done his research

531
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,550
He doesn't talk like that

532
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:36,940
You should do your research

533
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,200
You should do your research

534
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,490
What was that?

535
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,400
Who do you think you're playing?

536
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,110
Who do you think you're playing?

537
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,770
Looks like he's just winging it

538
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,300
No clue...

539
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,260
No clue...

540
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:44,760
He's just winging it

541
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,900
He's just winging it

542
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,410
Inspector, looks like this guy is keeping his mouth shut

543
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,740
Inspector, looks like this guy is keeping his mouth shut

544
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,470
Seems so..

545
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,890
You know what,

546
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,680
I just wanted to do a plug-in (to advertise) of my new TV drama

547
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,280
I just wanted to do a plug-in (to advertise) of my new TV drama

548
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,250
Why do I have be alongside this B-grade celebrity’s family?

549
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,720
Why do I have be alongside this B-grade celebrity’s family?

550
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,590
At the end of the year, why am I stuck in a show with comedians and

551
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,520
At the end of the year, why am I stuck in a show with comedians and

552
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,260
doing this serious skit with these idiots?

553
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,030
doing this serious skit with these idiots?

554
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,930
You don’t have to be that straight up about it!

555
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:07,910
I feel sorry for him

556
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,670
He's right though

557
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,430
You didn't need to say that directly

558
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:10,890
He's right

559
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,330
He exposed everything!

560
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,530
He’s so straight forward!

561
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:18,900
He hit my back

562
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,810
He’s so straight forward!

563
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,530
He was so straight up about it

564
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:25,160
You shouldn’t really say that, that was dirty!

565
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,460
But you know, what Lupin is a pro at disguising

566
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,750
however his weak point is a honey-trap

567
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,920
however his weak point is a honey-trap

568
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,390
Bring the recently arrested Fujiko in here

569
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,920
Bring the recently arrested Fujiko in here

570
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,890
Hey, Fujiko you're up!!

571
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,690
That means...

572
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,450
So that means it's

573
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,150
Yep

574
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,160
Heyy~ it's me, Fujiko

575
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:44,570
Endo’s mom boards the bus

576
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:44,570
Lupin’s accomplice

577
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,370
"Heyy~ its me Fujiko"

578
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,270
"Heyy~ its me Fujiko"?

579
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:47,330
T/N: Endo's mom is playing Lupin's love interest, Fujiko Mine. Although Fujiko usually works together with the others, she occasionally exploits Lupin's interest in her to steal the treasure for herself.

580
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,290
"Heyy~ its me Fujiko"

581
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,040
This is bad

582
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,250
There she is

583
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,170
Wow

584
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,900
She has no clue

585
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,970
The real Fujiko doesn't say

586
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,610
"Heyy~ its me Fujiko" she doesn't say that

587
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,380
"Heyy~ its me Fujiko" she doesn't say that

588
00:15:56,090 --> 00:16:08,290
Welcome Fujiko, Your se-

589
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,650
I’m wondering if-

590
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:58,920
Huh? what is it?

591
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,680
if we (his parents) can find Lupin

592
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:08,290
using this sexy outfit to lure him out

593
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,630
she just wants to deliver her lines

594
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,370
This is awesome

595
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,960
Oh my God

596
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,350
What is with her delivery?

597
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:13,490
Her delivery

598
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,530
The delivery of her lines is so stiff

599
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:14,630
The delivery of her lines is so stiff

600
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:14,730
The delivery of her lines is so stiff

601
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:16,230
The delivery of her lines is so stiff

602
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,170
Aw man this is bad

603
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,700
The delivery of her lines is so stiff

604
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:20,870
The delivery of her lines is so stiff

605
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:21,100
The delivery of her lines is so stiff

606
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,300
The delivery of her lines is so stiff

607
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,170
Let's see what she gonna say next

608
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,440
Out of these five,

609
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:32,250
Fujiko’s mission

610
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:32,250
Luring out Lupin using a honey-trap

611
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,690
in order, I will find Lupin

612
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,330
using my sexiness to lure him out

613
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,340
Come again?

614
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,250
Yes, you!

615
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,050
What do you think of this?

616
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,390
This is tough

617
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,220
Not really

618
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,520
Don’t you think I'm sexy?

619
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:37,520
Yeah...

620
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,330
Ah yes?

621
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,790
You look good for your age

622
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,770
Oh my goodness...

623
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,290
You're so cute~

624
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,260
What the hell is this?

625
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,190
Bam!!

626
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,940
What the hell indeed...

627
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,240
I have no idea what's going on...

628
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:49,620
That's right

629
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,230
What's going on..?

630
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,820
Ahh so this is how the new year starts

631
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,760
I have no idea...

632
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,010
This will never ever end

633
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,410
This will never ever end

634
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,780
Oy you are not doing a very good job!!

635
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,510
Oy you are not doing a very good job!!

636
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,010
Oy you are not doing a very good job!!

637
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,780
They're not gonna call us to come back next year!

638
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,620
I'm doing the best that I can

639
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,990
We won't be able to work together anymore

640
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:18,480
Fujiko VS Goemon

641
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:18,480
Inner conflict regarding mission details

642
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,910
I’m really doing my best

643
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,670
You should do it properly

644
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,070
Looks like it

645
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:17,350
I am!

646
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,940
You should try harder

647
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,870
You wanna fight?

648
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,670
It's been 40 years

649
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,470
40 years, wow...

650
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,740
Man this...

651
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,410
That was bad

652
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,010
That was a bad rip-off

653
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:40,810
A rehash of Ueshima and Degawa’s argument

654
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:40,810
Fujiko VS Goemon

655
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:41,100
They didn't do it very well

656
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,250
It's been 40 years...

657
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,820
Yes about 40 years

658
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,810
(Translator note: Endo's brother is playing Daisuke Jigen, Lupin's right-hand man and closest ally)

659
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,450
In front of my brother as well...

660
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,790
Hey Jigen

661
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,290
This fat lip lady is full-on giving you a dirty look

662
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,860
This fat lip lady is full-on giving you a dirty look

663
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:57,300
Do not engage with her at all costs!!

664
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,870
T/N: Endo’s brother is speaking politely with a bad attitude

665
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,870
What are you staring at?

666
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,690
I don't think I was...

667
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,810
Stop that, Jyunji

668
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:00,860
That's enough, Jigen

669
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,600
He’s speaking politely

670
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,410
I don't think...

671
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,270
What the hell are you staring at?

672
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,020
No I wasn't

673
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,210
Oy, big lipped freak

674
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,060
I wasn't staring...

675
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:11,850
Another rehash of Ueshima and Degawa’s argument

676
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:11,850
Jigen VS Hamada

677
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,050
I wasn't

678
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,490
You were staring

679
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,570
No, no I wasn't

680
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,440
You were

681
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,600
What are you staring at, huh?

682
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,280
I said I wasn't

683
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,210
Yes you were

684
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,530
What the hell

685
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,220
I'm sorry I didn't know

686
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,560
Man again this year

687
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,740
I know right

688
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,840
There's no escape

689
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,290
You just can't break away

690
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:23,310
Come on

691
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,130
There's just no escape

692
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,190
Once you're in that situation, there's no escape

693
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:27,360
Once you're in that situation, there's no escape

694
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,370
You heard what he said: he called you a big lipped freak

695
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:36,140
You heard what he said: he called you a big lipped freak

696
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,950
That was close

697
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,210
He was being so polite as well

698
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,910
I dunno, what should we do now?

699
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,250
That’s right, we have no other choice

700
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,810
Alright! Bring out the woman they call the "number 1 sexiest woman" in our police department!

701
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:55,160
The Police Department’s Number 1 sexiest woman

702
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:55,160
The last strategy to arrest Lupin

703
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,360
Yes that woman

704
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,860
We should be able to find the fugitive with this honey-trap

705
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,330
Please come in!!

706
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,130
Ahh I think I know who it is

707
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,260
Who is it?

708
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,400
Huh!?

709
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,630
Your wife!!

710
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,940
I am Cocorico’s Endo’s wife, Masami

711
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,640
Please come in!!

712
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,440
Ahh I think I know who it is

713
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,580
Who is it?

714
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,710
Huh?!

715
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:18,980
Your wife!!

716
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,300
That's my wife

717
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:22,920
I am Cocorico’s Endo’s wife, Masami

718
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,200
No way!

719
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:29,290
Infiltration of Endo’s wife

720
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:29,290
The last strategy to arrest Lupin

721
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:23,330
Hold up!

722
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,290
Oh my God

723
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,420
Hold on a second!

724
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,750
Ah, nice to meet you!

725
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:26,390
Oh my God

726
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,440
Hold on a second!

727
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,190
Wow the whole family’s here!

728
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,560
Wow the whole family’s here!

729
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,150
That's right everyone's here

730
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,930
Isn’t she Sekine’s ex-manager?

731
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,100
Yes, yes that's right

732
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,360
Isn't she Sekine’s ex-manager?

733
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:39,270
T/N: Sekine Tsutomu is a widely known comedian and actor in Japan. When Endo dated Sekine's ex-manager a few years ago, it became a big scoop in the Entertainment business.

734
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,180
You gotta be kiddin' me

735
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,550
I can't believe it

736
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,500
Thank you miss, please have a seat.

737
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,350
You serious?

738
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,850
This was also referenced in 2011/2012 "No Laughing Airport" Batsu Game when Sekine confronted Endo, taunting his love for "women working backstage".

739
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,970
Thank you miss, please have a seat.

740
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,480
Nice to meet you

741
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,640
You shouldn’t be here!

742
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,610
You shouldn’t be here! Seriously!

743
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,740
Are you being serious right now?

744
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:51,750
They already laughed, but please continue to enjoy

745
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:49,630
Miss

746
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,590
Today is a good chance to vent your frustrations

747
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:57,990
Last strategy to arrest Lupin

748
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:57,990
Luring out Lupin by venting out her daily frustrations

749
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,880
Vent to your heart's content

750
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,590
What is with this scenario?

751
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,590
Sho-chan,why won't you buy me a wedding ring?

752
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:03,690
Sho-chan, why won't you buy me a wedding ring?

753
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:04,690
I want a wedding ceremony!

754
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:05,720
Isn't it strange?Married with no rings?

755
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,730
Isn't it strange? Married without rings?

756
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,730
We talked about buying one later, right?

757
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,000
We talked about buying, right?

758
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,900
I've been asking for a whole year now!

759
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:19,870
It hasn't been a year. These things take time, like having kids...

760
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:19,210
1 year? That’s not right.

761
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,300
Awful!

762
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,140
It shouldn't take you that long.

763
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,640
You keep saying you're not in the mood!

764
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,210
You know I've beenwaiting for a second child!

765
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:27,350
You know I've been waiting for a second child!

766
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:27,910
Don't say such things on New Year's Eve.

767
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:31,320
Don't say such things on New Year's Eve.

768
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,590
Yeah.Your Dad, Mom and brother they're all here too.

769
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:32,850
Yeah. Your Dad, Mom and brother they're all here too.

770
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:33,490
Yeah. Your Dad, Mom and brother they're all here too.

771
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,420
Yeah. Your Dad, Mom and brother they're all here too.

772
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,160
I want a ring, and a wedding in Hawaii!

773
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,930
I want a ring, and a wedding in Hawaii!

774
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:40,890
Hear me? I want it, I want it!

775
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,130
Hear me? I want it, I want it!

776
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,230
Promise me!

777
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,070
Promise me!!!

778
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:52,070
What the hell are you doing!?

779
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,370
What was that?

780
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,210
Yes...

781
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:05,080
And here, Endo Shozo got married again!

782
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,080
What was the "Yes" for?

783
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,950
So, everyone, let's all sing together!

784
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,890
So, everyone, let's all sing together!

785
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:16,660
Ladybug Samba

786
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:12,790
This is ridiculous.

787
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,980
Absolutely! What was that all about?

788
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,340
Shozo and Masami in Wonderland,

789
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:30,810
got married in a Gaki no Tsukai bus sketch.

790
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:35,510
Embarrassed, Shozo got a gentle smile.

791
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:41,820
Now I have you all to myself.

792
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:47,160
However, my husband's habits remain.

793
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,960
A cheating husband wanders away...

794
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:59,000
Now he seduces the receptionist.

795
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,970
The lyrics are ridiculous too

796
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,000
What are these lyrics?

797
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,220
Really!

798
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,540
To his beloved Masami, Shozo said...

799
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:08,680
...if comedians don't cheat, they won't shine!

800
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:15,250
He has no taste in women, our pervert Shozo

801
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,990
I've never said such a thing!

802
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,490
The old man can't remember any of the lyrics

803
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:20,530
...gets rejected by the receptionist.

804
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:23,330
Memorize, old man, memorize!

805
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:27,230
Even the producer starts to get worried

806
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,230
What do they want from me?

807
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:31,600
But I still love my husband,

808
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:38,410
cheerful, I've become a celebrity's bride!

809
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,600
Shozo-san,

810
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,440
Masami-san,

811
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,300
congratulations!

812
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:47,350
Congratulations! Congratulations!
Congratulations!

813
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,350
Thank you!

814
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,220
So, shall we go?

815
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,360
So, shall we go?

816
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,390
Goodbye!

817
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:02,300
Hamada laughed a lot here.

818
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,970
What was that about?

819
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,580
It's finally over.

820
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,030
No kidding.

821
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,780
They even brought my wife...

822
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,300
About the Ladybug Samba (new lyrics)...

823
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:23,090
your Dad couldn't remember a word.

824
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:33,200
Endo shocked by his wife!!
The laughter assassins
won’t let them rest!

825
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,710
While shocked by the appearance of Endo's wife,

826
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,260
the laughter-punishments continue without rest!

827
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,260
We should be close now.

828
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,270
Yes, just a bit further.

829
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,770
I don't see any buildings yet.

830
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,740
That's a residential area...

831
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:45,040
PITSTOP

832
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,600
Do we get off?

833
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,340
No, not yet.

834
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,920
We're not getting off then.

835
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:55,620
Gekidan Hitori

836
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:55,620
High School Student

837
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:01,690
Kawashima,

838
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,360
why do you skip classes?

839
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:11,800
Seems he isn’t able to go to school

840
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,080
I won’t know if you don’t tell me!

841
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,970
Sensei...

842
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,970
I'm...worried about the entrance exams!

843
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:18,310
I'm worried about the entrance exams!

844
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,400
Worried about... the entrance exams?

845
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,020
Well, I’m the only one right?

846
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,560
Well, I’m the only one right?

847
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,650
Who probably won’t get into his choice of uni?

848
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:30,290
And my classmates will probably

849
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:33,160
make fun of me.

850
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,190
Kawashima,

851
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,060
everyone feels pressured by the exams.

852
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,430
You’re all in the same boat

853
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,030
And everyone in the class

854
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:42,870
wants to work hard together with you!

855
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:47,140
wants to work hard together with you!

856
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,140
Everyone?

857
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,100
That's right!

858
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:54,580
Sensei, now I understand...

859
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:00,990
Slapped by short-tempered teacher

860
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,060
Everyone's waiting for you!

861
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,620
Everyone?

862
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,060
You’re going to slap him there?

863
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,290
Sensei,

864
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,620
Everyone is waiti...

865
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,800
Are you going to betray them?!

866
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,810
I see... of course... I...

867
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,270
I see, of course... I...

868
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,740
??? (0_o) ???

869
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:19,910
What have I been doing until now?

870
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,740
What have I been doing until now?

871
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,840
Sensei, I...

872
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,740
You're supposed to be a man!

873
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,550
When one is in trouble,

874
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,750
the person who extends their hands to you is your friends!

875
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,280
the person who extends their hands to you is your friends!

876
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,680
That's true.

877
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,120
Kawashima,

878
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,120
come here!

879
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,660
No...

880
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,120
Comepart 2

881
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,090
Come here!

882
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,490
Kawashima!

883
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,040
Watch out!

884
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,730
That hurts!

885
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:48,230
He bumped his head!

886
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,270
He bumped his head!

887
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:54,860
Right here

888
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,740
Is he gonna be OK?

889
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,020
Kawashima~~!

890
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,180
They're still going.

891
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,970
Kawashima!

892
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,320
That's harsh...

893
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,840
Kawashima!

894
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,730
He's still shouting at him.

895
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,420
Let's go already; they got off.

896
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,220
This is getting on my nerves.

897
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,330
Kawashima!

898
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,290
Enough already, he said he would go to school.

899
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,180
"Go to school" he saidpart 2

900
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,920
"Go to school" he said, of course he'll get mad.

901
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,320
They're still going!

902
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,740
Kawashimaa!

903
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:49,580
Let's go to school!!

904
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,680
One hour since the start

905
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,650
Roughly one hour into the show

906
00:26:54,050 --> 00:27:00,540
Due to the endless punishments, the five’s tension dips…

907
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,620
Laughter assassins wait just around the corner.

908
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,920
More punishments await them just round the corner.

909
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,480
Laughter punishers
just round the corner

910
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,680
PITSTOP

911
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:16,220
What now?

912
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:25,830
Itao Itsuji
(Yoshimoto Creative Agency)

913
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,670
That's him, isn't it?

914
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,670
Yeah.

915
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,950
That's,probably *him*.

916
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,370
That's, probably *him*.

917
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:33,610
Cough

918
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,610
Cough

919
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,610
Cough

920
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,090
Ahhh...

921
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:38,740
In poor condition

922
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,850
thermometer

923
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,780
This is a continuation from last year, right?

924
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,160
You’re laughing!

925
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,740
The awkward silence, right?

926
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:11,380
Temperature measured

927
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,840
The silence is quite scary too, right?

928
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:15,980
No fever!!

929
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,460
Keep that kind of thing to yourself

930
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,710
Hey, what are you looking at?

931
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,610
Hey, what are you looking at?

932
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:42,340
What the hell do you want?

933
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:45,710
High School Student Fight

934
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,710
Are you one of them?

935
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,350
Don't fight, you two!

936
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,280
Itao-senpai

937
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,980
What?

938
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,450
This is the legendary gang leader who took over this neighbourhood all by himself.

939
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,590
This is the legendary gang leader who took over this neighbourhood all by himself.

940
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,420
This is the legendary gang leader who took over this neighbourhood all by himself.

941
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,920
Are you Itao?!

942
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,900
Damn, that was scary

943
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,400
Itao's mother

944
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,400
Matsuko Inugami

945
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,910
What is with that language?!

946
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:15,770
What is with that language?!

947
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,110
This child is Itao.

948
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,740
This child is Itao.

949
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,050
And what about you rookie scientists over there?

950
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:26,150
What is with those looks on your faces?!

951
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,690
Do you think this child is not Itao?

952
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:30,120
Do you think this child is not Itao?

953
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,530
Tanaka

954
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,400
Are you...

955
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:48,740
...feeling feverish?

956
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,580
I don't have a fever.

957
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:01,320
Let's just go to the lab already.

958
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,320
Tanaka, you measure your temperature too

959
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,360
Tanaka, you measure your temperature too

960
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:09,460
I don't think I have a fever...

961
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:13,200
We can't proceed if you don't do it

962
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,370
No fever, right?

963
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,770
Reluctantly measuring his temperature

964
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,820
I don't think I have a fever though...

965
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:34,790
Passing time with a magazine

966
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,780
Show me

967
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,230
T/N: 37 degrees Celsius is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit

968
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,230
Your temperature's 37 degrees

969
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,540
Slight fever!!

970
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,410
It differs from person to person...

971
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,600
That's right

972
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,230
Why are you 37 degrees, Tanaka?

973
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,250
You really do have a slight fever

974
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,970
Oh I see

975
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,830
Hand me that container

976
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,100
To be fair, he's right

977
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,600
It'd be troublesome if that was lost

978
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,470
You can't reset it

979
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,410
I've had enough!

980
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:50,250
It was a continuation from last year

981
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:50,250
T/N: Refer to last year's Itao skit

982
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:50,710
Yeah

983
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,210
It made me laugh

984
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:54,230
Bridging the years

985
00:31:55,020 --> 00:32:02,870
Drawing near to the Science Laboratory

986
00:31:55,020 --> 00:32:02,870
Only a bit left for the bus journey

987
00:31:55,020 --> 00:32:02,870
There is only a bit left of the long bus journey. They draw near to the Science Laboratory.

988
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:12,680
Drawing near to the Science Laboratory

989
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:12,680
Only a bit left for the bus journey

990
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:12,680
There is only a bit left of the long bus journey. They draw near to the Science Laboratory.

991
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:13,820
Everyone, we're almost there

992
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,320
Everyone, we're almost there

993
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,290
Yay

994
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:25,460
The bus carrying the five men draws closer to the Science Laboratory

995
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,500
Not the goal

996
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:30,240
However, this is not the goal, but a new battleground.

997
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:30,240
New battleground

998
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,270
We're here

999
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:31,600
Finally here

1000
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,270
Ohhh we're here

1001
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,870
Ohhh we're here

1002
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,270
We finally reached

1003
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:41,910
The stage for "No laughing"

1004
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:47,390
At this laboratory where new cells were found and laughter is life,

1005
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:51,990
New cells found and research where laughter is life

1006
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:51,990
the fierce battle with assassins of laughter begin

1007
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:57,110
Arrived at the Science Laboratory

1008
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:55,830
We've reached

1009
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,200
Ah, we're here

1010
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:00,030
Everyone, let's go

1011
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,180
Okay

1012
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,430
Okay

1013
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,390
Science Laboratory...

1014
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:07,510
Here

1015
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,410
Isn't it a wonderful laboratory?

1016
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:09,570
Isn't it a wonderful laboratory?

1017
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:14,030
Scandalous cells discovered?

1018
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:12,660
Medium-fatty tuna science...

1019
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,100
Sounds like some amazing cells

1020
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,080
Let's go

1021
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:22,040
Laboratory grounds

1022
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:22,040
Newest science laboratory. This is a school with quite a history.

1023
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,150
It's said that surprising is the case

1024
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:25,220
that funding for these type of places are not very good, for places like research labs.

1025
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,690
Everyone

1026
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,630
This is "that"

1027
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,700
The founder of Gaasuu Kurobokari Science Laboratory

1028
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,530
The founder of Gaasuu Kurobokari Science Laboratory

1029
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,850
This is a statue of the founder Dr. Ein Suga-ein

1030
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:40,670
Ein Suga-ein

1031
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:40,670
Science Laboratory founder

1032
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:35,680
Right

1033
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:39,390
Can you please stand in a line here?

1034
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:45,580
Alright, everyone?

1035
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,580
He said ''alright''

1036
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,380
Ein Su...

1037
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,550
That first line...

1038
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:00,390
Being outside is different from

1039
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,830
when we were in the bus.

1040
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:04,650
So

1041
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:09,430
Dr. Ein Stein, when he was a child...

1042
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:14,410
At that time, Dr. Ein Stein...

1043
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:14,410
It's "Suga-ein"

1044
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,150
Isn't it "Suga-ein"?

1045
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,530
"Suga-ein" seemed to have been difficult for him

1046
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:19,790
Is that so?

1047
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:21,400
Right?

1048
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,720
Fujiwara-san, please get it together

1049
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:32,720
At that time, Dr. Ein Suga-ein...

1050
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,860
Kawashimaa!!

1051
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:38,030
Kawashimaa!!

1052
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,900
Why do you not come to school!!

1053
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:44,100
Whip of love by a passionate teacher

1054
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,010
Whoa hahaha

1055
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,270
Stop, he said he'd go, didn't he?

1056
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:51,460
Stop, he said he'd go, didn't he?

1057
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,620
Oh man

1058
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,350
Dangerous

1059
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,470
It was bad

1060
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,870
Dangerous

1061
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,260
Aaargh!!!

1062
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,540
Why?!

1063
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,330
Stop

1064
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:11,730
He said he's going so

1065
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:12,660
Kawashima!

1066
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,650
Why do you not come to school?

1067
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,870
Everyone's waiting

1068
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,210
Nothing we can do but still...

1069
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,720
It's still continuing...

1070
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,150
It's scary

1071
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,120
Seems like they'll appear again

1072
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:37,940
Seriously

1073
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:41,390
I'll show you to the rookies' room now

1074
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,890
The explanation for this is over?

1075
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,060
Let's go

1076
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,700
I didn't quite understand

1077
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,600
The inside should be pretty clean

1078
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:57,580
Science Laboratory Entrance

1079
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,720
It's nice

1080
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,190
Yeah

1081
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,930
Over here

1082
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:01,350
Science Laboratory 2nd floor

1083
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,060
This place is huge

1084
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,750
It's spacious

1085
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,970
Everyone, over here

1086
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,760
It's here

1087
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:17,680
Rookie research room

1088
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,130
This is

1089
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:17,710
new... rookie scientists'... science

1090
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:21,380
research room. Please wait here for the time being.

1091
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,180
Aaargh

1092
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,960
There are probably gags and stuff in the drawers again

1093
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,680
9.30am in the morning. As expected,

1094
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:32,510
Science Laboratory - 1 hour 30 minutes since the start

1095
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,410
the curtain rises on that segment of gags

1096
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:37,550
What about the drawers? Shall we do it?

1097
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,550
What about the drawers? Shall we do it?

1098
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:41,040
Oh

1099
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,340
Shall we do it?

1100
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,300
Tanaka...

1101
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:44,270
Shall I start?

1102
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:48,090
The pattern of DVD for Tanaka

1103
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,580
Yeah, it's probably in there

1104
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:53,750
Thai kicks for 7 consecutive years via DVD

1105
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,400
What's wrong?

1106
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,400
Static electricity...

1107
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,010
I don't get it

1108
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:56,450
Yeah, DVDs every year...

1109
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,550
Scary

1110
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,150
Yeah, um...

1111
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,310
Things like push?

1112
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:04,440
Does it have?

1113
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,240
No...

1114
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,540
Uwahh, really?

1115
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:08,310
This is not a DVD

1116
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:08,980
This is a key

1117
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,980
Scary

1118
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:14,650
Mystery key with number 1 on it

1119
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,320
A key

1120
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,400
It has a "1" on it

1121
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,740
How about the other drawers?

1122
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,700
Open the rest?

1123
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:16,960
Ah, nothing

1124
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,430
Nothing.

1125
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:22,560
Nothing. Just the key.

1126
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,660
Nothing. Just the key.

1127
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:26,330
There's a locker with "1" on it. Shall we check it later?

1128
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,880
Locker number 1

1129
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,430
Or check it now?

1130
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,580
There's really a "1" on it

1131
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,570
Everyone, how about just opening your drawers?

1132
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:31,740
Everyone, how about just opening your drawers?

1133
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,290
There's a "1" on it

1134
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,510
I'm doing it!!

1135
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,240
The static's pretty strong

1136
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,410
Yeah

1137
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:38,390
Is that so?

1138
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,340
No more static

1139
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,150
There's something there

1140
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:42,880
Uwah

1141
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:47,440
Uwah

1142
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:53,930
T/N: a reference to an old prank variety show "Pioneer candid camera"「元祖どっきりカメラ」 which aired on NTV. It says "candid camera(pioneer)" on one side and "Prank success!" on the other side

1143
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:53,930
The pioneer candid camera signboard

1144
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,130
I don't really like this

1145
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,960
It's a little scary

1146
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:58,660
I have a bad feeling about this

1147
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,230
Nothing

1148
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,510
Ehh!!

1149
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,590
There's something!

1150
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,660
A set

1151
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,400
Yeah

1152
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,230
That's from that "Pioneer Candid Camera"

1153
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:21,320
Pioneer candid camera set

1154
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,520
It's a set!

1155
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,270
Yes

1156
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:35,920
Pioneer Candid Camera instruction manual

1157
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:26,510
1. Put on the helmet and tighten the chin strap

1158
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:26,510
Put on the helmet and tighten the chin strap

1159
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,060
2. Wear the vest and button up

1160
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,060
Wear the vest and button up

1161
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:32,150
Hold up the placard with your right hand

1162
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:35,920
3. Hold up the placard with your right hand

1163
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:34,170
What's it for?

1164
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:35,500
What's it for?

1165
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,980
So we're doing this?

1166
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,000
Tanaka, why don't you open that locker "1"?

1167
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,970
Tanaka, why don't you open that locker "1"?

1168
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,020
Should I open it?

1169
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,570
It's probably better for you to prepare

1170
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:41,810
That's right

1171
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:43,240
Ah... before I open

1172
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,340
I don't know

1173
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,290
I don't know

1174
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:45,840
I don't know

1175
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,050
Wear the vest

1176
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:47,810
Yes, the vest too

1177
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,580
This, should I wear this over my lab coat?

1178
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,550
This, should I wear this over my lab coat?

1179
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,150
Something like that, you should think for yourself

1180
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,180
That's right

1181
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:02,890
Does it suit me?

1182
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:04,410
What does he mean by "does it suit me?"?

1183
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,980
What's with "does it suit me?"

1184
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:15,110
Buckle the chin strap firmly

1185
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,140
Well, I'll open the locker now then?

1186
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,190
Wait

1187
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,870
No, as you lift up that lever like this...

1188
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:30,810
That's right

1189
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,560
Seems like there's a box here

1190
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,160
Seems like there's a box here

1191
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:32,940
Seriously?

1192
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:36,110
Really, what is it?

1193
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:40,550
Mystery Box

1194
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,950
Seriously scary...

1195
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,950
Various things will come out

1196
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,130
What is this?

1197
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:44,040
I'll open it okay?

1198
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,940
Wah

1199
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,060
What is it? What is it?

1200
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,440
Arrgghhh!!

1201
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,020
What is it?

1202
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,240
Scary!!

1203
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,540
What is it?

1204
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,210
Scary!!

1205
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:55,510
Can you turn it to face us?

1206
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:58,020
What is it? What do you mean by "scary"?

1207
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:02,190
A mysterious mask

1208
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:04,720
This is way too scary.

1209
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,890
Are you supposed to put it on your head?

1210
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:08,390
Wait, who?

1211
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,990
Can you see through it?

1212
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:12,000
There's something next to it.

1213
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,280
What's that?

1214
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:17,700
A neckwarmer?

1215
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:18,840
Try putting it on.

1216
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,170
Huh? Me?

1217
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:20,770
Yeah you.

1218
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,270
I mean you opened the box.

1219
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:23,470
Yeah it's definitely yours.

1220
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,560
Is this how you wear it?

1221
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,050
Now put the mask on.

1222
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:32,430
It's so you can't see his neck under the mask.

1223
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,350
Ah, you're right.

1224
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,850
It's supposed to look hyperreal.

1225
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,860
This is way too scary.

1226
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,720
Oh god, that's freaky.

1227
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,130
This is terrifying.

1228
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:41,590
Tanaka is really tall so it's even scarier.

1229
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:42,260
Tanaka is really tall so  it's even scarier.

1230
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,830
Tanaka is really tall so it's even scarier.

1231
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:43,830
That's true.

1232
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,480
Why would anyone even need a mask like that?

1233
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,570
Wait, stop striking that pose.

1234
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,090
Don't pose like that when you have that on...

1235
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,930
Come on Tanaka, stop it.

1236
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,730
What the hell is with that pose!?

1237
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,850
It really really doesn't fit the face.

1238
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,090
Tanaka, stop.

1239
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,840
No, wait, it's not like that.

1240
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,110
I just don't get the meaning here.

1241
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,450
That's all?

1242
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:38,180
Is that really it?

1243
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,470
I told you to stop!

1244
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:49,860
Take it off.

1245
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:49,860
Tanaka, wearing that-

1246
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,860
I'm telling you that's not it.

1247
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,400
wearing that-

1248
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,330
I really don't get it.

1249
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,370
wearing that mask while posing is already too much.

1250
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:57,740
wearing that mask while posing is already too much.

1251
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,140
Can I take it off for a second?

1252
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:05,040
Probably really hot inside.

1253
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:06,440
I don't really understand the point of this mask.

1254
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,610
I don't really understand the point of this mask.

1255
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:10,280
Why did Tanaka get it though?

1256
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:15,390
You said it, Tanaka is tall so having him wear it would be hilarious.

1257
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:19,940
aah- so embarrassing!

1258
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:19,940
being pranked with a

1259
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:19,940
whoopee cushion!

1260
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:27,700
A fake producer arrives to set up the prank

1261
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:40,040
the trap is set up and ready

1262
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,070
This is what they mean by prank

1263
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,580
A whoopee cushion...

1264
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,420
So, at some point you need to take the sign and-

1265
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:53,440
So, at some point you need to take the sign and-

1266
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,640
Miss Matsushita, this way please.

1267
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,130
The target is Matsushita Yuki, an actress.

1268
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,460
You really are useless...

1269
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,460
We do apologise for the inconvenience...

1270
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,400
Seriously, sort it out!

1271
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,850
I will, I'm sorry.

1272
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:10,780
Although they've all laughed, please enjoy the segment

1273
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:08,710
One more thing, that outfit we agreed on earlier...

1274
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:10,270
It's pretty damn ugly, isn't it?

1275
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:13,980
Where the hell did you get that outfit anyway?

1276
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:14,750
I will go deal with it immediately!

1277
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:19,380
Oh and also, listen to me properly next time!~

1278
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:23,850
The target keeps avoiding the trap.

1279
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:23,670
I said bring me a black coat, so why do you bring me a red coat?

1280
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,090
Yes, I'm sorry.

1281
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:26,140
Get your shit together, seriously!

1282
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,790
Please, excuse me.

1283
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,560
This is unbelievable...

1284
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:36,000
What the hell?

1285
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:41,370
What the hell?

1286
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:48,180
Replaying the scene in real life

1287
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:52,320
No no, they edit that afterwards...

1288
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,890
They edit it post-production!!

1289
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:57,120
Huh? What's this?

1290
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:57,960
Huh? What's this?

1291
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:02,590
The prank is a huge success!

1292
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,590
Wha-?

1293
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:02,610
It's this!

1294
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:06,160
Don't tell me it's a prank...

1295
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,570
It was you?

1296
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:07,980
Yes!

1297
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,550
Oh this is bad...

1298
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:10,900
You did this?

1299
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,170
Yeah, uh, I mean I didn't "do" it...

1300
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:11,470
Yeah, uh, I mean I didn't "do" it...

1301
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:13,070
Yeah, uh I mean I didn't "do" it...

1302
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,210
"I didn't do it"? So you're blaming someone else?

1303
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:15,840
"I didn't do it?" So you're blaming someone else?

1304
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,070
You're the one who did it right?!

1305
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:18,140
You've got "prank" written there!

1306
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:18,390
No! This is...

1307
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:20,810
Oh this is really bad.

1308
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:20,810
I'm

1309
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:22,150
an actress, you know.

1310
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:22,810
Yes.

1311
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,620
Apologise to me.

1312
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,200
No...

1313
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:25,950
What you mean no? Apologise right now!

1314
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:27,200
What are you waiting for? Apologise right now!

1315
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,800
Apologise properly!

1316
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:32,490
No, but I...

1317
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,490
Aahh! You're really pissing me off!

1318
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:33,490
A Thai kick! Someone Thai kick this man!

1319
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:34,090
A Thai kick! Someone Thai kick this man!

1320
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:36,090
A Thai kick! Someone Thai kick this man!

1321
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,290
Wait, wait a second please.

1322
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:43,630
I don't understand!

1323
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:45,640
Please wait a second!

1324
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,850
Oh man, I'm safe!

1325
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,410
Goodbye!

1326
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:50,390
What's with this storyline?!

1327
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,560
I don't get this, man

1328
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:56,210
No way to run.

1329
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:57,480
Yamazaki, you shouldn't move.

1330
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,200
Yamazaki, you shouldn't move.

1331
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,200
This is too sudden!

1332
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:03,620
AAGH IT HURTS, Oh GOD it hurts!

1333
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,940
AAGH IT HURTS, Oh GOD it hurts!

1334
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:08,160
Augh-ow! Just- ouch!

1335
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,560
Augh-ow! Just- ouch!

1336
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:08,990
Augh-ow! Just- ouch!

1337
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:10,660
Augh-ow! Just- ouch!

1338
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:18,200
This really is hell.

1339
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,600
It's so much worse when there's no way out.

1340
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:23,390
Wearing that hat is bad enough

1341
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:24,580
Well, nothing you can do

1342
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,910
Is the helmet hard to take off?

1343
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:28,380
Is the helmet hard to take off?

1344
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,630
It won't come off.

1345
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:30,720
Whoa, that's scary!

1346
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,420
Whoa, that's scary!

1347
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:33,700
They locked the straps?

1348
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,710
Man, this sucks.

1349
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:40,540
It should have been Tanaka.

1350
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:42,330
This year is different, it seems.

1351
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:44,760
When you get kicked,

1352
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,830
stop trying to appeal to us, okay?

1353
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:51,240
So you really can't take it off?

1354
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:06,050
That's yours now...

1355
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,590
Wait a second, wait!

1356
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:10,570
It's Son Goku

1357
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:17,160
It's been 2 hours 30 minutes since they arrived at the lab.

1358
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,430
There are still more traps waiting for them.

1359
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:20,730
Alright, my turn!

1360
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:23,000
Oh!!

1361
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,340
No way~

1362
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,610
Another DVD

1363
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,850
Another one?

1364
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:30,360
There might be even more.

1365
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:32,010
It's a bit different from last year, isn't it?

1366
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:34,910
It's a bit different from last year, isn't it?

1367
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,580
You're right.

1368
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:40,150
Nothing else, just this.

1369
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:43,270
Another DVD

1370
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:44,490
You have to watch it.

1371
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:46,690
Nothing good can come from this, for sure

1372
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:48,390
Nothing good can come from this at all, for sure

1373
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:50,340
Yeah, you're right, no way in hell.

1374
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:53,600
But we don't know if they're all the same.

1375
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:54,370
Well, I don't think it's gonna be another Thai kick.

1376
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:55,000
Well, I don't think it's gonna be another Thai kick.

1377
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,070
Well, I don't think it's gonna be another Thai kick.

1378
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:02,970
Here we go.

1379
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:03,790
Aaagh what's this one gonna be?

1380
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:06,410
Aaagh what's this one gonna be?

1381
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:07,460
50th anniversary surprise!

1382
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:07,460
Shouten!

1383
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:15,440
This is the real thing, isn't it?

1384
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:26,000
He's gonna show up too, then?

1385
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:27,980
What, what-what-what?

1386
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:29,950
Amazing

1387
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:37,190
Produced by Nippon TV

1388
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:46,650
Shunpuutei Shouta

1389
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:42,330
Ah, it's Obasan!

1390
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:45,720
Hello, welcome to Shouten, I'm Shunpuutei Shouta

1391
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:50,020
Right! Today's episode is a special, no-laughing quiz!

1392
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:51,590
Korakuen hall, Tokyo

1393
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:53,590
Doing a show without laughing is incredibly hard, but

1394
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:56,660
we'll give it our best shot, so let's go!

1395
00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:00,150
Begin the no-laughing quiz show!

1396
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:04,940
Shouten

1397
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:08,910
The quiz begins

1398
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:13,390
Is this really happening?

1399
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,110
Amazing!

1400
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:27,790
I can't believe it.

1401
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:44,220
Ah, it's this show.

1402
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,590
Thank you for waiting, let's start the show!

1403
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:51,350
Now let's hear their greetings to the Gaki no Tsukai cast.

1404
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:58,010
Sanyutei Koyuza

1405
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:55,270
Right, I'm a massive fan of many Gaki no Tsukai episodes

1406
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:59,360
like "Women's body I wanted to taste (kiki)," "Seven Sexy Outfits (Shichi-Henge)" and "Women's body I wanted to try (Absolutely Tasty)"

1407
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:02,430
These are definitely my favourites!

1408
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:05,430
I am Shouten's Fukuyama Masaharu, pleased to meet you.

1409
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:15,120
Sanyutei Kouraku

1410
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:14,560
I always get told off for not doing my jokes properly

1411
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,680
But today, we are not allowed to laugh

1412
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,660
So just like always

1413
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,030
I will not do my joke properly.

1414
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:25,150
Hey, Gaki members!

1415
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:29,470
Hayashiya Kikuo

1416
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:26,950
This 24-hour challenge sounds really tough

1417
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:29,240
You need to conserve your energy!

1418
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,620
I'll treat you all to some ramen later on.

1419
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:35,390
Except for Tanaka, you don't need to eat it though, since you are so damn dirty.

1420
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:37,390
Good luck!

1421
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:44,950
Hayashiya Sanpei

1422
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:42,630
Matsumoto? Do you still drink protein shakes every day?

1423
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:45,390
Hosei, apparently your wife is beautiful.

1424
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:47,390
Well, so is mine.

1425
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,390
...Anyway, I'm appearing on Gaki!

1426
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:53,940
My wife has never appeared though on it, so please get her on at one point, we are huge fans, Sanpei here!

1427
00:49:57,230 --> 00:50:02,970
Sanyutei Enraku

1428
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,900
For a long time, people have said I am a wicked man

1429
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:04,820
But I am nothing compared to you, Hama-chan.

1430
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:06,820
We are aware of your doings

1431
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:08,080
Secretly buying ivory

1432
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,060
Underground casinos

1433
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,060
Production of counterfeit bills

1434
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,780
Visits to the Kinshicho Hotel

1435
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,700
That's you!!

1436
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:16,170
That's you!

1437
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:18,540
Sorry about this year

1438
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:28,730
Hayashiya Taihei

1439
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:26,080
As this is the "No laughing" edition of oogiri

1440
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:30,180
I, Taihei, would like to wrap this up with a little riddle

1441
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:46,880
Whether it be New Year's Eve

1442
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:46,880
Or he spends too much time recording on set

1443
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:46,880
At the heart lies

1444
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:46,880
His worries for his rear-end

1445
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:44,510
I see!

1446
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:47,770
You're referencing the punishment!

1447
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:49,900
Please bring him out

1448
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:49,270
Yes

1449
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,050
Understood!

1450
00:50:57,270 --> 00:50:58,080
Alright everyone, altogether now

1451
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,610
Alright everyone, altogether now

1452
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:02,460
Tanakaaaaaaaaa

1453
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:06,130
THAI KICK!

1454
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,690
This ends our program

1455
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,190
Tanaka

1456
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:15,590
That was pretty exquisite

1457
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:19,260
That was pretty exquisite

1458
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,910
After all that

1459
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:20,960
I thought that was the end

1460
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,470
I thought that was the end

1461
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,520
It did say in the video

1462
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:24,900
Tanaka let's go

1463
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,740
But Tanaka actually be careful

1464
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:26,970
But Tanaka actually be careful

1465
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:29,210
I can't believe this exists

1466
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:29,210
Wait wait wait

1467
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:30,840
I thought it ended with Hosei-san

1468
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:32,090
It didn't end!

1469
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:33,160
There's no ending!

1470
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:33,660
There's no ending!

1471
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:35,280
Is this serious?

1472
00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:35,850
You gotta be careful, Tanaka

1473
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,080
Watch out

1474
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,460
Doing this every year

1475
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:40,250
Is this actually happening!?

1476
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,070
OW!! aaahhh

1477
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:43,190
OW!! aaahhh

1478
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,860
Watch out

1479
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:45,990
OW!! aaahhh

1480
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:47,060
OW!! aaahhh

1481
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:48,830
Watch out

1482
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:49,230
This is it

1483
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:50,260
Yep

1484
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:51,530
Oh, and this

1485
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:54,620
The suspicious part, his hell

1486
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:02,010
What was that "watch out" about?

1487
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:02,970
What was that "watch out" about?

1488
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:04,240
What made him say "watch out" from that?

1489
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:04,730
Maybe the corner

1490
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,310
He was about to hit his head

1491
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,250
You just went "watch out"

1492
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,460
Sorry

1493
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:10,880
Even in that situation, you say that?

1494
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,680
Even in that situation,\\ you say that?

1495
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,630
Yeah I'm surprised even in that state

1496
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,250
"Ouch" comes first like usual...

1497
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,120
Maybe see something else

1498
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:17,590
Is that normal?

1499
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:19,740
Maybe it's not that painful at all?

1500
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:22,030
Maybe it's not that painful at all?

1501
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,000
No, really, that's really weird

1502
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:30,880
That's definitely weird

1503
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:31,870
Tanaka, now that I think about it, that's strange

1504
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:33,500
Tanaka, now that I think about it, that's strange

1505
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:35,260
It probably wasn't that painful

1506
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:37,490
When I got itI couldn't see anything around me at all

1507
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:39,540
When I got it I couldn't see anything around me at all

1508
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:39,660
Right?

1509
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:40,710
Because the kick was so hard

1510
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:42,400
Yeah of course

1511
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:43,710
Wouldn't that be the situation for you?

1512
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:44,580
Wouldn't that be the situation for you?

1513
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,300
It was incredibly painful

1514
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,820
It's a Thai Kick, after all

1515
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:51,460
It was very painful

1516
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,220
But then you drifted that way

1517
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:54,270
The force of the kick

1518
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,270
moved me this way

1519
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:55,190
And into this corner

1520
00:52:55,890 --> 00:52:57,900
The corner right?

1521
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:56,630
Right here

1522
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:58,850
Onto where?

1523
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:00,780
The head

1524
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:01,900
Which is why I wentI went "watch out"

1525
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,150
Which is why I went "watch out"

1526
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,150
to myself

1527
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:06,650
We get that!

1528
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:08,490
You're not answering the question!

1529
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:10,240
You were fine then!

1530
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:11,580
No, there's no way

1531
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:12,030
Then explain!

1532
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,410
It's not like that

1533
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:15,030
Explain!

1534
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:15,310
Everyone's familiar withthe Thai kick's pain right?

1535
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:17,630
Everyone's familiar with the Thai kick's pain right?

1536
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:16,950
Well of course

1537
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:17,830
Yeah

1538
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:20,000
So everyone's familiar with that

1539
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:23,920
There are ones that hit hard and not as much

1540
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:27,390
Like every year,

1541
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:26,390
"Look at poor Tanakagot hit bad again"

1542
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:27,390
"Look at poor Tanaka got hit bad again"

1543
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:29,030
I was worried for him but then...

1544
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:29,630
he said "watch out"  so casually

1545
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:31,830
he said "watch out" so casually

1546
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:31,860
This one was a hit

1547
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:34,830
I thought "He's pretending it hurt"...

1548
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:35,050
Wait wait, I would never do that!

1549
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:35,730
If you haven't said itthen we wouldn't be talking about it

1550
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:36,600
If you haven't said it then we wouldn't be talking about it

1551
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:38,240
So that means if you got hit with a real kick Black Right

1552
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,240
Left and you're at the peak of your pain Right

1553
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,120
Then at the same time put something delicious in your mouth

1554
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,100
Then at the same time put something delicious in your mouth

1555
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:42,440
you'd say "delicious" instead?

1556
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:44,440
I probably would

1557
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:46,710
Let's get another kick in with those snacks over there

1558
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:47,640
Let's get another kick in with those snacks over there

1559
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,210
Wait hold on a second

1560
00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:50,410
Why?

1561
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:53,450
The last one was pretty suspicious

1562
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,130
Right

1563
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:52,850
Wait, no

1564
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:55,090
It seemed as if it didn't hurt at all

1565
00:53:55,090 --> 00:53:55,550
That's not right

1566
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,950
I agree

1567
00:53:55,550 --> 00:53:57,550
Not right

1568
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:57,590
Because

1569
00:53:57,550 --> 00:54:00,320
That man is an expert

1570
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,560
Sausage, great

1571
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:02,930
Tanaka, you like sausages right?

1572
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:04,360
It's not arabiki or anything

1573
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:08,030
Chiikama? (A cheese fishcake snack in the form of a sausage)

1574
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:08,920
It is chiikama

1575
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,270
This is good

1576
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:11,300
Now wait a second

1577
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:12,590
Put it in your mouth

1578
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:15,240
I think this would count as science if anything

1579
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,940
I think this would count as science if anything

1580
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:22,480
"Will the brain still react to delicious food despite

1581
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:22,480
a painful experience happening?" would be the name of the question

1582
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:24,280
This is profound

1583
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:24,980
The "watch out" being said so smoothly was just suspicious

1584
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:27,500
The "watch out" being said so smoothly was just suspicious

1585
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:32,260
Alright!

1586
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:34,410
Good luck

1587
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:44,250
I just think that's suspicious

1588
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:45,790
I wonder how it'll turn out

1589
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:48,790
Alright

1590
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:55,910
Eat it, quick

1591
00:54:57,110 --> 00:54:58,320
While you're in pain

1592
00:54:58,580 --> 00:54:58,820
Eat it. Eat it quickly.

1593
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:00,650
Eat it. Eat it quickly.

1594
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,570
How is it?

1595
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:11,360
That one looked especially painful right?

1596
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:12,600
"Don!"

1597
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:18,650
He didn't drop it

1598
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,550
It struck his core

1599
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,870
It's the type of kick where you're insides would blow out

1600
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:25,410
It was that kind of kick

1601
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:27,760
Just all out

1602
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:28,310
Of course that would happen

1603
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,280
This experiment proved that the first one probably wasn't painful

1604
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,200
This experiment proved that the first one probably wasn't painful

1605
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,390
It hurts so much...

1606
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:41,990
Are you unsure?

1607
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:44,730
If you're unsure

1608
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,730
We can do it again

1609
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:45,560
Where's the chiikama?

1610
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:46,760
You didn't eat the chiikama at all

1611
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,430
You didn't eat the chiikama at all

1612
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:50,200
Well? Give us an answer already

1613
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,940
Well? Give us an answer already

1614
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:52,190
You're not saying anything

1615
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:53,040
Did you eat it or not?

1616
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,170
Wait a moment, what is this?

1617
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:56,070
Wait a moment, what is this?

1618
00:55:56,170 --> 00:55:58,180
Were you able to say it or no?

1619
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,640
I wasn't able to

1620
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:00,260
Why not?

1621
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:03,210
Because it was painful

1622
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:04,380
So that means the first time wasn't painful then

1623
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,950
So that means the first time wasn't painful then

1624
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:08,690
Hm?

1625
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:09,050
They were both painful

1626
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:11,320
They were both painful

1627
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:12,560
Are you sure about that?

1628
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,320
If only you said "that was the second time" instead that would've been smoother

1629
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:16,660
If only you said "that was the second time" instead that would've been smoother

1630
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:16,640
We would've completely been convinced

1631
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:17,910
We would be convinced

1632
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:19,060
Maybe just hold it in your mouth?

1633
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:20,050
Hold it

1634
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:22,350
So I'll just hold it...

1635
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,930
But you've been touching it this whole time

1636
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,800
It's fine

1637
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,520
I wouldn't want that either

1638
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:30,840
Can we please switchchiikamas?

1639
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,380
Can we please switch chiikamas?

1640
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,810
That'd just be wasteful

1641
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:35,750
I've been watching you hold that thing like crazy

1642
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:36,010
Anyways, let's start in the position of you holding it in your mouth

1643
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:39,850
Anyways, let's start in the position of you holding it in your mouth

1644
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:42,220
With this thing?

1645
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:45,190
It's for science

1646
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:47,040
I really don't wanna do this

1647
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:48,730
It's an experiment

1648
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:50,790
If you said "The first hit didn't hurt" earlier

1649
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:51,630
No that's untrue

1650
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:52,130
Not true at all

1651
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:52,760
Not true at all

1652
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:53,360
Maybe if you said "Both were the same"

1653
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:56,370
Maybe if you said "Both were the same"

1654
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:55,450
That would be a bit more understandable

1655
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:58,190
But you guys understand this right?

1656
00:56:58,640 --> 00:56:59,970
So he should just hold it in his mouth?

1657
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:01,760
I really don't wanna put that in my mouth

1658
00:57:01,770 --> 00:57:02,710
It's been nonstop with Hosei-sanand that thing

1659
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,640
It's been nonstop with Hosei-san and that thing

1660
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,850
Here it comes

1661
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:20,320
I'm so done with this

1662
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,330
Why?

1663
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:23,760
Why is this happening?

1664
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,360
Alright

1665
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,210
Why is this happening?!

1666
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:28,170
You have to eat it quick

1667
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:32,700
Endo?

1668
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:34,840
How's the taste?

1669
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,210
How was the taste?

1670
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:36,970
Did you eat it?

1671
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:39,710
Why don't you eat it already?

1672
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:41,500
Maybe if he eats it now...

1673
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:42,410
Now's the time

1674
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:43,200
Pleas...Mh..

1675
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:44,150
How is it?

1676
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:46,420
UAAGH

1677
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,250
It's probably gross by now

1678
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,220
Were you able to tell the taste?

1679
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:56,330
How is it?

1680
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,610
Good?

1681
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,330
Why don't you tell us anything!?

1682
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:03,250
He was eating it this time, at least

1683
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:03,750
You're not telling us anything

1684
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:05,900
You're not telling us anything

1685
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,770
So...

1686
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:09,160
Did you like it?

1687
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:11,940
You didn't eat the *chiikama* at all

1688
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:11,680
Right

1689
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:13,540
I couldn't say anything

1690
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:14,190
Why?

1691
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:15,250
It... It was too painful

1692
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:15,580
It... It was too painful too painful

1693
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:16,580
It...It was too painful

1694
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:17,830
Then that means  that initial reaction was suspicious

1695
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:18,480
Then that means that initial reaction was suspicious

1696
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,520
Then that means that initial reaction was suspicious

1697
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:22,370
No no

1698
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,220
You're still gonna deny this?

1699
00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:26,660
It's wasteful, right?

1700
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:28,390
What're you doing with this?

1701
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,010
Are you crying?

1702
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:30,830
I am

1703
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:37,180
He's crying?

1704
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:38,540
Yes he is

1705
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:40,650
I saw the tears

1706
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:46,090
You can't cry!

1707
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:47,890
Oh, man

1708
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:49,610
It was painful

1709
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:52,980
It's 11:30 in the morning

1710
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:56,350

Alright everyone

1713
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:02,330

1715
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:05,800

A team exercise with other scientists

1721
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:14,490
With a certain purpose

1722
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:16,260

1724
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:18,710
"Let's get going," you say

1725
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:20,360

When the music starts playing, pull the double doors to open it

1735
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:35,580
Right

1736
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:47,920

1737
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:50,470

01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,430
we don’t really need this guy (Ebisu) do we?

1758
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:14,530
He’s our senior

1759
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:17,000
The skill balance between you guys are equal though

1760
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,140
He’s already losing hair as well!

1761
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:21,220
You've got a few people there

You’ve got Ochiken here as well

1763

Ochiken, my ass!

1764
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:25,560
T/N: Housei is a part of the Rakugo society, which is like story telling in the entertainment business. Junior is calling Hosei sort of something like an amateur storyteller.

1765
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,440
You love it, don’t you!?

1766
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:28,480
Why do you keep saying "Ochiken, Ochiken" over and over?

1767
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,620
He’s losing hair as well!!

1768

1769
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:33,250
Please don’t compare me to him

1770
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:35,550
To each their own

1771
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:36,990

1772
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:39,690

To be a top scientist

1783
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:54,870
Various observations are necessary

1784
01:00:55,370 --> 01:01:01,060
Everyone’s skill in daily observation will be tested in today’s game

1785
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:06,400

This will be judged by Junior-san.

1797
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:18,430

1798
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:23,530

Everyone, remember to follow the rhythm when you’re praising

1802
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:30,340
Don’t be too embarrassed in praising the person

1803
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:32,880
Just give us your true thoughts on the person’s positives

1804
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,860
Just mention the good traits; that's it

1805
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:38,130
This is a good chance to speak our minds

1806
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:38,130

01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:21,040
What kind of things?

1834
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:22,040

1836
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:24,610
What kind of things?

1837
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:27,180
Things like snacks like when we were working together

1838
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:29,500
Your voice is so friggin croaky!

1839
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,500
What the hell is wrong with your voice?

1840
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,240
What are you talking about? I can’t hear you!

1841
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,270
What kind of voice is that? It's so croaky man!

1842
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:35,490
Does it matter that my voice is like this?

1843
01:02:35,270 --> 01:02:39,480
Man, isn’t your hair falling out as well?

1844
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:38,960
Yes that is also true

1845
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:41,510
Is that a problem?

1846
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:43,510
Like have you ever given him anything?

1847
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:46,980
Yeah, there were a bunch of sweets and it looked like he wanted some

1848
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:50,420
He was hesitant, so I offered some to him

1849
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:52,290
Were they your sweets?

1850
01:02:52,490 --> 01:02:54,840
It was Tanaka’s
'Cuz it was on his TV drama show

1851
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,290
He was the top guy!

1852
01:02:56,290 --> 01:02:57,960
Okay then!

1853
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:00,980
It did happen!

1854
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:03,030
He will give you anything!

1855
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:05,000
He will give anything

1856
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,570
He has a good physique

1857
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:08,640
NOPE

1858
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:08,370
He's tall

1859
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:10,270
Doesn't he have a good physique?

1860
01:03:10,270 --> 01:03:11,390
He does have a good physique!

1861
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:12,260
Yeah he does have a good physique!

1862
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:14,460
His chin is well shaped

1863
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:15,910
Bad feature!

1864
01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:17,180
That's a bad feature, dude

1865
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:18,980
His jawline is sharp

1866
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:21,450
If the person himself doesn’t agree, then you are OUT; what did you think?

1867
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:23,470
I think it is an attractive feature of mine

1868
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:26,190
Seriously?

1869
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:25,070
What the hell?

1870
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:25,940
Are you kidding?

1871
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:27,120
Now you say it's attractive

1872
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:28,090
What the hell, man?

1873
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:30,510
He has a good physique

1874
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:32,760
I’m not fussy

1875
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,530
He loves kids

1876
01:03:34,530 --> 01:03:40,140
He cares for his wife

1877
01:03:35,870 --> 01:03:37,800
Huh? He said devoted husband!

1878
01:03:38,050 --> 01:03:38,520
That won't do

1879
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:39,440
You can't do that

1880
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:41,940
It’s the same thing as devoted husband, so OUT!

1881
01:03:45,410 --> 01:03:48,260
Yeah, boring, boring...

1882
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:51,680
11 rounds

1883
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:51,680
Miyasako

1884
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:54,450
They don’t have that many points either

1885
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:55,050
Wasn’t that exciting...

1886
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:56,720
Not even the production staff laughed.

1887
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:00,120
We are hilarious!!

1888
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:02,390
Let’s see them give it a shot

1889
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:04,710
You know what, the questions were shit

1890
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:07,830
and I ain’t that interested in Tanaka anyway

1891
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:15,270
Fujimon

1892
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:15,270

Next up is Team Fujimon

1899
01:04:10,270 --> 01:04:13,470
Can they break Team Miyasako’s 11-round record?

1900
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:17,790
This is taking forever, do we still have time?

1901
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:20,480
Aren’t our members hiliarious?

1902
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:20,480
Come on guys, line up please!

1903
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,430
Alrighty then

That’s totally not funny!

1905
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:27,850
Just do it

1906
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:30,170
T/N: Fujimon is referencing a popular Japanese tutoring commercial with the tagline "Ima desho" (今でしょ).

1907
01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:29,720
Just do it

1908
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:30,520

That was hiliarious!

1911
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:36,330
That’s the punchline, isn’t it?

1912
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:38,780
They're laughing

1913
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:38,830
It was freakin' hilarious

1914
01:04:38,830 --> 01:04:40,000

He’s got a cute beard

1920
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:58,330
On the second round?

1921
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:58,330
On the second round??

1922
01:04:58,580 --> 01:04:59,520
What?

1923
01:04:59,030 --> 01:04:59,870
It's just the second round

1924
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,050
It is cute, isn't it?

1925
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:04,520
Your second praise is “He’s got a cute beard”

1926
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:06,890
Hold up, hold up

1927
01:05:08,930 --> 01:05:10,560
It IS cute

1928
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:13,860
To prove that you mean it, you gotta kiss him

1929
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:16,370
Kiss him if you think it’s cute!

1930
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:18,870
You gotta kiss him

1931
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,720
It's cute, right?

1932
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:23,610
This is getting intense

1933
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,270
If you don't, you're out

1934
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:23,490
If you think so, then please kiss him

1935
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:30,880
I think Fujimon is a bit of a fairy, so no thanks

1936
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,280
I want to!

1937
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:35,150

01:05:47,830 --> 01:05:51,600
My lips are like tingling right now

1942
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:51,450
It was the beard

1943
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:54,370
Okay you proved it

1944
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:53,500
That was just the second round

1945
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,740
Okay second round was

01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:58,440

1956
01:06:22,430 --> 01:06:24,500
If you really think so, please kiss him

1957
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:28,640

He’s a hard worker

1963
01:06:40,050 --> 01:06:42,390

01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:52,660
He totally sucks!

01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:56,100
You couldn’t even get one right!

1969
01:06:56,100 --> 01:07:00,820
If you didn’t get those kisses, you would’ve lost twice already!

1970
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:08,780
First

1971
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:08,780
Miyasako

1972
01:07:01,470 --> 01:07:08,780
Azuma Mikihisa

1973

Okay let's get started

1980
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:13,620
The topic is Hamada Masatoshi

1981
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:16,690
Hamada Masatoshi

1982
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:16,690
Praise Target

1983
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:15,900
Praise timer start!

1984
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:19,960
He’s a very good comedian

1985
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:22,090
He’s very kind

1986
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:24,210
He’s very cheerful

1987
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:27,130
I have a good physique

1988
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:27,880
I didn't know that

1989
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,530
No way!!

1990
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:29,780
Nope!

1991
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,540
Do you really have a good physique?

1992
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:35,710
Why the hell are you all ganging up on me!?

1993
01:07:36,910 --> 01:07:37,640
Which part is good?

1994
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,140
It’s not always about the looks, isn’t it?

1995
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:41,810
It’s about posture, right?

1996
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:45,650
He’s short and stout!

1997
01:07:45,650 --> 01:07:48,000
He’s the shortest and stoutest!

1998
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,990
Let’s go with something else

1999
01:07:52,290 --> 01:07:54,390
They did the same thing too anyway!

2000
01:07:54,590 --> 01:07:56,860
Like them we’ll just do it again

2001
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:57,510
Come on, Downtown...

2002
01:07:56,860 --> 01:08:00,500
He’s very kind

2003
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:03,070
I’m very handsome

2004
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:02,520
Aw come onnnn

2005
01:08:04,550 --> 01:08:05,470
No wayyy

2006
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:07,970
I can’t compliment myself?

2007
01:08:07,970 --> 01:08:11,240
Hamada-san, you’re not that handsome

2008
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:13,110
You’re pretty ugly!

2009
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:12,940
I can say that about myself, can't I?

2010
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:14,110
Ebisu, why don't you tell him?

2011
01:08:14,110 --> 01:08:16,780
You’re not that handsome!

2012
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:18,030
Why is that?

2013
01:08:19,050 --> 01:08:21,150
Those were some harsh words!

2014
01:08:21,150 --> 01:08:25,920
Frankly speaking, you're just okay looking

2015
01:08:24,570 --> 01:08:25,920
He's not even "okay"

2016
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:28,190
Okay, let’s get to it!

2017
01:08:28,190 --> 01:08:30,810
You’re too lenient, Junior!

2018
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:31,010
No way he's handsome...

2019
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:33,600
I’m very handsome

2020
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,800
He’s good at golf

2021
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,850
He’s dignified

2022
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:40,100
He’s a strong drinker

2023
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:42,670
He’s a good actor

2024
01:08:42,670 --> 01:08:44,790
I'm a devoted husband

2025
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:50,980
That's an OUT

2026
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:52,480
OUT!

2027
01:08:51,730 --> 01:08:54,050
That was the worst OUT this year

2028
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:57,450
Can't I compliment myself!?

2029
01:08:55,770 --> 01:08:57,450
Worst OUT this year

2030
01:08:57,450 --> 01:08:58,170
Worst OUT

2031
01:08:58,170 --> 01:08:59,370
Worst OUT this year

2032
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:03,860
The general consensus is you're OUT

2033
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:03,860
Couldn't back you up on that one

2034
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:06,300
If I didn’t say it, then who would?!

2035
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:08,800
I knew you guys wouldn’t say that about me!

2036
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:16,270
Fujimon

2037
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:16,270
Second

2038
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:16,270
Ebisu Yoshikazu

2039
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:16,270
Fujimoto Toshifumi

2040
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:16,270
Hakata Daikichi

2041
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:16,270
Matsumoto Hitoshi

2042
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:16,270
Tsukitei Housei

2043
01:09:09,430 --> 01:09:11,050
Next up is Team Fujimon

2044
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:14,420
Can they break Team Miyasako’s record 8 rounds?

2045
01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:19,680
The topic is Ebisu Yoshikazu

2046
01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:22,450
Ebisu Yoshikazu

2047
01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:22,450
Praise target

2048
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:27,020
He writes interesting manga

2049
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:29,950
He often takes the bus

2050
01:09:30,690 --> 01:09:32,260
Wrong

2051
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:36,130
That was shit!!

2052
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:37,340
That was quick...

2053
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:40,530
It was just so sudden

2054
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:41,730
That totally sucked

2055
01:09:40,530 --> 01:09:41,530
Too sudden

2056
01:09:41,530 --> 01:09:46,340
After the claps, you get no time whatsoever!

2057
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:46,340
I don't like it

2058
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:47,720
That's for everyone

2059
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:48,870
That's how it is!!

2060
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:51,240
Taking the bus is fine, isn’t it?

2061
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:51,240
Taking the bus

2062
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:54,710
He often takes the bus for work, right?

2063
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:54,710
That's right, for work!

2064
01:09:55,980 --> 01:09:58,280
Okay we accept "He often takes the bus"

2065
01:09:58,280 --> 01:09:59,380
Keeping up the rhythm

2066
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:01,750
He often takes the bus

2067
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:03,790
He’s into boat racing

2068
01:10:03,790 --> 01:10:10,160
He’s kind to others

2069
01:10:07,990 --> 01:10:09,180
You're just clapping

2070
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:12,730
He can't even do it

2071
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:12,730
No good.

2072
01:10:10,610 --> 01:10:12,730
That's an OUT

2073
01:10:12,730 --> 01:10:16,370
You couldn't even follow the rhythm, so please stop

2074
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:16,120
You must have something good to praise yourself with

2075
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:21,970
It was over when Nakai came.

2076
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:24,640
"Ye-s" Nakai in the house.

2077
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,540
Yep, good job. Let's start from your part.

2078
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:27,660
Let's go.

2079
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:29,780
No matter what curry he eats-

2080
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:30,150
Too early.

2081
01:10:30,150 --> 01:10:30,450
Early.

2082
01:10:30,450 --> 01:10:32,580
Early.

2083
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:33,380
Early.

2084
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:34,550
OUT! It's OUT!

2085
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:35,350
OUT! It's OUT!

2086
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:36,350
Let's go!

2087
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:38,960
No matter what curry-

2088
01:10:38,990 --> 01:10:40,090
Make it match!

2089
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:42,090
After the thump thump.

2090
01:10:42,090 --> 01:10:43,360
If you can't even do it now, you will fail with anyone.

2091
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,960
If you can't even do it now, you will fail with anyone.

2092
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:47,430
No matter who the theme is about, you will fail.

2093
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:49,400
No matter who the theme is about, you will fail.

2094
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:51,900
He can't even get the rhythm.

2095
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:52,900
Lets go

2096
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:59,440
Curry is delicious anywhere.

2097
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,980
You are just praising curry.

2098
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:09,870
Team Miyasako is in the lead.

2099
01:11:09,870 --> 01:11:13,970
An unexpected turnout with Downtown after this.

2100
01:11:45,170 --> 01:11:47,640
If you win, you are OUT Rock-Paper-Scissors.

2101
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,160
The loser continues.

2102
01:11:49,310 --> 01:11:52,780
If you win, you are OUT! If you lose, you continue!!

2103
01:11:53,830 --> 01:11:55,900
To become a top-notch scientist,

2104
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:58,400
reacting fast is essential.

2105
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:59,920
Sounds hard.
Sure does.

2106
01:11:58,750 --> 01:12:03,710
Let's test your reaction time

2107
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:03,710
with a game challenge.

2108
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:06,210
The rules are simple.

2109
01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:09,230
Play Rock-Paper-Scissors to this rhythm.

2110
01:12:09,230 --> 01:12:13,930
You win by losing more times than your opponent.

2111
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:17,920
First are the captains Miyasako vs. Fujimoto.

2112
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:21,640
Miyasako has to continue losing first.

2113
01:12:22,190 --> 01:12:24,190
Okay, Miyasako, are you up for it?

2114
01:12:24,190 --> 01:12:27,060
My reflexes are so amazing.

2115
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:26,100
Do your best.

2116
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:26,730
I see.

2117
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:29,600
So I will win easily.

2118
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,530
How do you respond, Fujimon?

2119
01:12:30,530 --> 01:12:33,440
My head is also fast so

2120
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:35,270
I won't lose.

2121
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:36,440
Do your best

2122
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,790
Let's get it on, Miyasako

2123
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:40,790
Rock-Paper-Scissors

2124
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:42,580
where the loser continues

2125
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:43,180
START

2126
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:04,050
Wait!

2127
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:04,850
No, no, no, no.

2128
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:07,140
He sucks.

2129
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:07,720
That's too early in the round.

2130
01:13:05,970 --> 01:13:07,720
I want to puke.

2131
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:10,070
Did you see that? His arms went crazy,

2132
01:13:10,270 --> 01:13:10,720
and then suddenly his fingers went limp.

2133
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,290
and then suddenly his fingers went limp.

2134
01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:13,280
Scary

2135
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:13,790
Scary

2136
01:13:13,810 --> 01:13:14,810
Scary

2137
01:13:15,310 --> 01:13:18,830
When your part comes up,

2138
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:18,830
I will roast all of you!!

2139
01:13:18,830 --> 01:13:20,120
It's so freaking difficult.

2140
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:21,700
Now Fujimon will be

2141
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:23,740
the one who has to lose.

2142
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:27,660
Next person to lose Fujimoto Toshifumi

2143
01:13:23,740 --> 01:13:25,370
I just have to keep losing, right?

2144
01:13:25,270 --> 01:13:25,620
Take it away.

2145
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:26,590
I can easily do this.

2146
01:13:26,590 --> 01:13:29,590
Easy stuff.

2147
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:30,160
Start!

2148
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:06,060
You are on fire.

2149
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:16,160
The winner is

2150
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,020
Fujimon.

2151
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:21,960
That's our leader.

2152
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:22,210
De-ci-si-ve win

2153
01:14:22,210 --> 01:14:22,510
De-ci-si-ve win

2154
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:22,780
De-ci-si-ve win

2155
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:24,480
De-ci-si-ve win

2156
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,480
Decisive win!!

2157
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:27,250
If you do it wrong I will tear you apart!!

2158
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:29,390
If you do it wrong I will tear you apart!!

2159
01:14:29,390 --> 01:14:30,640
Decisive win for us!!

2160
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:34,690
Second battle: Cunning Takeyama VS. Hakata Daikichi.

2161
01:14:34,690 --> 01:14:36,710
Takeyama has to lose.

2162
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:38,710
So

2163
01:14:38,710 --> 01:14:39,430
Just look at him

2164
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:41,180
He's just digusting
The one in blue is disgusting.

2165
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:42,630
I will definitely win.

2166
01:14:42,630 --> 01:14:43,770
I am confident.

2167
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:45,100
Even his voice is dirty.

2168
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:46,600
My voice has nothing to do with it.

2169
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:49,840
I only have to do  Rock-Paper-Scissors.

2170
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:50,910
Part of that dodgy agency!

2171
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:52,940
No, we are not!!

2172
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:53,840
We're not dodgy in the slightest!

2173
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,150
Part of that dodgy agency!!

2174
01:14:54,810 --> 01:14:55,760
No, we are not!!

2175
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:57,310
How are you feeling?

2176
01:14:57,110 --> 01:14:58,430
As if I'm going to lose to someone who loses his voice on such a big job.

2177
01:14:58,430 --> 01:15:01,500
As if I'm going to lose to someone who loses his voice on such a big job.

2178
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:04,050
Let's get ready.

2179
01:15:04,050 --> 01:15:05,860
Continue-if-you-lose START

2180
01:15:14,130 --> 01:15:16,280
Put it out faster.

2181
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:20,500
Wait a minute

2182
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:23,670
The distance it's...

2183
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:24,690
The distance

2184
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:26,940
I want you much closer for the camera.

2185
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:28,860
Even more.
Stick it out!

2186
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:30,360
Closer.

2187
01:15:30,910 --> 01:15:33,250
Get closer.

2188
01:15:34,550 --> 01:15:36,820
All or nothing.

2189
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,620
Rock-Paper-Scissors START

2190
01:16:09,370 --> 01:16:11,770
You are famous for comedic outbursts, right?

2191
01:16:11,770 --> 01:16:12,620
Why did you slip up?

2192
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:14,120
Why did you slip up?

2193
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:16,460
Couldn't do it.

2194
01:16:16,410 --> 01:16:18,410
Let's rotate.

2195
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:22,480
Daikichi, your turn.

2196
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,500
Loser-continues START

2197
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:10,780
Enough already!

2198
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:18,770
Hakata Daikichi

2199
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:20,520
Decisive winner.

2200
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:23,390
It's a decisive winner.

2201
01:17:23,290 --> 01:17:25,810
This person is a decisive winner.

2202
01:17:25,810 --> 01:17:27,830
World champion.

2203
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:30,320
This was the world championship.

2204
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:32,000
Just relax and then you can do it.

2205
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:33,670
Last one: Downtown battle.

2206
01:17:33,670 --> 01:17:36,670
Last one: Downtown battle.

2207
01:17:40,230 --> 01:17:45,280
Last Battle: 53 year old middle-aged Downtown's throwdown.

2208
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,280
Starting with Matsumoto.

2209
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:49,320
Hey wait, it's shameful for me to do it with this guy.

2210
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:53,390
Hey wait, it's shameful for me to do it with this guy.

2211
01:17:53,390 --> 01:17:54,220
Bring me someone with youthful energy.

2212
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:57,030
Bring me someone with youthful energy.

2213
01:17:57,030 --> 01:17:58,360
It's a battle between two who suck equally.

2214
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:01,330
It's a battle between two who suck equally.

2215
01:18:01,330 --> 01:18:03,670
That's low!!

2216
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:06,850
Let's continue with Rock-Paper-Scissors.

2217
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:08,520
START!

2218
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:22,400
Weak!!

2219
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:25,420
Weak!!

2220
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:28,790
It's okay.
Weren't ready.

2221
01:18:31,910 --> 01:18:34,500
You weren't ready, right?

2222
01:18:35,230 --> 01:18:36,670
Junior is too fast.

2223
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:40,100
Stop making it about preparation, please.

2224
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:41,670
This is a match.

2225
01:18:41,670 --> 01:18:43,340
Simply put out your hand.

2226
01:18:44,990 --> 01:18:45,940
Wait everyone, let's take a picture.

2227
01:18:45,940 --> 01:18:48,610
Wait everyone, let's take a picture.

2228
01:18:48,610 --> 01:18:51,080
I refuse.

2229
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:52,180
One more time.

2230
01:18:52,430 --> 01:18:55,500
I just didn't get it last time.

2231
01:18:55,950 --> 01:18:58,970
It's the freaking first time I've ever done this!!

2232
01:18:58,970 --> 01:19:00,820
It's the freaking first time for me, you idiots!!

2233
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:03,690
That's true for all of us.

2234
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:07,230
You should only be angry at the blue team!

2235
01:19:06,710 --> 01:19:08,130
START!

2236
01:19:19,810 --> 01:19:23,380
This is terrible.

2237
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:25,830
What the hell is this!!

2238
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:28,800
You're the leader!!

2239
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,150
No, it's just that...

2240
01:19:30,150 --> 01:19:31,420
Aren't you the leader?

2241
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:32,920
It's just that I really wanted to win.

2242
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:36,760
It's just that I really wanted to win.

2243
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:37,490
You so confidently stuck out a paper

2244
01:19:37,490 --> 01:19:38,910
You so confidently stuck out a paper

2245
01:19:38,910 --> 01:19:40,830
When your partner put out rock.

2246
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:43,930
Because I've never done this!!

2247
01:19:43,930 --> 01:19:45,100
Winning by putting it out later. What the hell...

2248
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:47,700
Winning by putting it out later. What the hell...

2249
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:48,470
Let's reverse the roles next time.

2250
01:19:48,470 --> 01:19:49,570
Let's reverse the roles next time.

2251
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:51,740
Okay so...

2252
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:52,590
Ah, okay.

2253
01:19:52,590 --> 01:19:54,810
Next person who has to lose: Hamada Masatoshi

2254
01:19:54,810 --> 01:19:56,180
I just have to lose, right?

2255
01:19:56,180 --> 01:19:57,600
Hamada

2256
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,600
Lose-to-win Rock-Paper-Scissors

2257
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,600
The loser continues

2258
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:02,500
START!

2259
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:09,960
Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lose!

2260
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:16,170
His timing is completely off!

2261
01:20:16,170 --> 01:20:18,450
It's just Downtown!!

2262
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:21,970
They're the worst!!

2263
01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:24,390
Just trash!!

2264
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:28,260
They just played it like normal.

2265
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:30,600
This is messed up.

2266
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:32,080
Damn it!

2267
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:33,300
Alright, one more time!

2268
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:35,800
This is really hard though

2269
01:20:36,270 --> 01:20:37,870
Please keep your cool!

2270
01:20:37,990 --> 01:20:40,610
I don't really get it

2271
01:20:40,990 --> 01:20:43,360
They're pretty bad

2272
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:45,010
Ready - start!

2273
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:52,300
Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lose!

2274
01:20:55,270 --> 01:20:56,610
I told you!!

2275
01:20:56,610 --> 01:20:59,040
What the hell are you doing, Hamada?!

2276
01:20:59,910 --> 01:21:00,110
I WON

2277
01:21:00,110 --> 01:21:00,310
I WON

2278
01:21:00,310 --> 01:21:00,510
I WON

2279
01:21:00,510 --> 01:21:01,510
I WON

2280
01:21:03,010 --> 01:21:04,710
Yes it's my win!

2281
01:21:04,710 --> 01:21:05,580
One loser and

2282
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:07,750
One loser and another loser!

2283
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,350
I won, didn't I?

2284
01:21:10,350 --> 01:21:13,140
My turn went really good, didn't it?

2285
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:16,330
You were just as bad!!

2286
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:17,830
Both of you - OUT!!

2287
01:21:18,090 --> 01:21:21,630
Matsumoto did it right several times though

2288
01:21:22,030 --> 01:21:23,130
No he didn't.

2289
01:21:23,430 --> 01:21:25,950
An idiot with another idiot!

2290
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:27,170
And with that,

2291
01:21:27,170 --> 01:21:32,140
the recreational scientist team battle ends with both teams losing

2292
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:37,580
Slowly getting colder out here.

2293
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:37,010
We're a bit sweaty too.

2294
01:21:37,610 --> 01:21:38,980
~Jan~Ken~Pon~Pon

2295
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:41,950
Daikichi was pretty amazing

2296
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:45,420
It's all about if you can get the hang of the game...

2297
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:52,810
Whoa- It's a kid!

2298
01:21:52,810 --> 01:21:54,100
Whoa- It's a kid!

2299
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:58,900
Both of them in Adidas tracksuits...

2300
01:22:01,770 --> 01:22:04,540
I'm taking him to the hospital!

2301
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:06,040
He's got a MAJOR FEVER!!

2302
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:10,350
Taking the boy for check-ups

2303
01:22:07,230 --> 01:22:08,610
He's so annoying.

2304
01:22:10,350 --> 01:22:13,120
How are you feeling?

2305
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:18,170
I've got the chills...

2306
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:22,990
Looks like he just came back from the store

2307
01:22:22,990 --> 01:22:24,630
Squeak~

2308
01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:28,230
Make the kid change his voice a bit...

2309
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:28,280
Exactly.

2310
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:30,800
"I've got the chills"...

2311
01:22:32,970 --> 01:22:37,840
He's pretty obsessed with fevers, isn't he?

2312
01:22:39,090 --> 01:22:41,260
12:30 PM

2313
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:46,080
Despite returning to the lab, they keep thinking about that rhythm...

2314
01:22:47,450 --> 01:22:49,900
Rock-Paper-Scissors, lose!

2315
01:22:51,820 --> 01:22:54,260
Hey, Hamada?

2316
01:22:54,290 --> 01:22:55,090
When he said Rock-paper-scissors lose,

2317
01:22:55,090 --> 01:22:55,590
When he said Rock-paper-scissors lose,

2318
01:22:55,590 --> 01:22:56,190
When he said Rock-paper-scissors lose,

2319
01:22:56,190 --> 01:22:59,460
You kinda smiled a little there!!

2320
01:22:57,210 --> 01:22:58,410
No I didn't!

2321
01:22:59,930 --> 01:23:02,280
Alright, ring him out in 3 - 2 - 1

2322
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:04,400
Go! Ba-baaaan.

2323
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:08,470
Yeah, this is a no-laughing game, so.

2324
01:23:08,770 --> 01:23:09,810
I did NOT laugh! What's up with you guys?

2325
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:11,370
I did NOT laugh! What's up with you guys?

2326
01:23:11,370 --> 01:23:13,780
Those are the rules after all.

2327
01:23:15,010 --> 01:23:20,950
We're getting better at hiding it though.

2328
01:23:17,210 --> 01:23:20,950
Sometimes they can't tell if we laughed or not

2329
01:23:21,150 --> 01:23:22,150
How about you two try it?

2330
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:23,350
How about you two try it?

2331
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,020
Give it a shot. That game.

2332
01:23:25,020 --> 01:23:26,320
Give it a shot. That game.

2333
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:27,920
Let's do it, Tanaka?

2334
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:31,960
Tanaka has to lose to Hosei after he's thrown.

2335
01:23:29,190 --> 01:23:31,160
Endo, say "Rock-Paper-Scissors lose!" then?

2336
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:33,480
One, two- Rock-paper-Scissors, lose!

2337
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,110
That was amazing.

2338
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:52,480
Now, switch sides?

2339
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:00,760
What? You just won!!

2340
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:02,490
He doesn't even know when he loses...

2341
01:24:02,490 --> 01:24:03,560
He doesn't even know when he loses...

2342
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:05,760
Still, we did it four times straight.

2343
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,830
You wanna try it too?

2344
01:24:07,830 --> 01:24:10,900
Okay, so, you have to lose to-

2345
01:24:09,030 --> 01:24:10,900
Dude, I know.

2346
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,550
Rock-Paper-Scissors, Go!

2347
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:22,310
I HATE THIS, IT KEEPS MAKING ME LAUGH!

2348
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,850
This game isn't fun at all!

2349
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:25,730
Wait, me too?

2350
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:27,650
You laughed big time.

2351
01:24:31,050 --> 01:24:32,570
This game is dangerous.

2352
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:37,490
They hit pretty hard now, right?

2353
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:42,680
How about we play normally, but you have to win the throw?

2354
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:43,530
Basically win after I've already seen your hand?

2355
01:24:43,530 --> 01:24:46,350
Basically win after I've already seen your hand?

2356
01:24:44,450 --> 01:24:45,400
Yeah, just win?

2357
01:24:46,350 --> 01:24:48,300
I wouldn't lose in a thousand years!!

2358
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:48,300
Right, come over here.

2359
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:51,270
He just has to throw the winning hand.

2360
01:24:48,620 --> 01:24:50,620
Okay, Matsumoto and Hosei are playing.

2361
01:24:51,410 --> 01:24:53,240
Rock-Paper-Scissors-Win!

2362
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:54,710
Huh?

2363
01:24:59,330 --> 01:25:01,900
So I just- the fingers-

2364
01:25:07,890 --> 01:25:08,740
Seriously, what.

2365
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:11,160
My ability to focus just disappeared.

2366
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:13,460
My ability to focus just disappeared.

2367
01:25:14,230 --> 01:25:16,730
I guess the timing is hard to get used to?

2368
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:19,600
Could we do it by saying the outcome?

2369
01:25:19,940 --> 01:25:22,070
Saying the outcome?

2370
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:21,400
For example.

2371
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:23,320
Throw after me, right?

2372
01:25:24,270 --> 01:25:25,790
Win!

2373
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:28,710
Ah I get it!

2374
01:25:29,010 --> 01:25:30,610
Lose!

2375
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:33,450
Win!

2376
01:25:33,450 --> 01:25:34,980
Way too slow!!

2377
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:37,420
Could you try it the other way around?

2378
01:25:37,850 --> 01:25:40,620
Let me just concentrate like hell, okay?

2379
01:25:41,890 --> 01:25:43,390
Win!

2380
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:46,560
Lose!

2381
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,410
You're too slow!

2382
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:50,800
Win!

2383
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:55,670
You take so long!!

2384
01:25:57,660 --> 01:25:58,940
You're just so slow!

2385
01:25:58,940 --> 01:26:00,780
Damn slow!

2386
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:03,330
He's like a really old man.

2387
01:26:05,050 --> 01:26:06,850
It's just not a natural movement?

2388
01:26:06,850 --> 01:26:09,920
Give it a shot then, if you're so great.

2389
01:26:08,030 --> 01:26:09,150
Yeah, let's do it.

2390
01:26:09,950 --> 01:26:12,370
It just can't be that hard!

2391
01:26:10,390 --> 01:26:16,290
Hamada accepts the challenge.

2392
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:12,620
You were legendarily slow though!

2393
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:15,790
There's no way you can lose!

2394
01:26:13,610 --> 01:26:16,840
Takes a while to get used to the moves, right?

2395
01:26:19,460 --> 01:26:20,630
Win!

2396
01:26:21,330 --> 01:26:22,480
Win!

2397
01:26:22,830 --> 01:26:24,070
Lose!

2398
01:26:24,070 --> 01:26:25,400
Ah~

2399
01:26:32,740 --> 01:26:34,180
This guy is awful.

2400
01:26:34,180 --> 01:26:35,810
He went Aah~.

2401
01:26:36,510 --> 01:26:38,730
I didn't think you'd say "Lose!"

2402
01:26:40,950 --> 01:26:44,390
Getting it right instantly is pretty hard, eh?

2403
01:26:42,150 --> 01:26:42,900
Yeah!

2404
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:45,620
Seems pretty hard, still funny though.

2405
01:26:45,020 --> 01:26:46,760
But the worst thing by far

2406
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:47,620
"Aahn~"

2407
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:49,390
Saying "Aah~" like he did.

2408
01:26:52,310 --> 01:26:54,360
Ah-ahn~

2409
01:26:55,330 --> 01:26:56,430
Should stop here.

2410
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:00,170
I expected-

2411
01:27:00,450 --> 01:27:04,190
I expected you to say "Win!" and got messed up!

2412
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:08,180
The game got way too complicated there.

2413
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:10,010
I can't get over the Ahn~

2414
01:27:10,010 --> 01:27:13,420
That Ah~

2415
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:13,420
Is seriously unbearable

2416
01:27:13,420 --> 01:27:14,620
Even if a foreigner heard that!

2417
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:15,080
Oh! This guy messed up real bad

2418
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:15,700
Oh! This guy messed up real bad

2419
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:17,420
Oh! This guy messed up real bad

2420
01:27:17,420 --> 01:27:20,590
Just by how he said Ahn~.

2421
01:27:20,590 --> 01:27:20,890
This dude is hopeless

2422
01:27:20,890 --> 01:27:24,030
"This dude is hopeless"

2423
01:27:23,740 --> 01:27:25,860
These guys hit hard too...

2424
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:28,200
Let's try playing "Look away!"

2425
01:27:28,830 --> 01:27:31,230
So like, "Look away-way-way".

2426
01:27:31,630 --> 01:27:34,570
Getting it right three times would be pretty amazing.

2427
01:27:34,570 --> 01:27:38,440
Coming up with a new game on the spot

2428
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:38,420
Three times?

2429
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:41,040
Alright, Look away-way-way!

2430
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:45,730
Couldn't see his finger at all

2431
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:50,950
What the hell even happened just now?

2432
01:27:51,820 --> 01:27:55,220
You got it twice though!

2433
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:54,620
Yeah, not bad!

2434
01:27:57,930 --> 01:28:00,060
Pretty hard game, isn't it.

2435
01:28:00,060 --> 01:28:00,730
How about Look away-away?

2436
01:28:00,730 --> 01:28:02,230
How about Look away-away?

2437
01:28:02,230 --> 01:28:05,250
Turning your head like that is already hard.

2438
01:28:04,180 --> 01:28:05,120
Yeah, true.

2439
01:28:06,150 --> 01:28:07,970
I'll go "one-two, hoi hoi!"

2440
01:28:08,870 --> 01:28:09,990
One-two-

2441
01:28:09,990 --> 01:28:10,940
Hoi-hoi!

2442
01:28:11,690 --> 01:28:12,890
Nice!

2443
01:28:13,810 --> 01:28:15,240
Try doing that three times straight.

2444
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:15,560
Hoi-hoi, hoi-hoi, hoi-hoi.

2445
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:16,110
Hoi-hoi, hoi-hoi, hoi-hoi.

2446
01:28:16,110 --> 01:28:16,410
Hoi-hoi, hoi-hoi, hoi-hoi.

2447
01:28:16,410 --> 01:28:17,010
Hoi-hoi, hoi-hoi, hoi-hoi.

2448
01:28:17,010 --> 01:28:17,380
Hoi-hoi, hoi-hoi, hoi-hoi.

2449
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:18,610
Hoi-hoi, hoi-hoi, hoi-hoi.

2450
01:28:19,970 --> 01:28:21,180
Hoi-hoi!

2451
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:31,180
Probably can't even see his finger.

2452
01:28:31,660 --> 01:28:33,960
You need a sixth sense for this.

2453
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:37,830
Right?

2454
01:28:37,830 --> 01:28:40,140
This was the worst so far!

2455
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:41,440
You gotta go with your instincts.

2456
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:44,140
You gotta go with your instincts.

2457
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:49,010
If you did it 8 times,

2458
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:49,010
and got it wrong every time, now that would be amazing.

2459
01:28:48,010 --> 01:28:49,980
More of a miracle I think.

2460
01:28:49,010 --> 01:28:53,680
Increasing the difficulty by going eight times.

2461
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:53,720
So like, hoihoihoihoihoihoihoihoi

2462
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:56,720
You've gotta miss all of them okay?

2463
01:28:58,770 --> 01:28:59,470
Ready, set-

2464
01:28:59,570 --> 01:29:02,190
Hoi-hoi-hoi-hoi-hoi-hoi-hoi-hoi-hoi

2465
01:29:03,830 --> 01:29:05,660
Obviously we're going to...

2466
01:29:20,780 --> 01:29:23,010
Did anyone even keep score?

2467
01:29:23,260 --> 01:29:23,810
No one even bothered with score!!

2468
01:29:23,810 --> 01:29:26,480
No one even bothered with score!!

2469
01:29:26,930 --> 01:29:29,250
They've been working for 5 hours straight

2470
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:32,470
1 PM

2471
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:32,220
Hamada is still trying to deal with Tanaka's baby-faced weapon.

2472
01:29:33,020 --> 01:29:34,820
Could you put that thing on? And then the thai kick?

2473
01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:37,630
Could you put that thing on? And then the thai kick?

2474
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:40,560
Eh-wait, what do you mean?

2475
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:41,730
"Put that on and then the kick"

What do you mean by that?

2476
01:29:41,730 --> 01:29:43,030
"Put that on and then the kick"

What do you mean by that?

2477
01:29:43,030 --> 01:29:47,370
Well, without it you can see the kick and prepare for it.
Put it on and you won't see it coming.

2478
01:29:49,470 --> 01:29:51,540
How y'all doing?

2479
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:52,940
Here at our famous Gaa-Suu laboratories,

2480
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:55,110
Here at our famous Gaa-Suu laboratories,

2481
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:55,110
we focus on

2482
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:57,710
passing down the secrets of training your body

}strengthening team spirit

2483
01:29:57,710 --> 01:29:58,880
passing down the secrets of training your body

}strengthening team spirit

2484
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:01,350
passing down the secrets of training your body

strengthening team spirit

2485
01:30:01,350 --> 01:30:03,920
Let's go and do some special training.

2486
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:05,920
Prepare yourselves.

2487
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:12,760
Training the body and mind:
The scientists' secret training begins

2488
01:30:13,330 --> 01:30:15,300
Let's get on the bus and move out.

2489
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:23,920
They get on the bus and head to the training center

2490
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:18,480
They get on the bus and head to the training center

2491
01:30:16,930 --> 01:30:23,920
What awaits them at their destination!?

2492
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:20,200
They get on the bus and head to the training center

2493
01:30:27,810 --> 01:30:33,800
The curtain rises on a new battle for the 5 of them

2494
01:30:28,810 --> 01:30:32,500
The curtain rises on a new battle for the 5 of them

2495
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:40,310
Science Laboratory: 5 hours since they started work

2496
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:39,740
It is now 1pm. The bus heads for the special training center.

2497
01:30:41,260 --> 01:30:42,310
However, during this time,

2498
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:45,580
assassins of laughter are, of course, waiting for them!

2499
01:30:45,810 --> 01:30:46,810
Ah~ it stopped

2500
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:49,810
Bus stop reached

2501
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:50,930
The bus stopped at a strange place

2502
01:30:50,770 --> 01:30:51,170
Yeah

2503
01:30:51,050 --> 01:30:52,220
Yeah, really...

2504
01:30:53,030 --> 01:30:55,200
there's a lot of the general population doing laundry

2505
01:30:56,920 --> 01:31:03,230
Client

2506
01:30:56,920 --> 01:31:03,230
Detective's daughter

2507
01:30:56,920 --> 01:31:03,230
Kotooge Eiji

2508
01:30:56,920 --> 01:31:03,230
Sumida Moeno

2509
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:02,840
Young miss... um...

2510
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:04,110
Sorry about today

2511
01:31:04,350 --> 01:31:06,400
So, what's your request?

2512
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:06,400
Well...

2513
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:07,070
My younger brother  went missing

2514
01:31:07,070 --> 01:31:08,620
My younger brother went missing

2515
01:31:08,650 --> 01:31:10,540
from his room... there were

2516
01:31:10,540 --> 01:31:10,940
various unknown thugs... things

2517
01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:11,270
various unknown thugs...things

2518
01:31:11,270 --> 01:31:12,590
various unknown thugs...things

2519
01:31:12,620 --> 01:31:13,910
found

2520
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:16,410
Therefore... um that is...

2521
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:18,980
until now, that special power

2522
01:31:19,010 --> 01:31:21,760
um... just by the object. erm... just by looking

2523
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:24,580
the emotions be read

2524
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:26,150
I don't understand

2525
01:31:26,150 --> 01:31:27,790
I don't understand at all

2526
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:29,790
Kotooge, please

2527
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:35,660
We let you off a good couple of times there...

2528
01:31:35,660 --> 01:31:42,470
Request to the detective

2529
01:31:35,660 --> 01:31:42,470
Search for missing younger brother

2530
01:31:40,030 --> 01:31:41,400
We're out?

2531
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,670
Are we out for this?

2532
01:31:46,090 --> 01:31:47,340
Anyway

2533
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:48,520
From my younger brother's room, unknown thingswere found

2534
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:50,340
From my younger brother's room, unknown things were found

2535
01:31:50,340 --> 01:31:51,580
From those things, I heard emotions left in them can be read by

2536
01:31:51,580 --> 01:31:53,180
From those things, I heard emotions left in them can be read by

2537
01:31:53,190 --> 01:31:54,750
the owner of that special power,

2538
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:56,750
your papa, the visual detective

2539
01:31:56,830 --> 01:32:00,120
culprit's...

2540
01:31:58,850 --> 01:32:00,120
ba...

2541
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:03,470
culprit's... um...

2542
01:32:03,490 --> 01:32:06,460
I want him to see the culprit's backbone...

2543
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:11,130
Kotooge, who has completely forgotten his lines

2544
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:08,280
What the hell?

2545
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:10,400
No, I should have been safe

2546
01:32:12,050 --> 01:32:13,150
I'm sure he doesn't want to see something like a backbone

2547
01:32:14,150 --> 01:32:24,840
Detective's special power

2548
01:32:14,150 --> 01:32:24,840
To read the profile of the culprit from the objects left behind in the room

2549
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:17,550
Irritating

2550
01:32:19,990 --> 01:32:21,340
What does he mean by "backbone"?

2551
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:23,070
That definitely isn't in the script

2552
01:32:23,070 --> 01:32:25,080
He definitely changed his line

2553
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:27,050
He changed it to a line which is easier to say

2554
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:29,180
He made it his own

2555
01:32:29,930 --> 01:32:30,930
I wish for him to search for clues of the culprit

2556
01:32:30,930 --> 01:32:32,850
I wish for him to search for clues of the culprit

2557
01:32:32,850 --> 01:32:33,590
So that's it, I understand

2558
01:32:33,590 --> 01:32:34,450
So that's it, I understand

2559
01:32:34,450 --> 01:32:36,450
Papa!!

2560
01:32:37,670 --> 01:32:39,090
What's the matter? Tei?

2561
01:32:37,670 --> 01:32:47,080
T/N: Sumida Moeno and Matsuzaka Toori are playing characters Tei and Tabito from new drama "Visual Detective Higurashi Tabito"

2562
01:32:39,090 --> 01:32:40,120
Well, this person came to us about his younger brother

2563
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:41,360
Well, this person came to us about his younger brother

2564
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:43,660
He wants you to help him search

2565
01:32:43,810 --> 01:32:44,130
I see. Hello.

2566
01:32:44,130 --> 01:32:45,130
I am Higurashi Tabito

2567
01:32:44,150 --> 01:32:48,600
Matsuzaka Toori

2568
01:32:44,150 --> 01:32:48,600
Visual detective Higurashi

2569
01:32:45,130 --> 01:32:46,950
If you have any trouble, I can help you

2570
01:32:47,220 --> 01:32:48,220
Thank you

2571
01:32:50,670 --> 01:32:52,000
First, we have this

2572
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,740
First, we have this

2573
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:54,960
I wonder if this belongs to the culprit

2574
01:32:55,270 --> 01:32:58,110
Let me take a look at it.

2575
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:01,710
This is suffering

2576
01:33:01,710 --> 01:33:03,250
This is suffering

2577
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:04,820
From this cushion, I can see suffering

2578
01:33:04,820 --> 01:33:07,150
From this cushion, I can see suffering

2579
01:33:07,150 --> 01:33:08,550
What do you mean by that?

2580
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:09,390
I know!! This must be from

2581
01:33:09,390 --> 01:33:10,320
I know!! This must be from

2582
01:33:10,370 --> 01:33:13,220
a sufferer of super big hemorrhoids for the past 30 years...

2583
01:33:13,270 --> 01:33:14,940
a big-shot straight-man comedian who

2584
01:33:14,940 --> 01:33:17,860
treasures this cushion

2585
01:33:16,530 --> 01:33:17,860
more than his life!!

2586
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:19,600
To treasure a cushion more than life...

2587
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:20,870
Are you Yamada Takao!?

2588
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:23,870
T/N: Yamada Takao is a Japanese entertainer who used to have a role carrying cushions to the participants of variety show "Shoten" in the 80s

2589
01:33:20,870 --> 01:33:22,370
This person is suspicious!!

2590
01:33:22,380 --> 01:33:23,600
This man is certainly

2591
01:33:23,890 --> 01:33:26,540
like a mountain gorilla on the brink of extinction

2592
01:33:26,550 --> 01:33:29,410
However, from this cushion,

2593
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:29,410
I cannot sense any kidnapping intentions or

2594
01:33:29,410 --> 01:33:31,340
any ill will at all

2595
01:33:31,340 --> 01:33:32,040
Is that so?

2596
01:33:38,730 --> 01:33:39,270
Man...

2597
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:42,290
What is he saying in such a matter-of-fact way?

2598
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:42,290
True

2599
01:33:45,790 --> 01:33:47,790
You can go further

2600
01:33:50,430 --> 01:33:52,230
Next, these socks

2601
01:33:52,230 --> 01:33:55,330
Next, these socks

2602
01:33:55,330 --> 01:33:58,600
Does this belong to the culprit?

2603
01:33:57,190 --> 01:33:58,620
Let me take a look

2604
01:34:00,610 --> 01:34:03,170
He's laughing, isn't he?

2605
01:34:02,020 --> 01:34:03,410
This is...

2606
01:34:04,590 --> 01:34:06,210
greed

2607
01:34:06,210 --> 01:34:07,980
From these socks, I can see the ugly human greed

2608
01:34:07,980 --> 01:34:09,910
From these socks, I can see the ugly human greed

2609
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:12,780
What do you mean?

2610
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:14,590
I know!! These socks are surely

2611
01:34:14,590 --> 01:34:15,940
I know!! These socks are surely

2612
01:34:15,950 --> 01:34:17,990
from a comedian who became a rakugo-ka,

2613
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:19,860
a completely mediocre man who

2614
01:34:20,110 --> 01:34:23,730
made in secrecy from his agency, these

2615
01:34:22,330 --> 01:34:23,730
blackmarket goods!!

2616
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:25,730
I've heard that among rakugo-ka,

2617
01:34:25,730 --> 01:34:26,600
I've heard that among rakugo-ka,

2618
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:27,800
they would give goods like these to their favourite fans

2619
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:29,020
they would give goods like these to their favourite fans

2620
01:34:29,050 --> 01:34:29,970
Could it be that this guy

2621
01:34:29,970 --> 01:34:31,100
is trying to earn money on the side with these goods after his rakugo performances?

2622
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:33,200
is trying to earn money on the side with these goods after his rakugo performances?

2623
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:33,740
Does Yoshimoto know about this?

2624
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:37,610
T/N: Yoshimoto is the talent agency Hosei belongs to

2625
01:34:33,740 --> 01:34:35,840
Does Yoshimoto know about this?

2626
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:37,610
This person is suspicious!!

2627
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:39,380
Certainly, it seems this man

2628
01:34:39,390 --> 01:34:41,880
put more effort into making these goods than rakugo,

2629
01:34:41,910 --> 01:34:43,280
a filthy corrupted man.

2630
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:46,350
However, from these socks, I do not see any ill intentions...

2631
01:34:46,350 --> 01:34:47,950
I think this is spiteful

2632
01:34:47,420 --> 01:34:48,120
Terrible

2633
01:34:52,370 --> 01:34:53,390
That's true but

2634
01:34:52,910 --> 01:34:54,390
It's the first time I've seen those

2635
01:34:54,660 --> 01:34:55,930
It's the first time I've seen those too

2636
01:34:55,110 --> 01:34:56,260
What did you make?

2637
01:34:56,290 --> 01:34:57,100
What is that? Sickening!!

2638
01:34:57,100 --> 01:34:58,300
What is that? Sickening!!

2639
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:01,020
True

2640
01:35:01,020 --> 01:35:02,220
Disgusting!

2641
01:35:02,230 --> 01:35:03,130
Don't say anymore

2642
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:04,890
You want more money?

2643
01:35:05,570 --> 01:35:06,170
Just how much did it cost?

2644
01:35:06,170 --> 01:35:08,860
Just how much did it cost?

2645
01:35:08,870 --> 01:35:10,840
I just thought the guests would be happy

2646
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:11,840
Next is this cup...

2647
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:12,930
Next is this cup...

2648
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:14,080
Next is this cup...

2649
01:35:14,980 --> 01:35:15,700
Does this belong to the culprit?

2650
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:17,150
Does this belong to the culprit?

2651
01:35:17,220 --> 01:35:19,880
Let me have a look at it

2652
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:24,390
From this cup,

2653
01:35:24,620 --> 01:35:26,340
I can see a perverted heart that wants to be popular with women

2654
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:29,130
I can see a perverted heart that wants to be popular with women

2655
01:35:29,130 --> 01:35:30,860
What do you mean?

2656
01:35:30,860 --> 01:35:31,900
I know!!This definitely

2657
01:35:31,900 --> 01:35:32,830
I know!! This definitely

2658
01:35:32,850 --> 01:35:36,100
belongs to someone who can only make people laugh using body impressions,

2659
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:38,740
T/N: RIZAP is a famous gym in Japan

2660
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:38,740
just because he wanted to be popular with women,

2661
01:35:37,300 --> 01:35:38,740
he went to RIZAP gym...

2662
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:41,210
It's the cup of an

2663
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:41,210
untalented comedian!!

2664
01:35:41,220 --> 01:35:43,810
A lot got said about me

2665
01:35:43,810 --> 01:35:45,930
He doesn't have many impressions

2666
01:35:43,810 --> 01:35:45,930
I'm super hurt,

2667
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:46,960
super...

2668
01:35:46,910 --> 01:35:47,380
Really.

2669
01:35:47,510 --> 01:35:48,550
Did he really want to become an impressionist comedian?

2670
01:35:48,550 --> 01:35:49,500
Did he really want to become an impressionist comedian?

2671
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:51,050
This person is suspicious!!

2672
01:35:51,070 --> 01:35:52,550
Certainly, this man

2673
01:35:52,570 --> 01:35:55,150
does seem to be of around the same intelligence as an armadillo.

2674
01:35:55,170 --> 01:35:57,690
However, from this cup, I can see no ill intentions

2675
01:35:56,620 --> 01:35:58,340
Same as an armadillo?

2676
01:35:58,220 --> 01:36:00,060
He sure said some things about me very firmly...

2677
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:00,960
He sure said some things about me very firmly.

2678
01:36:01,990 --> 01:36:03,680
But armadillo's great

2679
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:04,560
Endo's an armadillo...

2680
01:36:04,930 --> 01:36:05,850
Around the same?

2681
01:36:05,860 --> 01:36:08,070
Didn't he say "below that"?

2682
01:36:07,370 --> 01:36:08,070
Be gentle!

2683
01:36:08,930 --> 01:36:10,200
I said be gentle!

2684
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:16,140
How scary

2685
01:36:17,580 --> 01:36:19,310
Next...

2686
01:36:20,330 --> 01:36:21,950
This picture...

2687
01:36:24,930 --> 01:36:28,890
does this belong to the culprit?

2688
01:36:28,900 --> 01:36:30,560
What's wrong?

2689
01:36:29,940 --> 01:36:31,940
Let me take a look

2690
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:35,430
That's...

2691
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:37,430
From this picture, I can see two emotions

2692
01:36:37,430 --> 01:36:39,730
From this picture, I can see two emotions

2693
01:36:40,130 --> 01:36:41,630
First one is boredom. The other one is...

2694
01:36:41,630 --> 01:36:43,370
First one is boredom. The other one is...

2695
01:36:43,370 --> 01:36:45,370
First one is boredom. The other one is...

2696
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:46,090
Excuse me;

2697
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:47,070
may I become serious and use my power?

2698
01:36:47,070 --> 01:36:49,640
may I become serious and use my power?

2699
01:36:51,310 --> 01:36:53,310
it's here

2700
01:36:54,910 --> 01:36:55,600
it's here

2701
01:36:57,180 --> 01:36:58,250
I've got it!! The second one is happiness.

2702
01:36:58,250 --> 01:36:59,320
I've got it!! The second one ishappiness.

2703
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:00,950
I've got it!! The second one is happiness.

2704
01:37:00,950 --> 01:37:01,820
Boredom and happiness?

2705
01:37:01,820 --> 01:37:03,590
Boredom and happiness?

2706
01:37:03,590 --> 01:37:05,290
What do you mean?

2707
01:37:05,310 --> 01:37:06,120
I know!! This must be from

2708
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:06,990
I know!! This must be from

2709
01:37:07,020 --> 01:37:08,760
when a certain dark-skinned macho comedian

2710
01:37:08,790 --> 01:37:10,090
sang for his daughter at karaoke,

2711
01:37:10,130 --> 01:37:12,260
the song from Triton of the Sea,

2712
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:15,770
but it was so boring, she fell asleep.

2713
01:37:15,780 --> 01:37:17,570
She felt bad so

2714
01:37:17,590 --> 01:37:20,300
she drew this for her macho dad:

2715
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:23,370
this Triton of the Sea!!

2716
01:37:23,370 --> 01:37:24,110
That's definitely a twisted form of love

2717
01:37:23,370 --> 01:37:26,740
T/N: "Triton of the Sea" was a manga by Tezuka Osamu in 1969 to 1971. There was an anime made, which aired in 1972

2718
01:37:24,110 --> 01:37:25,240
That's definitely a twisted form of love

2719
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:26,740
He mistakes it for his daughter's kindness

2720
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:27,250
You display this in your room, right?

2721
01:37:27,250 --> 01:37:29,480
You display this in your room, right?

2722
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:32,470
What a pitiful fellow!!

2723
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:34,090
This person is suspicious!!

2724
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:36,420
Certainly it seems this man is thought of

2725
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:39,190
by his daughter as just a strongman, however,

2726
01:37:39,210 --> 01:37:41,460
from this picture, I can see no ill intentions

2727
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:44,160
There's no particular ill intention.

2728
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:44,160
Where's my younger brother gone to then?

2729
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:47,200
Papa, let's go

2730
01:37:47,670 --> 01:37:50,230
Matsuzaka, you're so bad

2731
01:37:48,830 --> 01:37:49,770
Yeah

2732
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:57,710
I see...

2733
01:37:56,090 --> 01:37:57,710
So it's Triton.

2734
01:38:02,850 --> 01:38:04,420
It's old, right?

2735
01:38:04,430 --> 01:38:07,180
From when we were elementary school students...

2736
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:09,220
Even we

2737
01:38:08,540 --> 01:38:09,220
don't recognise it

2738
01:38:09,220 --> 01:38:11,490
I don't

2739
01:38:09,220 --> 01:38:11,490
recognise it either

2740
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:19,350
Just a bit left of the bus ride

2741
01:38:12,270 --> 01:38:19,350
They draw closer to the physical center.

2742
01:38:12,660 --> 01:38:14,710
With just a bit left of the bus ride,

2743
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:17,250
they draw closer

2744
01:38:17,550 --> 01:38:19,050
to their destination: the physical center

2745
01:38:20,930 --> 01:38:22,770
Hm?

2746
01:38:23,900 --> 01:38:24,870
What is this?

2747
01:38:25,350 --> 01:38:27,360
Hm? Isn't this...

2748
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:28,610
We've reached the grounds of a school

2749
01:38:30,190 --> 01:38:31,980
The stage for a new challenge

2750
01:38:36,450 --> 01:38:41,150
A battle with new assassins begins!

2751
01:38:36,450 --> 01:38:41,150
Aiming for physical ability and teamwork

2752
01:38:36,450 --> 01:38:41,150
Here, a battle with still unknown assassins await

2753
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:42,070
Let's go

2754
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:44,290
Reached the Physical Center

2755
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:43,750
Over here

2756
01:38:44,970 --> 01:38:50,260
In their minds, unpleasant memories awaken

2757
01:38:44,970 --> 01:38:50,260
Indeed, unpleasant memories begin to awaken in their minds

2758
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:53,100
An abandoned school...

2759
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:53,100
This is an abandoned school's grounds too..?

2760
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:55,100
Physical Center entrance

2761
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:55,500
Huh?

2762
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:55,500
Huh?

2763
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:55,500
Huh?

2764
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:55,500
Huh?

2765
01:38:58,200 --> 01:38:59,740
Wait!!

2766
01:38:59,740 --> 01:39:00,100
Don't go

2767
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:00,840
Don't go

2768
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:01,840
Please don't go!!

2769
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:02,660
He's laughing; look!

2770
01:39:02,670 --> 01:39:04,680
Look; you're laughing

2771
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:04,230
What is it?

2772
01:39:04,660 --> 01:39:07,140
You stumbled and laughed

2773
01:39:07,140 --> 01:39:08,710
Hey, say something about this!!

2774
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:09,800
What the...

2775
01:39:08,710 --> 01:39:09,980
Say something about this!!

2776
01:39:10,830 --> 01:39:12,120
Someone!!

2777
01:39:12,130 --> 01:39:13,750
Someone, come over here!!

2778
01:39:13,750 --> 01:39:15,220
Someone, come over here!!

2779
01:39:15,220 --> 01:39:16,420
This bump made you stumble

2780
01:39:16,420 --> 01:39:17,920
This bump made you stumble

2781
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:19,290
Hurry up!!

2782
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:21,290
What a big fuss

2783
01:39:19,290 --> 01:39:22,190
Let's just move on

2784
01:39:24,460 --> 01:39:25,030
No way!!

2785
01:39:24,460 --> 01:39:26,030
How persistent!

2786
01:39:25,030 --> 01:39:27,030
Don't go!!

2787
01:39:26,830 --> 01:39:28,030
Do it, do it, do it

2788
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:37,480
Okay!!

2789
01:39:41,860 --> 01:39:43,150
This was always here

2790
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:44,100
This is amazing

2791
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:45,050
it was not sudden

2792
01:39:44,950 --> 01:39:46,250
He was probably relieved it (bus ride) was over;

2793
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:46,720
he went bam then went ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

2794
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:46,920
he went bam then went ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

2795
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:47,120
he went bam then went ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

2796
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:47,350
he went bam then went ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

2797
01:39:47,350 --> 01:39:47,550
he went bam then went ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

2798
01:39:47,550 --> 01:39:49,020
he went bam then went ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

2799
01:39:49,490 --> 01:39:52,490
What happened with him?

2800
01:39:54,630 --> 01:39:55,390
We're here

2801
01:39:55,940 --> 01:39:56,630
Please go in

2802
01:39:56,790 --> 01:39:57,140
We're here

2803
01:39:57,360 --> 01:40:01,830
Physical Center waiting room

2804
01:39:57,900 --> 01:39:58,780
Ah... seriously?

2805
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:00,900
Oh ma~~~n...

2806
01:40:03,750 --> 01:40:05,570
Training clothes have been prepared

2807
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:06,390
Can everyone change into the training clothes?

2808
01:40:06,970 --> 01:40:09,660
This is training for scientists?

2809
01:40:08,770 --> 01:40:09,860
Yeah, seriously?

2810
01:40:10,570 --> 01:40:18,350
Before the physical training,

2811
01:40:10,570 --> 01:40:18,350
they change into suitable outfits

2812
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:12,580
The 5 change into clothes which are better for moving around in,

2813
01:40:12,830 --> 01:40:16,280
They change into suitable clothes to take part

2814
01:40:12,830 --> 01:40:16,280
and in order to build the physicality needed for scientists,

2815
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:18,280
in the training to increase the strength necessary for a scientist.

2816
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:18,280
they will challenge the upcoming training.

2817
01:40:20,580 --> 01:40:23,970
Sudden Siren Alarm

2818
01:40:25,570 --> 01:40:25,720
They've come

2819
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:25,890
They've come

2820
01:40:25,890 --> 01:40:27,560
They've come

2821
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:33,930
Oni appears

2822
01:40:30,290 --> 01:40:32,400
What, this is scary...

2823
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:35,400
They've come, they've come

2824
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:41,370
Tickles!

2825
01:40:41,370 --> 01:40:42,040
Tickles!

2826
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:42,970
They're tickling me!!

2827
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:44,110
They're tickling me!!

2828
01:40:44,110 --> 01:40:44,790
They're tickling me!!

2829
01:40:44,790 --> 01:40:46,580
It tickkklllesss!!!

2830
01:40:46,930 --> 01:40:48,680
It tickles, it tickles

2831
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:49,880
You're getting tickled so much

2832
01:40:49,450 --> 01:40:51,480
Same as usual

2833
01:40:50,450 --> 01:40:51,880
That's true

2834
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:52,980
I'm going to hit my head

2835
01:40:52,450 --> 01:40:54,020
See you later

2836
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:55,300
I'm definitely going to hit my head somewhere

2837
01:40:56,490 --> 01:40:57,390
Right then

2838
01:40:58,170 --> 01:40:59,620
Hey guys

2839
01:40:58,940 --> 01:40:59,670
What?

2840
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:01,560
That was part of your special training

2841
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:03,290
I'm sure you all know by now

2842
01:41:03,290 --> 01:41:04,330
During the training you may laugh

2843
01:41:04,330 --> 01:41:06,000
During the training you may laugh

2844
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,080
But if you get caught by an oni, you will be punished severely

2845
01:41:08,070 --> 01:41:09,500
But if you get caught by an oni, you will be punished severely

2846
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:12,500
Why do scientists have to, like, run around and stuff?

2847
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:14,540
Why do scientists have to, like, run around and stuff?

2848
01:41:14,540 --> 01:41:15,640
For your metabolism and teamwork

2849
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:16,840
For your metabolism and teamwork

2850
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:18,960
Every time, it's for that...

2851
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:19,780
I'm sorry, but there is absolutely no teamwork

2852
01:41:19,780 --> 01:41:20,860
I'm sorry but there is absolutely no teamwork

2853
01:41:21,510 --> 01:41:23,010
But if it's just you guys, there will be too much horrible Kansai air

2854
01:41:23,010 --> 01:41:25,030
But if it's just you guys, there will be too much horrible Kansai air

2855
01:41:24,950 --> 01:41:27,620
Horrible air?

2856
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:28,720
What is horrible Kansai air?

2857
01:41:27,970 --> 01:41:29,650
What is it?

2858
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:29,720
So in order to instill some elegant Tokyo air,

2859
01:41:29,720 --> 01:41:32,690
So in order to instill some elegant Tokyo air,

2860
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:35,790
we've got a special guest to come on the program

2861
01:41:34,980 --> 01:41:36,160
Oh, who?

2862
01:41:35,090 --> 01:41:36,510
Who?

2863
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:37,110
This person

2864
01:41:36,460 --> 01:41:38,030
Who?

2865
01:41:36,990 --> 01:41:38,100
Who is it?

2866
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:41,830
HIROMI

2867
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:41,830
Helper

2868
01:41:41,830 --> 01:41:43,770
He's not elegant in the slightest...

2869
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:44,140
I know

2870
01:41:44,150 --> 01:41:45,170
That's true

2871
01:41:44,540 --> 01:41:46,470
He's not "elegant Tokyo air" at all!

2872
01:41:44,970 --> 01:41:46,750
That's true

2873
01:41:46,070 --> 01:41:48,760
I was thinking it would be some famous actor

2874
01:41:47,070 --> 01:41:47,870
He literally represents the scum of Tokyo!!

2875
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:49,290
I know!

2876
01:41:47,870 --> 01:41:49,610
He literally represents the scum of Tokyo!!

2877
01:41:49,940 --> 01:41:51,210
What the hell do you mean "Scum"!?

2878
01:41:51,490 --> 01:41:53,480
I've been waiting back there forever!!

2879
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:57,630
I was thinking a famous actor would be coming on...

2880
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:58,330
You're making a huge mistake if you think that!

2881
01:41:57,130 --> 01:41:58,280
I'm so sorry

2882
01:41:58,350 --> 01:41:59,230
I can't help but feel really let down though

2883
01:41:59,230 --> 01:42:00,750
I can't help but feel really let down though

2884
01:42:00,820 --> 01:42:01,700
It's not like I'm here because I want to be!!

2885
01:42:01,700 --> 01:42:03,570
It's not like I'm here because I want to be!!

2886
01:42:03,550 --> 01:42:04,420
Oh right...

2887
01:42:03,870 --> 01:42:05,240
I know, right?

2888
01:42:05,390 --> 01:42:06,660
My kids have always been watching this program

2889
01:42:06,660 --> 01:42:07,860
My kids have always been watching this program

2890
01:42:07,860 --> 01:42:09,930
They said, "You should go, you should go!"

2891
01:42:09,930 --> 01:42:10,810
But I said like "I  really don't want to go"

2892
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:12,160
But I said like "I really don't want to go!"

2893
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:14,100
I have no energy, and it hurts like hell

2894
01:42:14,100 --> 01:42:15,300
I have no energy, and it hurts like hell

2895
01:42:15,830 --> 01:42:21,820
Hiromi enters!!

2896
01:42:15,830 --> 01:42:21,820
Same generation as Downtown

2897
01:42:16,350 --> 01:42:18,250
He's from the same generation as Downtown: Hiromi enters

2898
01:42:18,250 --> 01:42:20,250
He's from the same generation as Downtown: Hiromi enters

2899
01:42:20,250 --> 01:42:23,140
This veteran hasn't been put through his paces

2900
01:42:22,020 --> 01:42:26,780
The veteran who hasn't been put through his paces lately will see hell afterwards!

2901
01:42:23,140 --> 01:42:24,440
After this, he will experience hell

2902
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:26,430
After this, he will experience hell

2903
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:31,030
Damn, the field is huge this time as well...

2904
01:42:27,460 --> 01:42:32,380
Training Ground

2905
01:42:30,930 --> 01:42:32,050
I know

2906
01:42:32,650 --> 01:42:35,750
Guys, shall we head over to Matsumoto?

2907
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:35,800
Oh yeah.

2908
01:42:36,690 --> 01:42:39,490
He hasn't seen Hiromi yet

2909
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:39,810
That's true

2910
01:42:38,890 --> 01:42:40,460
Oh yeah

2911
01:42:39,570 --> 01:42:41,810
We need to let him know it's Hiromi this year

2912
01:42:40,590 --> 01:42:42,040
Yeah, since this year is Hiromi, he'll be shocked.

2913
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:43,460
Yeah, since this year is Hiromi, he'll be shocked.

2914
01:42:43,460 --> 01:42:43,860
Everyone seems so disappointed it's me

2915
01:42:43,860 --> 01:42:45,730
Everyone seems so disappointed it's me

2916
01:42:46,300 --> 01:42:47,180
See?

2917
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:47,900
HIROMI!!

2918
01:42:47,820 --> 01:42:49,550
Of course he'll react like that...

2919
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:50,850
Hurry up and save me!

2920
01:42:51,750 --> 01:42:52,250
When I appeared, they were all so disappointed

2921
01:42:52,250 --> 01:42:54,520
When I appeared, they were all so disappointed

2922
01:42:54,510 --> 01:42:55,420
Usually a younger guy appears

2923
01:42:55,420 --> 01:42:57,140
Usually a younger guy appears

2924
01:42:57,440 --> 01:42:59,980
I told them I'm actor material...

2925
01:42:59,990 --> 01:43:02,160
I'll get excited!!

2926
01:43:01,060 --> 01:43:03,180
No, I don't care but let's hurry it up

2927
01:43:03,410 --> 01:43:05,680
We need the key, I presume again?

2928
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:06,230
Yeah, everyone, line up

2929
01:43:04,700 --> 01:43:05,900
We'll be really quick

2930
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:06,950
We will find it straight away

2931
01:43:06,730 --> 01:43:08,650
We got it

2932
01:43:07,620 --> 01:43:08,940
First time.

2933
01:43:09,390 --> 01:43:09,600
When they start, onis appear.

2934
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:13,520
When they start, onis appear.

2935
01:43:09,970 --> 01:43:13,710
When they start, a few onis will appear.

2936
01:43:13,970 --> 01:43:17,810
Every 10 minutes, more will come out

2937
01:43:18,130 --> 01:43:23,270
Run away from them, and find the key

2938
01:43:18,330 --> 01:43:20,280
Whilst running away from the Onis,

2939
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:24,200
they must find the key to free Matsumoto.

2940
01:43:23,650 --> 01:43:30,940
If they get the wrong key, Matsumoto will be punished.

2941
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:26,720
However, if they get the wrong key,

2942
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:30,160
Matsumoto will be punished severely.

2943
01:43:31,290 --> 01:43:33,510
Do not get caught, scientists!

2944
01:43:31,890 --> 01:43:35,960
Do not get caught,

2945
01:43:31,990 --> 01:43:35,960
scientists!

2946
01:43:33,510 --> 01:43:35,960
Do not get caught, scientists!

2947
01:43:36,110 --> 01:43:37,000
Right then, special training, commence!

2948
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,300
Right then, special training, commence!

2949
01:43:38,180 --> 01:43:40,150
They're coming, they're coming!

2950
01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:39,550
Right then, special training, commence!

2951
01:43:39,330 --> 01:43:43,990
Special training commences!

2952
01:43:40,450 --> 01:43:41,800
There he is!

2953
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:44,490
Here they come

2954
01:43:44,190 --> 01:44:08,360
Slipper

2955
01:43:44,660 --> 01:43:46,720
Damn it, that one hurts like hell!!

2956
01:43:46,610 --> 01:43:48,240
Oh shit, oh shit

2957
01:43:47,860 --> 01:43:48,560
Here he comes!

2958
01:43:48,140 --> 01:43:49,140
He's coming!

2959
01:43:53,050 --> 01:43:55,000
Hamada-san!

2960
01:43:55,080 --> 01:43:58,070
Hamada-san got caught!

2961
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:00,490
Slippers hurt like hell...

2962
01:43:59,940 --> 01:44:00,940
And he always takes off the hat as if it's part of a ritual

2963
01:44:00,940 --> 01:44:03,340
And he always takes off the hat as if it's part of a ritual

2964
01:44:02,090 --> 01:44:03,460
Yeah, he does.

2965
01:44:04,980 --> 01:44:06,730
This hurts so much

2966
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:08,230
This will hurt...

2967
01:44:12,050 --> 01:44:15,400
Matsumoto alone again this year...

2968
01:44:16,890 --> 01:44:17,820
I never want that again!

2969
01:44:17,820 --> 01:44:19,090
I never want that again!

2970
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:23,190
And the Harisen hurts like hell too

2971
01:44:23,190 --> 01:44:23,860
Like on the followthrough, it can get you again.

2972
01:44:23,860 --> 01:44:25,710
Like on the followthrough, it can get you again.

2973
01:44:25,430 --> 01:44:26,210
Here comes another!

2974
01:44:25,700 --> 01:44:27,130
Here comes another one!

2975
01:44:25,710 --> 01:44:29,130
2nd Oni enters

2976
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:28,030
It's a harisen!

2977
01:44:27,030 --> 01:44:28,580
Harisen

2978
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:30,570
This hurts so much, right, Yama-chan?

2979
01:44:29,300 --> 01:45:03,870
Harisen

2980
01:44:30,630 --> 01:44:33,070
It really does.

2981
01:44:31,340 --> 01:44:33,840
Everyone, let's split up

2982
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:34,640
You fuckers, help me for fuck sakes!

2983
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:36,410
You fuckers, help me for fuck sakes!

2984
01:44:39,190 --> 01:44:41,280
Why are you coming for me?!

2985
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:43,980
Okay great, he's going for Hiromi-san

2986
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:45,720
He's going for Hiromi-san!

2987
01:44:45,050 --> 01:44:46,030
Run away! Run away, Hiromi-san!

2988
01:44:46,030 --> 01:44:48,450
Run away! Run away, Hiromi-san!

2989
01:44:48,470 --> 01:44:50,040
Oh shit!

2990
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:52,890
Hiromi-san!

2991
01:44:51,990 --> 01:44:53,310
Oh Hiromi...

2992
01:44:53,310 --> 01:44:54,840
He's fifty?

2993
01:44:53,590 --> 01:44:54,760
Yep

2994
01:44:54,530 --> 01:44:54,990
Here it comes: the Gaki style baptism.

2995
01:44:54,990 --> 01:44:56,330
Here it comes: the Gaki style baptism

2996
01:44:56,460 --> 01:44:58,030
Great stuff, Hiromi!

2997
01:45:00,230 --> 01:45:02,130
This really does hurt

2998
01:45:00,850 --> 01:45:03,870
Hiromi is baptised

2999
01:45:01,020 --> 01:45:02,750
It looks so painful

3000
01:45:04,170 --> 01:45:05,250
It hurts like hell, right?

3001
01:45:05,250 --> 01:45:06,290
It hurts like hell, right?

3002
01:45:06,290 --> 01:45:06,990
Oh man,oh man

3003
01:45:06,990 --> 01:45:08,720
Oh man, oh man

3004
01:45:10,110 --> 01:45:13,010
Damn, that hurt!

3005
01:45:10,910 --> 01:45:12,590
Right?

3006
01:45:11,860 --> 01:45:13,430
I know

3007
01:45:13,910 --> 01:45:15,980
You guys should be working hard to

3008
01:45:15,980 --> 01:45:17,650
aid us whilst running

3009
01:45:17,650 --> 01:45:20,950
Make it so we don't get the hits!

3010
01:45:17,900 --> 01:45:19,150
We are

3011
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:20,420
We are doing our best

3012
01:45:20,950 --> 01:45:21,500
Why the hell are you coming over here?!

3013
01:45:21,490 --> 01:45:22,950
Why the hell are you coming over here?!

3014
01:45:22,950 --> 01:45:23,690
Why are you standing over here?!

3015
01:45:23,690 --> 01:45:25,270
Why are you standing over here?!

3016
01:45:25,420 --> 01:45:26,220
I'm 50 years old as well!

3017
01:45:26,220 --> 01:45:28,160
I'm 50 years old as well!

3018
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:29,890
We are the 50's team!

3019
01:45:28,610 --> 01:45:30,230
You're still one of us!

3020
01:45:29,890 --> 01:45:31,060
You guys are still young!

3021
01:45:29,930 --> 01:45:35,980
The 48-year-old lies that he is 50.

3022
01:45:30,330 --> 01:45:32,360
You're still in your 40's...

3023
01:45:31,060 --> 01:45:32,900
You're still young, so help us!

3024
01:45:32,460 --> 01:45:34,130
He's in his 40's too

3025
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:34,850
You should be helping us

3026
01:45:34,850 --> 01:45:36,120
You should be helping us

3027
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:36,450
It's so cold

3028
01:45:35,850 --> 01:45:37,120
That's why it hurts so much

3029
01:45:37,150 --> 01:45:39,120
I know

3030
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:40,840
He's so annoying

3031
01:45:39,770 --> 01:45:40,720
It's alright if this is the worst...

3032
01:45:40,690 --> 01:45:42,770
It's alright if this is the worst...

3033
01:45:42,770 --> 01:45:43,570
Here they come

3034
01:45:43,460 --> 01:45:45,880
Here comes another

3035
01:45:43,570 --> 01:45:47,110
3rd Oni appears

3036
01:45:45,060 --> 01:45:46,530
That's not a Harisen

3037
01:45:46,530 --> 01:45:48,210
What the hell is that?

3038
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:48,760
What is that? He's holding something!

3039
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:49,360
What is that?

3040
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:49,780
What is that? He's holding something!

3041
01:45:50,150 --> 01:45:50,950
Front Door Mat!

3042
01:45:50,950 --> 01:45:52,680
It says "Front Door Mat"!

3043
01:45:51,270 --> 01:46:12,370
Front door mat

3044
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:53,750
Hey, youngsters!

3045
01:45:53,750 --> 01:45:54,850
Hey, youngsters!

3046
01:45:54,850 --> 01:45:57,190
There are no youngsters in Gaki!

3047
01:45:58,090 --> 01:45:58,670
You're kidding me, what?

3048
01:45:58,670 --> 01:45:59,790
You're kidding me, what?

3049
01:45:59,790 --> 01:46:00,090
What?

3050
01:46:00,090 --> 01:46:00,320
What?

3051
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:01,040
What?!

3052
01:46:00,870 --> 01:46:02,260
That's going to hurt, man!

3053
01:46:01,910 --> 01:46:02,890
Front Door Mat?

3054
01:46:03,260 --> 01:46:04,710
What's he going to do?

3055
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:04,930
That's going to hurt!

3056
01:46:04,930 --> 01:46:05,110
That's going to hurt!

3057
01:46:05,110 --> 01:46:05,660
That's going to hurt!

3058
01:46:05,610 --> 01:46:06,800
That will hurt...

3059
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:09,630
OWW!!

3060
01:46:08,430 --> 01:46:09,620
Oh man, that looked bad

3061
01:46:10,130 --> 01:46:11,350
That looked heavy

3062
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:13,240
How was it? Did Front Door Mat hurt?

3063
01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:16,170
How was it? Did Front Door Mat hurt?

3064
01:46:13,820 --> 01:46:14,960
What was that?

3065
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:16,310
Front Door Mat

3066
01:46:16,170 --> 01:46:17,910
Tanaka! That shit doesn't hurt, you fool!

3067
01:46:17,190 --> 01:46:18,580
Tanaka, you...

3068
01:46:17,910 --> 01:46:20,040
Tanaka! That shit doesn't hurt, you fool!

3069
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:24,030
What the hell is a Front Door Mat?!

3070
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,350
What the hell is a Front Door Mat?!

3071
01:46:25,350 --> 01:46:26,520
The Slipper and Harisen hurt way more than that!

3072
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:27,420
The Slipper and Harisen hurt way more than that!

3073
01:46:27,420 --> 01:46:28,300
Front Door mat hurts so damn much!

3074
01:46:28,270 --> 01:46:29,550
Front Door Mat hurts so damn much!!

3075
01:46:29,570 --> 01:46:34,160
Hamada doesn't appreciate the Front Door Mat.

3076
01:46:29,590 --> 01:46:31,520
That looked heavy though

3077
01:46:30,820 --> 01:46:32,620
Yeah it does!

3078
01:46:32,390 --> 01:46:34,940
Anyway, let's find the box

3079
01:46:34,240 --> 01:46:36,060
Find the box?

3080
01:46:35,780 --> 01:46:36,580
There is a box somewhere

3081
01:46:36,230 --> 01:46:37,360
Let's find it

3082
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:40,880
Here comes Front Door Mat

3083
01:46:39,930 --> 01:47:17,650
Front Door Mat

3084
01:46:40,510 --> 01:46:42,500
I'm telling you... It really hurts

3085
01:46:43,530 --> 01:46:45,400
Someone said it doesn't hurt at all!

3086
01:46:46,420 --> 01:46:49,840
Unfair Hamada Flees to Schoolhouse Alone

3087
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:50,910
Oh! There he goes!

3088
01:46:50,860 --> 01:46:51,990
He's off

3089
01:46:50,910 --> 01:46:52,510
He went over there!

3090
01:46:52,510 --> 01:46:54,510
It's because he said, "No way that hurt."

3091
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:56,030
It really does hurt!

3092
01:46:54,510 --> 01:46:56,010
The Oni got pissed

3093
01:46:56,180 --> 01:46:56,780
The key wouldn't just be lying around here somewhere, would it?

3094
01:46:56,780 --> 01:46:58,450
The key wouldn't just be lying around here somewhere, would it?

3095
01:46:58,450 --> 01:46:59,350
Oh shit!!

3096
01:47:00,350 --> 01:47:01,550
You're kidding me?!

3097
01:47:01,550 --> 01:47:01,850
What?! You came over here?!

3098
01:47:01,850 --> 01:47:03,490
What?! You came over here?!

3099
01:47:06,890 --> 01:47:08,010
Hold on a minute...

3100
01:47:07,210 --> 01:47:08,180
This is going to hurt...

3101
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:09,830
Damn...

3102
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:12,700
His cheeks, like, shook...

3103
01:47:13,430 --> 01:47:17,630
Close-Up Ugly Face

3104
01:47:15,930 --> 01:47:16,930
He wasn't kidding...

3105
01:47:16,570 --> 01:47:18,940
His cheeks shook!

3106
01:47:17,630 --> 01:47:18,270
The one thing you can't do is say something bad like that...

3107
01:47:18,270 --> 01:47:21,620
The one thing you can't do is say something bad like that...

3108
01:47:19,770 --> 01:47:21,260
He got hit

3109
01:47:21,590 --> 01:47:24,110
It's because he took the piss out of it

3110
01:47:24,510 --> 01:47:25,710
Tanaka. My bad.

3111
01:47:25,710 --> 01:47:28,060
Tanaka. My bad.

3112
01:47:26,260 --> 01:47:27,290
Right?

3113
01:47:26,930 --> 01:47:27,930
Really?

3114
01:47:28,050 --> 01:47:29,280
It hurts like hell, right?

3115
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:29,910
It does, it's so heavy!

3116
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:31,950
It is, right?

3117
01:47:29,910 --> 01:47:31,950
It does, it's so heavy!

3118
01:47:31,950 --> 01:47:33,750
It's because you took the piss out of the Front Door Mat...

3119
01:47:33,150 --> 01:47:34,520
I'm sorry...

3120
01:47:33,750 --> 01:47:34,520
It's because you took the piss out of the Front Door Mat...

3121
01:47:35,020 --> 01:47:37,190
Let's stop bitching about the Front Door Mat.

3122
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:37,090
Yeah, let's...

3123
01:47:37,190 --> 01:47:38,690
Someone go upstairs or like over there.

3124
01:47:38,690 --> 01:47:40,560
Someone go upstairs or like over there.

3125
01:47:38,770 --> 01:47:40,410
I will go over there...

3126
01:47:39,690 --> 01:47:40,990
Okay, let's find the key.

3127
01:47:40,670 --> 01:47:41,840
Yeah, let's.

3128
01:47:41,580 --> 01:47:43,310
That's right

3129
01:47:42,890 --> 01:47:47,480
They split up and search

3130
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:47,650
The 5 break up into 3 groups and look for the key.

3131
01:47:48,030 --> 01:47:50,270
Nothing here

3132
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:52,250
They should make it quite easy to find.

3133
01:47:52,700 --> 01:47:55,640
Shall we go over there then?

3134
01:47:56,710 --> 01:47:58,010
Hiromi, what the hell do you think you're doing using me as a shield?!

3135
01:47:58,010 --> 01:47:59,610
Hiromi, what the hell do you think you're doing using me as a shield?!

3136
01:47:59,860 --> 01:48:02,710
Hiromi uses Hamada as a shield

3137
01:48:01,130 --> 01:48:02,460
Tanaka!

3138
01:48:03,250 --> 01:48:05,080
Are you actually entering the rooms?

3139
01:48:05,050 --> 01:48:07,470
Yeah, actually enter the room!

3140
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,340
You have to enter the room!

3141
01:48:07,530 --> 01:48:08,970
Enter the room?

3142
01:48:08,970 --> 01:48:10,490
Here he comes...

3143
01:48:09,740 --> 01:48:11,760
Yeah you got to...

3144
01:48:09,950 --> 01:48:29,370
Slipper

3145
01:48:11,050 --> 01:48:12,170
OH SHIT!

3146
01:48:12,890 --> 01:48:13,890
That's scary

3147
01:48:13,890 --> 01:48:15,310
That's dangerous!

3148
01:48:15,310 --> 01:48:16,960
That's bad

3149
01:48:15,940 --> 01:48:17,480
What is it?!

3150
01:48:18,160 --> 01:48:18,910
What the hell?! What the hell, man?!

3151
01:48:18,910 --> 01:48:21,630
What the hell?! What the hell, man?!

3152
01:48:22,220 --> 01:48:23,930
What the hell is your problem?!

3153
01:48:23,250 --> 01:48:26,400
Hamada laughs hysterically at other people's misfortune

3154
01:48:23,930 --> 01:48:24,970
What is your problem?!

3155
01:48:27,390 --> 01:48:29,020
He looks so damn happy...

3156
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:30,810
This guy, the whole time,

3157
01:48:30,810 --> 01:48:31,890
was using me as a shield and pushing me from behind

3158
01:48:31,890 --> 01:48:33,240
was using me as a shield and pushing me from behind

3159
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:35,760
but then one came from behind

3160
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:37,550
That's the worst!

3161
01:48:37,550 --> 01:48:39,200
That was a heavy hit...

3162
01:48:40,730 --> 01:48:44,370
Meanwhile, Matsumoto was...

3163
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:46,040
What the hell are you doing here?!

3164
01:48:46,810 --> 01:48:48,760
It was SO DAMN hot in here!

3165
01:48:47,220 --> 01:48:49,260
Damn it's hot

3166
01:48:49,680 --> 01:48:52,010
It was SO HOT.

3167
01:48:49,990 --> 01:48:51,510
Goddamnit...

3168
01:48:52,010 --> 01:48:54,310
It was like a sauna in here...

3169
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:54,680
Ugh...

3170
01:48:53,630 --> 01:48:55,150
Seriously, man...

3171
01:48:55,630 --> 01:48:57,600
You're an old man!

3172
01:48:55,800 --> 01:49:00,540
Ugh... there's no shade...

3173
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:01,460
Wherever I sat, the sunlight got to me

3174
01:49:00,670 --> 01:49:02,640
Wherever I sit, I'm boiling...

3175
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:08,460
Direct sunlight is making Matsumoto drowsy

3176
01:49:09,330 --> 01:49:12,420
10 minutes since the start

3177
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:15,840
Increasing the number of Onis.

3178
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:15,750
More Oni appear

3179
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:20,110
10 minutes since the start

3180
01:49:20,110 --> 01:49:23,290
Increasing the number of Onis.

3181
01:49:20,260 --> 01:49:23,230
More Oni appear

3182
01:49:23,230 --> 01:49:26,560
They search the ground

3183
01:49:23,290 --> 01:49:24,810
Let's go over there

3184
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:25,730
There's a storehouse over there

3185
01:49:25,260 --> 01:49:26,700
Let's split up

3186
01:49:26,930 --> 01:49:27,730
Damn man, that hurt, that really hurt

3187
01:49:27,730 --> 01:49:29,680
Damn man, that hurt, that really hurt

3188
01:49:38,910 --> 01:49:42,810
I haven't been hit once yet

3189
01:49:42,810 --> 01:49:47,080
I wonder if the Oni knows that kind of thing

3190
01:49:44,950 --> 01:49:46,470
Hosei-san!

3191
01:49:47,850 --> 01:49:49,150
What?! Wait a minute!

3192
01:49:49,150 --> 01:49:51,390
Oh damn! What?

3193
01:49:51,270 --> 01:49:52,620
Wait a minute, what is it?!

3194
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:54,790
See?

3195
01:49:54,790 --> 01:49:57,330
I still haven't had anything done to me.

3196
01:49:55,860 --> 01:49:57,180
Right?

3197
01:49:57,330 --> 01:50:00,930
You were a bit too relaxed there though...

3198
01:50:00,930 --> 01:50:01,830
What is that?

3199
01:50:02,100 --> 01:50:03,600
Tekken? (Iron Fist)

3200
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:42,740
Tekken

3201
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:04,950
What the hell is "Tekken"?!

3202
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:07,740
I wonder if he's going to get punched...

3203
01:50:07,820 --> 01:50:09,640
Huh? He's been taken somewhere

3204
01:50:08,670 --> 01:50:08,840
What?!

3205
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:09,020
What?!

3206
01:50:09,020 --> 01:50:10,070
What?!

3207
01:50:10,070 --> 01:50:12,690
Where are we going?!

3208
01:50:10,270 --> 01:50:12,610
Tanaka got caught by a "Tekken"

3209
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:13,480
Hang on

3210
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:15,080
There are times they kidnap you?

3211
01:50:15,080 --> 01:50:15,860
Yes

3212
01:50:15,860 --> 01:50:18,030
Hold on a minute...

3213
01:50:17,730 --> 01:50:18,400
I'm so scared...

3214
01:50:18,450 --> 01:50:22,050
Tanaka gets taken into a small room

3215
01:50:19,050 --> 01:50:19,580
What, what, what??

3216
01:50:26,610 --> 01:50:29,790
The 53-year-old trips out in the same place...

3217
01:50:28,160 --> 01:50:28,610
What the...

3218
01:50:28,810 --> 01:50:29,610
This is

3219
01:50:29,530 --> 01:50:30,230
This is just...

3220
01:50:30,380 --> 01:50:31,830
It's where you take off your shoes...

3221
01:50:30,390 --> 01:50:30,760
Oh! Hamada-san!

3222
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:33,100
Oh! Hamada-san!

3223
01:50:32,180 --> 01:50:33,310
In the exact same place

3224
01:50:33,330 --> 01:50:34,510
Literally the same place.

3225
01:50:34,210 --> 01:50:35,170
Don't shush us!

3226
01:50:34,550 --> 01:50:36,020
It was the same place as before

3227
01:50:35,180 --> 01:50:36,530
It happened before as well!

3228
01:50:36,930 --> 01:50:39,150
Hamada-san, you make me want to cry!

3229
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:44,540
Tekken...

3230
01:50:44,510 --> 01:50:45,480
Oh, that Tekken.

3231
01:50:44,540 --> 01:50:49,610
Tekken

3232
01:50:45,410 --> 01:50:47,460
I get it now...

3233
01:50:47,460 --> 01:50:49,610
They sure do a lot of things to your face every year...

3234
01:50:49,610 --> 01:50:51,680
Live every year... Like, is this my thing?

3235
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:54,000
Are you really Tanaka?

3236
01:50:52,680 --> 01:50:53,930
Yes, I am

3237
01:50:53,120 --> 01:50:54,150
Really? You sure you're not Tekken?

3238
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:54,840
I'm Tanaka

3239
01:50:55,090 --> 01:50:55,990
I am Tanaka...

3240
01:50:56,020 --> 01:50:58,320
I'm not Tekken

3241
01:50:58,320 --> 01:50:59,820
He's so bold...

3242
01:51:00,260 --> 01:51:01,260
Tanaka, I'm so sorry but...

3243
01:51:00,340 --> 01:51:04,410
Rather than the make up, the fact he's balding stands out more

3244
01:51:01,460 --> 01:51:01,890
Really?

3245
01:51:02,490 --> 01:51:03,430
Tekken is balding...

3246
01:51:05,410 --> 01:51:06,030
The fact they did it so quickly, they've done a good job

3247
01:51:06,030 --> 01:51:07,980
The fact they did it so quickly, they've done a good job

3248
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:07,400
Yeah, it is

3249
01:51:07,980 --> 01:51:10,330
They did it really well to be honest

3250
01:51:10,330 --> 01:51:12,450
It says "Tekken" clearly on your head

3251
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:13,450
Right, come on, quickly...

3252
01:51:13,620 --> 01:51:14,860
Yeah let's find it

3253
01:51:13,890 --> 01:51:16,020
The key, the key.

3254
01:51:14,990 --> 01:51:16,020
Let's hurry up and end this

3255
01:51:16,310 --> 01:51:18,440
The key, the key, the key!

3256
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:20,110
Where is the key?

3257
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:21,700
Is there really a key even?

3258
01:51:22,130 --> 01:51:22,930
What is this?

3259
01:51:23,250 --> 01:51:23,730
Oh shit! What?! You scared me!!

3260
01:51:23,730 --> 01:51:24,330
Oh shit! What?! You scared me!!

3261
01:51:24,330 --> 01:51:25,530
Oh shit! What?! You scared me!!

3262
01:51:25,530 --> 01:51:26,150
Hold on! Shit!

3263
01:51:26,150 --> 01:51:27,750
Hold on! Shit!

3264
01:51:27,750 --> 01:51:29,520
What did it have written on it?

3265
01:51:27,770 --> 01:51:29,120
What did it say?

3266
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:32,920
101 Dalmatians?

3267
01:51:30,970 --> 01:52:01,550
101 Dalmatians

3268
01:51:31,420 --> 01:51:33,020
What the hell?

3269
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:33,290
What? What is 101 Dalmatians?

3270
01:51:33,290 --> 01:51:35,690
What? What is 101 Dalmatians?

3271
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:36,390
Why do they always take us away somewhere?

3272
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:37,660
Oh my God! What the hell is this?!

3273
01:51:37,660 --> 01:51:38,160
Oh my God! What the hell is this?!

3274
01:51:38,160 --> 01:51:40,300
I didn't know he was there at all just now

3275
01:51:39,460 --> 01:51:40,450
No, neither did I

3276
01:51:40,300 --> 01:51:42,400
They're evolving more and more...

3277
01:51:47,820 --> 01:51:53,140
101 Dalmatians balloons...

3278
01:51:51,560 --> 01:51:53,360
You just can't get away if this happened to you...

3279
01:51:55,400 --> 01:51:56,810
This is awful!

3280
01:51:55,730 --> 01:51:57,050
This is just...

3281
01:51:57,380 --> 01:51:59,200
It'd be so hard to run away!

3282
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:00,250
This is the worst!

3283
01:52:01,550 --> 01:52:03,720
Hosei-san is back

3284
01:52:01,990 --> 01:52:03,770
There are SO many!

3285
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:06,170
What are you bringing with you there?

3286
01:52:06,170 --> 01:52:07,220
They'll find you, man...

3287
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:08,510
This is just...

3288
01:52:07,890 --> 01:52:08,790
It's disgusting

3289
01:52:08,740 --> 01:52:10,460
If we run next to you,

3290
01:52:10,460 --> 01:52:11,360
we'll get found

3291
01:52:11,580 --> 01:52:13,930
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?!

3292
01:52:16,100 --> 01:52:18,270
Please take a look at this!

3293
01:52:18,270 --> 01:52:20,970
I don't get the point of it!

3294
01:52:20,970 --> 01:52:22,340
You're their owner...

3295
01:52:22,670 --> 01:52:24,290
Yama-chan I'm sorry but...

3296
01:52:24,540 --> 01:52:26,140
It got caught

3297
01:52:26,140 --> 01:52:28,310
Some of your dogs went off somewhere...

3298
01:52:28,760 --> 01:52:31,330
You haven't got 101 anymore, there's 5 over there...

3299
01:52:29,510 --> 01:52:31,350
That's no good, you got to look after them...

3300
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:34,420
It broke off

3301
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:35,100
Some of them broke off

3302
01:52:34,420 --> 01:52:37,090
About 70 of them went off somewhere...

3303
01:52:37,020 --> 01:52:38,590
They just went off...

3304
01:52:39,420 --> 01:52:39,890
You've gone and left like 70 of them over there...

3305
01:52:39,890 --> 01:52:40,590
You've gone and left like 70 of them over there...

3306
01:52:40,590 --> 01:52:42,940
You've gone and left like 70 of them over there...

3307
01:52:41,690 --> 01:52:42,490
He's right!

3308
01:52:42,940 --> 01:52:45,330
There's definitely not 101 Dalmatians here.

3309
01:52:44,780 --> 01:52:45,530
Go and get them back!

3310
01:52:45,410 --> 01:52:46,830
Oh, who cares about that

3311
01:52:46,610 --> 01:52:48,700
No no, do it properly

3312
01:52:46,900 --> 01:52:48,150
We have to do it properly...

3313
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:50,870
Yeah, if they put it on you, you got to put it on properly

3314
01:52:49,450 --> 01:52:50,330
Yes, put it on...

3315
01:52:53,540 --> 01:52:54,820
Not going to lie, but I don't... want to be near you right now

3316
01:52:54,820 --> 01:52:57,170
Not going to lie, but I don't... want to be near you right now

3317
01:52:57,170 --> 01:52:59,840
They're going everywhere though!

3318
01:52:58,640 --> 01:53:01,130
No no, it's because you moved!

3319
01:53:00,610 --> 01:53:02,410
Hamada-san, there are 2 dogs...

3320
01:53:02,410 --> 01:53:06,150
You got 2 dogs for yourself?

3321
01:53:06,230 --> 01:53:07,200
No no!

3322
01:53:06,230 --> 01:53:10,890
For some reason, 2 have gone to Hamada...

3323
01:53:07,600 --> 01:53:09,750
You can't take them off!

3324
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:09,740
How the hell did that happen?

3325
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:10,240
You've got 2...

3326
01:53:11,020 --> 01:53:12,970
They like you, huh?

3327
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:12,470
From over there?

3328
01:53:12,590 --> 01:53:13,290
Seems it

3329
01:53:14,440 --> 01:53:15,530
That's ridiculous...

3330
01:53:16,690 --> 01:53:18,510
What the hell?!

3331
01:53:17,460 --> 01:53:20,600
Sudden gust of wind

3332
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:21,500
WAIT!!

3333
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:22,430
Wait!

3334
01:53:22,430 --> 01:53:23,930
PLEASE WAIT!!

3335
01:53:26,150 --> 01:53:57,600
Slipper

3336
01:53:28,240 --> 01:53:30,240
No way! You're kidding me!

3337
01:53:31,010 --> 01:53:32,340
He's got 2 dogs with him

3338
01:53:32,910 --> 01:53:33,580
Wait! Pups, are you okay?!

3339
01:53:33,580 --> 01:53:36,460
Wait! Pups, are you okay?!

3340
01:53:36,650 --> 01:53:38,480
This is getting ridiculous!!

3341
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:38,830
Hold on, hold on!

3342
01:53:40,050 --> 01:53:42,100
He's getting smacked as well!

3343
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:43,870
Over there, he just got smacked by a slipper!

3344
01:53:43,940 --> 01:53:44,490
A slipper?

3345
01:53:45,540 --> 01:53:45,890
Wait!

3346
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:50,290
He's carrying on!

3347
01:53:49,060 --> 01:53:49,610
Hold on a minute!

3348
01:53:51,110 --> 01:53:51,780
The dogs are just...

3349
01:53:55,100 --> 01:53:56,130
This is ridiculous. Everything just now was ridiculous!

3350
01:53:56,130 --> 01:53:57,600
This is ridiculous. Everything just now was ridiculous!

3351
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,520
The dogs! The dogs just went over there...

3352
01:53:58,670 --> 01:54:00,070
Wow, the dogs!

3353
01:54:00,070 --> 01:54:01,720
One of the dogs is just floating

3354
01:54:01,940 --> 01:54:02,320
What the hell is happening here right now?!

3355
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:02,620
What the hell is happening here right now?!

3356
01:54:02,620 --> 01:54:05,240
What the hell is happening here right now?!

3357
01:54:04,760 --> 01:54:06,130
I have no idea...

3358
01:54:07,580 --> 01:54:08,750
This is ridiculous

3359
01:54:08,360 --> 01:54:11,350
Please catch them all!

3360
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:12,530
I don't understand what he's trying to do

3361
01:54:12,530 --> 01:54:14,150
What the hell is going on here?

3362
01:54:14,620 --> 01:54:16,400
This is not something we expected...

3363
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:18,890
I didn't plan on having these stuck on me either...

3364
01:54:20,790 --> 01:54:21,960
The dogs like you so it's easy for you to keep them

3365
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:24,160
The dogs like you so it's easy for you to keep them

3366
01:54:25,200 --> 01:54:27,030
How the hell did that happen?

3367
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:29,130
That was seriously amazing though

3368
01:54:28,580 --> 01:54:29,670
I don't know

3369
01:54:29,700 --> 01:54:31,270
But seriously come on, enough is enough

3370
01:54:31,270 --> 01:54:33,470
How did it attach itself to me like this

3371
01:54:33,470 --> 01:54:34,820
By the way it's tied, I can only presume

3372
01:54:34,820 --> 01:54:36,940
someone has tied it onto me...

3373
01:54:37,290 --> 01:54:40,960
Someone had to pass through the thread through here

3374
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:44,080
or it would never tie itself up like this

3375
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:45,930
Someone's tied a knot here...

3376
01:54:45,320 --> 01:54:47,600
It wouldn't be able to do that itself just by the wind blowing the dogs over...

3377
01:54:45,930 --> 01:54:48,050
What's up?

3378
01:54:47,670 --> 01:54:48,670
No way...

3379
01:54:48,440 --> 01:54:49,640
I'm sorry but

3380
01:54:49,820 --> 01:54:51,720
Yama-chan's dog came...

3381
01:54:51,720 --> 01:54:53,420
and we were all panicking trying to pick them up, right?

3382
01:54:53,420 --> 01:54:54,840
And by doing that, is it possible for a knot to just happen like this?

3383
01:54:54,840 --> 01:54:56,790
And by doing that, is it possible for a knot to just happen like this?

3384
01:54:57,030 --> 01:54:59,730
Wait? Who?

3385
01:54:57,860 --> 01:54:59,680
Umm, no, that shouldn't be possible

3386
01:54:59,810 --> 01:55:00,400
So that means

3387
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:01,830
That one of you four tied them onto me

3388
01:55:01,830 --> 01:55:03,300
That one of you four tied them onto me

3389
01:55:03,450 --> 01:55:04,620
I had

3390
01:55:04,900 --> 01:55:07,650
all the Dalmatians near me so I wouldn't have been able to

3391
01:55:08,070 --> 01:55:09,460
So I don't know anything, it wasn't me

3392
01:55:09,290 --> 01:55:11,110
That's not necessarily true though...

3393
01:55:11,370 --> 01:55:13,060
What?

3394
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:14,740
That's not necessarily true though?

3395
01:55:16,180 --> 01:55:18,380
I went straight away towards him

3396
01:55:18,730 --> 01:55:19,650
When I got back

3397
01:55:20,270 --> 01:55:20,850
something was...

3398
01:55:20,450 --> 01:55:20,900
But

3399
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:22,950
When that happened, I...

3400
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:22,920
Yeah that's true, you're fine

3401
01:55:22,690 --> 01:55:24,220
Right? It's not me.

3402
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:23,750
Yeah, you're fine

3403
01:55:23,970 --> 01:55:25,170
I think this...

3404
01:55:25,390 --> 01:55:27,020
This is the work of someone good with their hands...

3405
01:55:27,340 --> 01:55:27,940
I see

3406
01:55:27,620 --> 01:55:28,890
To make a knot like this

3407
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:30,690
Someone that is good at renovating

3408
01:55:30,690 --> 01:55:34,200
Someone that is good at renovating

3409
01:55:31,850 --> 01:55:33,380
I see

3410
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:35,530
You know me, I can't do that kind of thing

3411
01:55:35,530 --> 01:55:36,700
You know me, I can't do that kind of thing

3412
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:37,270
True, you don't do that kind of thing after all

3413
01:55:36,830 --> 01:55:38,950
That's true, you're bad with that kind of thing...

3414
01:55:38,950 --> 01:55:40,770
Come over here

3415
01:55:40,770 --> 01:55:41,670
You guys do this every year so you're friends and all

3416
01:55:41,670 --> 01:55:44,040
You guys do this every year so you're friends and all

3417
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:45,240
And I get thatyou want to pick on the Kansai guy...

3418
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:47,240
And I get that you want to pick on the Kansai guy...

3419
01:55:47,240 --> 01:55:49,180
And I get that you want to pick on the Kansai guy...

3420
01:55:49,180 --> 01:55:51,550
Would I really do that? I'm 52, guys...

3421
01:55:51,550 --> 01:55:54,050
Would I really do that? I'm 52, guys...

3422
01:55:54,580 --> 01:55:55,500
You really think...?

3423
01:55:55,820 --> 01:55:56,990
You're the culprit! You!

3424
01:55:56,990 --> 01:55:58,120
You're the culprit! You!

3425
01:55:58,120 --> 01:55:59,620
But for a guy to not notice someone tying up a knot like this on him...

3426
01:55:59,620 --> 01:56:00,890
But for a guy to not notice someone tying up a knot like this on him...

3427
01:56:00,890 --> 01:56:03,390
How stupid do you have to be?!

3428
01:56:03,460 --> 01:56:04,460
That's true...

3429
01:56:04,460 --> 01:56:05,960
He's right, he didn't have a clue...

3430
01:56:04,730 --> 01:56:05,850
He's right

3431
01:56:06,010 --> 01:56:11,500
Hamada doesn't realise that the dogs were being tied up onto him

3432
01:56:06,580 --> 01:56:08,280
The whole time whilst he was walking

3433
01:56:08,900 --> 01:56:11,120
I was tying a knot behind him and for him not to realise

3434
01:56:11,500 --> 01:56:12,550
Seriously, he must be an idiot?

3435
01:56:12,550 --> 01:56:15,020
Seriously, he must be an idiot?

3436
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:16,570
This is honestly...

3437
01:56:14,670 --> 01:56:15,790
So bad...

3438
01:56:18,270 --> 01:56:19,710
20 minutes has passed

3439
01:56:20,580 --> 01:56:22,800
Increasing the number of Onis...

3440
01:56:20,660 --> 01:56:23,610
More Oni appear

3441
01:56:23,630 --> 01:56:27,280
Restart the search around the school

3442
01:56:24,380 --> 01:56:25,580
Isn't it somewhere around here?

3443
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:26,700
The 5 restart their search

3444
01:56:27,400 --> 01:57:44,330
Utopia

3445
01:56:27,770 --> 01:56:29,100
when a black

3446
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:30,640
shadow appears.

3447
01:56:32,510 --> 01:56:33,860
Don't lose focus, guys

3448
01:56:34,170 --> 01:56:34,890
Don't lose focus!

3449
01:56:35,310 --> 01:56:36,190
Oh man!

3450
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:40,900
What the hell!?

3451
01:56:39,430 --> 01:56:41,130
Yama-chan, NICE!

3452
01:56:40,900 --> 01:56:43,500
WHAT THE HELL!?

3453
01:56:42,450 --> 01:56:43,380
Hosei-san, NICE

3454
01:56:43,150 --> 01:56:44,880
They might do something real bad...

3455
01:56:44,280 --> 01:56:45,520
Great stuff

3456
01:56:46,040 --> 01:56:47,370
Well played

3457
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:47,500
Outside apparently...

3458
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:49,120
You're going outside

3459
01:56:49,420 --> 01:56:51,410
Utopia

3460
01:56:49,620 --> 01:56:49,840
What?

3461
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:50,070
Where? Where?

3462
01:56:50,070 --> 01:56:51,890
Where? Where?

3463
01:56:52,990 --> 01:56:54,510
It's "Utopia"...

3464
01:56:53,730 --> 01:56:54,830
I don't get it

3465
01:56:54,510 --> 01:56:54,760
Here it comes

3466
01:56:54,760 --> 01:56:55,160
It's coming, it's coming

3467
01:56:55,160 --> 01:56:56,180
It's coming

3468
01:56:56,180 --> 01:56:58,330
It came from above

3469
01:56:57,930 --> 01:56:59,380
Is he going to jump from there..?

3470
01:56:59,350 --> 01:57:00,130
What is this?

3471
01:57:01,320 --> 01:57:01,950
Onto him?

3472
01:57:02,200 --> 01:57:03,490
Oh man, what is this?

3473
01:57:02,200 --> 01:57:03,600
Oh man, this?

3474
01:57:03,900 --> 01:57:07,760
Rubber Patch from 4 metres

3475
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:05,740
Oh I get it, Utopia...

3476
01:57:06,590 --> 01:57:07,390
with the rubber patch

3477
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:08,690
Oh man, that's terrifying

3478
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:09,460
Hamada is laughing the whole time...

3479
01:57:08,690 --> 01:57:10,060
Oh man, that's terrifying

3480
01:57:11,960 --> 01:57:12,730
This is scary, like seriously so scary!

3481
01:57:12,730 --> 01:57:15,230
This is scary, like seriously so scary!

3482
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:14,500
OH man!!

3483
01:57:14,410 --> 01:57:15,780
This would be terrifying

3484
01:57:15,850 --> 01:57:16,500
Yeah it would be

3485
01:57:17,670 --> 01:57:22,940
The veteran comedian is terrified

3486
01:57:20,250 --> 01:57:22,670
Hold on, I am an old man!

3487
01:57:26,340 --> 01:57:27,080
He says you can still go further back

3488
01:57:27,080 --> 01:57:28,360
He says you can still go further back...

3489
01:57:28,360 --> 01:57:28,980
He says keep going

3490
01:57:28,980 --> 01:57:29,980
He says keep going

3491
01:57:30,180 --> 01:57:33,750
There he is! Evil Hosei!

3492
01:57:30,280 --> 01:57:31,680
He says keep going

3493
01:57:32,430 --> 01:57:33,770
This is bad

3494
01:57:34,120 --> 01:57:35,270
He really is evil...

3495
01:57:35,120 --> 01:57:36,000
This is dangerous...

3496
01:57:35,670 --> 01:57:36,690
Here it comes!

3497
01:57:36,790 --> 01:57:38,570
This is scary!

3498
01:57:43,930 --> 01:57:45,180
That has got to hurt!

3499
01:57:46,300 --> 01:57:48,310
That was brilliant

3500
01:57:46,660 --> 01:57:47,660
The one who pushed you before was Yama-chan by the way...

3501
01:57:47,660 --> 01:57:49,230
The one who pushed you before was Yama-chan by the way...

3502
01:57:48,360 --> 01:57:49,250
That's not true!

3503
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:50,250
It was...

3504
01:57:49,480 --> 01:57:51,200
Hiromi-san, it wasn't just me

3505
01:57:51,650 --> 01:57:53,350
Hold on a minute

3506
01:57:53,350 --> 01:57:54,070
Your faces are still scattered so I can't see you very well

3507
01:57:54,070 --> 01:57:57,110
Your faces are still scattered so I can't see you very well

3508
01:57:55,770 --> 01:57:56,390
I understand...

3509
01:57:57,110 --> 01:58:00,440
The sun is there as well...

3510
01:57:58,440 --> 01:57:59,180
Oh yeah, that's true

3511
01:57:59,560 --> 01:58:00,310
We get you...

3512
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:06,350
25 minutes since the start

3513
01:58:01,380 --> 01:58:03,500
25 minutes since the start

3514
01:58:04,450 --> 01:58:05,930
They cannot find the key

3515
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:07,380
Hama-chan and Cookie, you go over there

3516
01:58:07,380 --> 01:58:08,150
Hama-chan and Cookie, you go over there

3517
01:58:08,150 --> 01:58:09,750
Hama-chan and Cookie, you go over there

3518
01:58:09,750 --> 01:58:11,720
Is this dog's name Cookie?

3519
01:58:11,720 --> 01:58:14,640
What the hell are you on about?!

3520
01:58:14,640 --> 01:58:17,330
Why the hell is his name Cookie?!

3521
01:58:17,340 --> 01:58:21,500
They restart their search

3522
01:58:18,610 --> 01:58:19,930
They restart their search

3523
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:23,630
But seriously...

3524
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:23,330
Hold on. Did we go over there?

3525
01:58:23,330 --> 01:58:25,870
Hold on. Did we go over there?

3526
01:58:24,270 --> 01:58:24,930
Umm no we haven't.

3527
01:58:25,600 --> 01:58:26,450
We haven't been to the end

3528
01:58:25,900 --> 01:58:26,890
Right over there...

3529
01:58:27,170 --> 01:58:29,270
Hey! I found it!

3530
01:58:29,270 --> 01:58:30,220
Hey! I found it!

3531
01:58:30,260 --> 01:58:31,120
Damn that's big!

3532
01:58:30,420 --> 01:58:33,010
They discover a treasure chest!

3533
01:58:30,460 --> 01:58:31,160
Damn it's huge!

3534
01:58:33,010 --> 01:58:35,180
Hosei-san, can you open it?

3535
01:58:33,460 --> 01:58:34,130
I found it!

3536
01:58:35,180 --> 01:58:35,460
Come, guys!

3537
01:58:35,460 --> 01:58:36,460
I said get over here!

3538
01:58:36,460 --> 01:58:38,230
Get over  here, guys!

3539
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:37,930
Hosei-san, you open it

3540
01:58:38,230 --> 01:58:40,880
What are you guys doing?

3541
01:58:39,430 --> 01:58:40,950
If you could just bring the key over

3542
01:58:41,620 --> 01:58:43,840
The room's tiny, we can't all get in

3543
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:45,770
What are you talking about? There's plenty of space

3544
01:58:45,220 --> 01:58:47,040
No, we can't

3545
01:58:45,770 --> 01:58:49,260
Cookie can't come in with me

3546
01:58:47,110 --> 01:58:48,840
You've decided on Cookie as its name?

3547
01:58:49,110 --> 01:58:50,610
You can get in, right?

3548
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:51,660
Tanaka? What's wrong?

3549
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:52,130
I don't get it...

3550
01:58:51,660 --> 01:58:54,160
Tanaka? What's wrong?

3551
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:58,450
What's going on?

3552
01:58:58,450 --> 01:59:01,440
So many things are happening...

3553
01:59:02,610 --> 01:59:03,540
Hold on a minute!

3554
01:59:04,210 --> 01:59:05,510
What the hell is this?

3555
01:59:05,510 --> 01:59:07,980
I was trying to get Cookie to feature in this part...

3556
01:59:07,980 --> 01:59:11,550
But I can't if there's 3...

3557
01:59:11,560 --> 01:59:17,690
They've found a key!

3558
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:12,820
I found it!

3559
01:59:13,170 --> 01:59:14,880
They've finally found the key!

3560
01:59:15,350 --> 01:59:17,040
They hurry to Matsumoto

3561
01:59:17,690 --> 01:59:19,820
Matsumoto-san!

3562
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:23,590
What the hell, he's got a parasol?

3563
01:59:24,180 --> 01:59:25,360
Seriously...

3564
01:59:25,480 --> 01:59:26,110
We found the key

3565
01:59:26,060 --> 01:59:27,660
No, seriously...

3566
01:59:27,660 --> 01:59:31,070
It's SO DAMN HOT in here!

3567
01:59:29,850 --> 01:59:30,820
Oh, I see

3568
01:59:31,070 --> 01:59:33,470
How is it, Hiromi?

3569
01:59:32,070 --> 01:59:32,990
I'm counting on you, Hiromi!

3570
01:59:33,640 --> 01:59:34,590
Oh, does it not open?

3571
01:59:33,650 --> 01:59:34,790
Does it not open?

3572
01:59:34,690 --> 01:59:36,340
It opened, great... Thank you!

3573
01:59:37,110 --> 01:59:39,010
No good...

3574
01:59:39,030 --> 01:59:42,910
Punishment for Matsumoto

3575
01:59:39,060 --> 01:59:39,660
Sorry about that!

3576
01:59:40,030 --> 01:59:40,540
Sorry, man

3577
01:59:41,830 --> 01:59:42,480
Here she comes...

3578
01:59:43,310 --> 01:59:45,450
I wonder who's going to come out...

3579
01:59:45,450 --> 01:59:47,520
Oh, it's Obachan...

3580
01:59:47,670 --> 02:00:06,950
Obachan

3581
01:59:47,750 --> 01:59:48,500
It's Obachan

3582
01:59:48,620 --> 01:59:49,950
It's Obachan

3583
01:59:50,170 --> 01:59:51,370
She really is a Obachan...

3584
01:59:51,140 --> 01:59:51,960
You're right

3585
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:52,420
Obachan...

3586
01:59:52,790 --> 01:59:54,640
It wouldn't be weird if she was sick of this...

3587
01:59:55,240 --> 01:59:57,890
Damn, her hair is shiny

3588
01:59:56,830 --> 01:59:58,490
However you look at it, it's her...

3589
01:59:59,730 --> 02:00:02,130
It's cut so short...

3590
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:17,630
Obachan

3591
02:00:08,420 --> 02:00:11,260
OW!!!

3592
02:00:11,260 --> 02:00:14,060
He got electrocuted...

3593
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:17,630
His punishment is getting electrocuted

3594
02:00:14,190 --> 02:00:15,750
She's able to electrocute people now...

3595
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:17,630
Damn that hurt!

3596
02:00:17,900 --> 02:00:20,300
She's an Electric Catfish...

3597
02:00:20,300 --> 02:00:21,300
Did you get electrocuted?

3598
02:00:21,600 --> 02:00:23,040
It properly electrocuted me!!

3599
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:25,470
That Obachan is evolving too...

3600
02:00:25,470 --> 02:00:27,010
Let's go look for it...

3601
02:00:27,010 --> 02:00:29,780
We got to look in the school

3602
02:00:30,080 --> 02:00:34,780
They split up and search

3603
02:00:30,340 --> 02:00:31,590
I will look over here

3604
02:00:31,310 --> 02:00:32,710
Ok

3605
02:00:32,910 --> 02:00:34,780
Let's look again...

3606
02:00:38,720 --> 02:00:41,040
Oh shi-!...

3607
02:00:41,040 --> 02:00:42,160
It's just my dog...

3608
02:00:42,160 --> 02:00:46,590
Hamada gets scared by Cookie

3609
02:00:46,890 --> 02:00:48,900
This came up from below...

3610
02:00:48,900 --> 02:00:50,300
That was so scary just now...

3611
02:00:50,950 --> 02:00:52,800
It's Cookie...

3612
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:55,470
He got scared of Cookie...

3613
02:00:55,100 --> 02:00:56,120
He's properly looking at you...

3614
02:00:56,950 --> 02:00:58,050
You're really dirty

3615
02:00:59,570 --> 02:01:01,840
30 minutes have passed

3616
02:01:01,940 --> 02:01:05,750
Increasing the number of Oni

3617
02:01:02,140 --> 02:01:05,750
More Oni Appear

3618
02:01:06,210 --> 02:01:10,580
They search the grounds

3619
02:01:07,350 --> 02:01:10,530
The five search the grounds once again

3620
02:01:13,400 --> 02:01:16,090
SHIT!!

3621
02:01:14,940 --> 02:01:16,090
Oh man that was scary!

3622
02:01:16,790 --> 02:01:18,590
You're kidding me, what?

3623
02:01:18,590 --> 02:01:19,960
Like when did he...?

3624
02:01:19,960 --> 02:01:22,760
I have no idea

3625
02:01:20,110 --> 02:01:23,410
This year, they would just suddenly appear

3626
02:01:24,150 --> 02:01:26,830
What the hell is "Sanadamaru"?!

3627
02:01:26,150 --> 02:03:05,900
Sanadamaru

3628
02:01:26,220 --> 02:01:26,950
Apparently it says "Sanadamaru"...

3629
02:01:27,850 --> 02:01:29,140
What is this?

3630
02:01:29,400 --> 02:01:30,240
Wait, what? Where are we going?

3631
02:01:30,240 --> 02:01:32,070
Wait, what? Where are we going?

3632
02:01:32,240 --> 02:01:34,310
He's been taken somewhere...

3633
02:01:34,310 --> 02:01:36,040
Where the hell are you taking him?!

3634
02:01:36,040 --> 02:01:37,430
What? The gym?

3635
02:01:37,580 --> 02:01:38,480
Tanaka? Are you okay?

3636
02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:40,700
Tanaka? Are you okay?

3637
02:01:39,530 --> 02:01:40,700
What the hell is this?

3638
02:01:40,700 --> 02:01:42,820
What is this?

3639
02:01:43,030 --> 02:01:45,020
Wait a second, what?

3640
02:01:46,720 --> 02:01:47,750
Oh shit, this...

3641
02:01:48,390 --> 02:01:51,010
It's just the Triangular Wooden Horse

3642
02:01:51,240 --> 02:01:53,230
I guess he's riding it...

3643
02:01:52,290 --> 02:01:53,230
Yeah I see...

3644
02:01:53,230 --> 02:01:55,900
It's triangular...

3645
02:01:53,240 --> 02:01:58,200
He gets up on the triangular wooden horse

3646
02:01:58,670 --> 02:02:00,200
Even the armour!

3647
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:03,240
They're putting such heavy things on him

3648
02:02:03,670 --> 02:02:04,770
He really looks a part ofthe Sengoku Division

3649
02:02:04,770 --> 02:02:06,510
He really looks a part of the Sengoku Division

3650
02:02:06,510 --> 02:02:10,110
The makeup kind of suits this...

3651
02:02:10,110 --> 02:02:12,280
They're really being mean to him

3652
02:02:12,260 --> 02:02:15,280
These guys are so rough...

3653
02:02:13,550 --> 02:02:14,300
It hurts, this hurts...

3654
02:02:14,300 --> 02:02:15,450
It hurts, this hurts

3655
02:02:15,450 --> 02:02:17,720
The pain is just about to start...

3656
02:02:16,300 --> 02:02:17,720
So true

3657
02:02:18,120 --> 02:02:20,120
This looks bad, man

3658
02:02:18,120 --> 02:02:20,990
He looks like a military commander, with his little dog behind...

3659
02:02:20,990 --> 02:02:22,820
Ow!!!

3660
02:02:23,220 --> 02:02:24,710
It hurts!!

3661
02:02:25,390 --> 02:02:26,290
OW!

3662
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:31,050
Sanadamaru departs

3663
02:02:28,310 --> 02:02:30,630
Ouch, this has to hurt

3664
02:02:32,230 --> 02:02:32,630
Wait, hold on, wait

3665
02:02:32,630 --> 02:02:33,030
Wait, hold on, wait

3666
02:02:33,030 --> 02:02:33,170
Ow ow ow!

3667
02:02:33,170 --> 02:02:33,270
Ow ow ow!

3668
02:02:33,270 --> 02:02:34,220
Ow ow ow!

3669
02:02:34,220 --> 02:02:35,500
IT HURTS!!

3670
02:02:35,500 --> 02:02:37,390
it hurts!!

3671
02:02:42,680 --> 02:02:44,430
Wait a second, wait!

3672
02:02:44,430 --> 02:02:47,450
OW OW OW!

3673
02:02:48,150 --> 02:02:53,790
It hurts!!!

3674
02:02:53,790 --> 02:02:55,150
Wait a minute!!

3675
02:02:55,150 --> 02:02:56,390
Please stop it!

3676
02:02:56,390 --> 02:02:57,760
IT HURTS!!

3677
02:03:01,560 --> 02:03:03,500
This is hell

3678
02:03:05,900 --> 02:03:08,770
It hurts

3679
02:03:09,640 --> 02:03:11,470
This is a Middle Ages torture device...

3680
02:03:11,650 --> 02:03:13,460
They've had this since a long time ago...

3681
02:03:14,110 --> 02:03:15,010
How was it?

3682
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:16,380
It hurt so bad...

3683
02:03:16,490 --> 02:03:17,410
This would hurt

3684
02:03:17,510 --> 02:03:19,460
It was the worst

3685
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:21,300
They did the same thing over and over...

3686
02:03:22,530 --> 02:03:39,000
Resentment of Age

3687
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:26,550
Resentment of age?!

3688
02:03:30,220 --> 02:03:33,230
Hiromi-san got caught!

3689
02:03:33,940 --> 02:03:34,630
Hiromi-san!

3690
02:03:34,630 --> 02:03:36,100
Why me?!

3691
02:03:36,230 --> 02:03:37,550
This sounds scary

3692
02:03:37,550 --> 02:03:39,000
The title scares me

3693
02:03:39,300 --> 02:03:46,570
Resentment of Age

3694
02:03:40,870 --> 02:03:42,900
What?

3695
02:03:42,120 --> 02:03:42,900
This is scary

3696
02:03:43,140 --> 02:03:43,640
This is kind of scary, Hiromi-san

3697
02:03:43,640 --> 02:03:46,570
This is kind of scary, Hiromi-san

3698
02:03:44,890 --> 02:03:46,520
It is the resentment of age, after all...

3699
02:03:46,570 --> 02:03:49,140
I don't like this being banged down stuff...

3700
02:03:49,140 --> 02:03:50,310
OH MY GOD!!

3701
02:03:50,310 --> 02:03:56,980
David Ito

3702
02:03:50,310 --> 02:03:56,980
Mister Chin

3703
02:03:50,310 --> 02:03:56,980
Resentment of Age Oni

3704
02:03:50,310 --> 02:03:56,980
Resentment of Age Oni

3705
02:03:56,980 --> 02:03:58,220
This is amazing!

3706
02:03:56,980 --> 02:05:25,770
Resentment of Age

3707
02:04:00,990 --> 02:04:02,490
I'm so happy!

3708
02:04:02,490 --> 02:04:03,890
It's B21!

3709
02:04:03,870 --> 02:04:05,660
It's B21!

3710
02:04:06,130 --> 02:04:08,930
Hehehehe...

3711
02:04:08,950 --> 02:04:13,400
B21 Special

3712
02:04:08,950 --> 02:04:13,400
B21 Special Full Line-Up!

3713
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:10,000
This is amazing!

3714
02:04:15,100 --> 02:04:17,040
"This year is our 30th Anniversary so let's do a Konto"

3715
02:04:17,040 --> 02:04:18,340
"This year is our 30th Anniversary so let's do a Konto"

3716
02:04:18,340 --> 02:04:19,440
"This year is our 30th Anniversary so let's do a Konto"

3717
02:04:19,440 --> 02:04:22,040
You kept saying it passionately

3718
02:04:22,040 --> 02:04:25,310
Yet you haven't contacted me once about it, you shit!

3719
02:04:25,310 --> 02:04:27,500
All you're thinking about is your renovation

3720
02:04:27,500 --> 02:04:28,710
Instead, think up some skits for us!!

3721
02:04:28,710 --> 02:04:30,380
Instead, think up some skits for us!!

3722
02:04:30,870 --> 02:04:33,590
I guess you were in the wrong for that one...

3723
02:04:33,590 --> 02:04:35,990
When we debuted, you said...

3724
02:04:35,990 --> 02:04:37,060
"Whatever happens, don't talk to Downtown or Unnan," didn't you?!

3725
02:04:37,060 --> 02:04:37,860
"Whatever happens, don't talk to Downtown or Unnan," didn't you?!

3726
02:04:37,860 --> 02:04:40,860
"Whatever happens, don't talk to Downtown or Unnan," didnt you?!

3727
02:04:40,860 --> 02:04:42,630
And despite saying that,you spoke to them secretly

3728
02:04:42,630 --> 02:04:44,430
And despite saying that, you spoke to them secretly

3729
02:04:44,430 --> 02:04:45,330
that you're such good friends, you're even on their bloody show now!

3730
02:04:45,330 --> 02:04:48,170
that you're such good friends, you're even on their bloody show now!

3731
02:04:48,170 --> 02:04:50,270
You did such a thing?!

3732
02:04:50,270 --> 02:04:52,840
He was quite nasty!

3733
02:04:51,390 --> 02:04:52,840
He was

3734
02:04:52,390 --> 02:04:52,840
Yeah!

3735
02:04:52,870 --> 02:04:55,160
At the Kabukicho Show House....

3736
02:04:55,160 --> 02:04:56,880
We met at the Oscars and for 32 years,

3737
02:04:56,880 --> 02:04:58,740
We met at the Oscars and for 32 years,

3738
02:04:58,740 --> 02:04:59,650
I always had financial difficulty...

3739
02:04:59,650 --> 02:05:01,750
I always had financial difficulty...

3740
02:05:01,750 --> 02:05:03,280
During our induction era, the money us 3 made

3741
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:04,850
During our induction era, the money us 3 made

3742
02:05:04,850 --> 02:05:07,990
why did most of that go to you..?

3743
02:05:07,990 --> 02:05:12,830
The share was2:2:6

3744
02:05:12,830 --> 02:05:14,030
The share was 2: 2:6

3745
02:05:14,030 --> 02:05:14,930
The share was 2:2:6

3746
02:05:14,930 --> 02:05:15,830
The share was 2:2:6

3747
02:05:15,830 --> 02:05:19,330
Don't take 60% of the money!!

3748
02:05:22,570 --> 02:05:25,770
Thank you very much!

3749
02:05:26,940 --> 02:05:29,210
Great work, guys!!

3750
02:05:29,210 --> 02:05:33,310
Only Debi-chin can say stuff like that...

3751
02:05:33,310 --> 02:05:36,780
I was able to witness something fantastic...

3752
02:05:36,780 --> 02:05:37,670
You know,80% of their hatred was from 30 years ago...

3753
02:05:37,670 --> 02:05:38,950
You know, 80% of their hatred was from 30 years ago...

3754
02:05:38,950 --> 02:05:41,440
You know, 80% of their hatred was from 30 years ago...

3755
02:05:41,440 --> 02:05:42,960
From when you were a nasty bastard...

3756
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:44,310
Was that true though?The "Don't talk to them" story?

3757
02:05:44,310 --> 02:05:45,260
Was that true though? The "Don't talk to them" story?

3758
02:05:45,260 --> 02:05:47,130
"Don't talk to Downtown or Unnan"...

3759
02:05:47,130 --> 02:05:48,380
Yeah...

3760
02:05:49,400 --> 02:05:51,050
But the truth is since ages ago,we did stuff together

3761
02:05:51,050 --> 02:05:52,730
But the truth is, since ages agowe did stuff together

3762
02:05:52,730 --> 02:05:53,400
But the truth is, since ages ago, we did stuff together

3763
02:05:53,400 --> 02:05:55,270
But the truth is, since ages ago, we did stuff together

3764
02:05:55,270 --> 02:05:57,070
But you told them not to talk to him..?

3765
02:05:57,070 --> 02:05:59,710
Whilst he said that, he would come over to mine...

3766
02:05:59,710 --> 02:06:04,010
I did go to his house and told those two not to speak to Downtown...

3767
02:06:04,010 --> 02:06:08,000
Of course they would hate you for that...

3768
02:06:08,050 --> 02:06:11,330
Oh well, they said all these other things...

3769
02:06:12,370 --> 02:06:15,390
Hamada notices an Oni...

3770
02:06:14,750 --> 02:06:15,590
He's realised

3771
02:06:15,620 --> 02:06:18,160
They're quite bad themselves too

3772
02:06:18,860 --> 02:06:20,510
They did say themselves too you'd do a live show

3773
02:06:21,030 --> 02:06:23,900
We'd be so happy if you did

3774
02:06:24,550 --> 02:06:25,920
I would love to see that

3775
02:06:26,120 --> 02:06:26,750
Live?

3776
02:06:26,820 --> 02:06:29,200
Yeah we'd love it

3777
02:06:30,850 --> 02:06:31,720
Seriously...

3778
02:06:32,270 --> 02:06:33,540
Yeah...

3779
02:06:36,140 --> 02:06:38,510
Damn man, that's annoying

3780
02:06:38,510 --> 02:06:40,050
Everyone saw him a bit, right?

3781
02:06:40,050 --> 02:06:41,700
Everyone saw him a bit, right?

3782
02:06:44,050 --> 02:06:46,950
What did it say on it?

3783
02:06:47,220 --> 02:06:49,490
"Hama no Bancho"

3784
02:06:48,320 --> 02:07:58,110
Hama no Bancho

3785
02:06:51,410 --> 02:06:52,910
Surely not...

3786
02:06:55,390 --> 02:06:56,400
IT'S THE REAL ONE!!!

3787
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:02,940
Please throw a hard one straight at his face!

3788
02:07:02,940 --> 02:07:06,040
Please throw a hard one straight at his face!

3789
02:07:05,120 --> 02:07:06,040
I'd die!!!

3790
02:07:06,040 --> 02:07:08,840
"Hama no Bancho" Oni (Was his nickname during his career)

3791
02:07:06,040 --> 02:07:08,840
Miura Daisuke

3792
02:07:09,010 --> 02:07:10,440
It's Hama no Bancho!

3793
02:07:10,440 --> 02:07:11,610
Great job!

3794
02:07:11,910 --> 02:07:13,650
He's retired now and all

3795
02:07:13,650 --> 02:07:17,080
Great work

3796
02:07:21,120 --> 02:07:22,590
Wait, hold on a minute

3797
02:07:22,610 --> 02:07:27,390
Hama no Bancho straight throw...

3798
02:07:22,690 --> 02:07:23,740
Wait wait...

3799
02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:24,910
This will hurt so bad...

3800
02:07:25,680 --> 02:07:27,390
Wait, I'm so scared!!!

3801
02:07:26,410 --> 02:07:27,360
He could die...

3802
02:07:27,780 --> 02:07:28,930
Endo!!

3803
02:07:29,380 --> 02:07:31,750
This would be terrifying!

3804
02:07:31,910 --> 02:07:34,180
Let's get him to throw a couple

3805
02:07:40,340 --> 02:07:43,380
As you'd expect!

3806
02:07:43,380 --> 02:07:45,880
That was right in the middle!

3807
02:07:43,790 --> 02:07:45,880
He really can aim and hit, huh..?

3808
02:07:54,990 --> 02:07:58,110
Bancho, thank you!

3809
02:07:58,110 --> 02:07:59,060
He just casually came out and casually hit him...

3810
02:07:59,060 --> 02:08:01,630
He just casually came out and casually hit him...

3811
02:08:03,180 --> 02:08:08,620
40 minutes have passed, increasing the numbers of Oni

3812
02:08:05,670 --> 02:08:08,620
More Oni appear

3813
02:08:08,770 --> 02:08:09,970
Hey!

3814
02:08:09,970 --> 02:08:11,970
We've found it!

3815
02:08:10,650 --> 02:08:11,920
Was there one there before..?

3816
02:08:11,970 --> 02:08:14,660
No way in hell was it there before...

3817
02:08:12,370 --> 02:08:15,510
Treasure Chest Located!

3818
02:08:13,560 --> 02:08:15,510
Just came out of nowhere...

3819
02:08:15,980 --> 02:08:17,780
Great going, Cookie

3820
02:08:16,910 --> 02:08:17,780
No, no...

3821
02:08:17,780 --> 02:08:19,110
I'm opening it...

3822
02:08:26,520 --> 02:10:07,020
Egashira

3823
02:08:33,580 --> 02:08:35,760
RIGHT!!

3824
02:08:35,760 --> 02:08:37,930
I'm here!!!!

3825
02:08:38,100 --> 02:08:40,570
Again...

3826
02:08:38,800 --> 02:08:40,800
He's come out again this year!

3827
02:08:41,230 --> 02:08:42,420
It's Hamada-san again!

3828
02:08:43,440 --> 02:08:45,710
BRING THAT IN!!

3829
02:08:45,990 --> 02:08:48,190
Ega-chan, what's your problem, man!?

3830
02:08:47,370 --> 02:08:49,580
This is bad, Hamada-san!

3831
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:49,580
This is really bad

3832
02:08:49,640 --> 02:08:51,360
I got Ega-chan last year as well!

3833
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:53,000
Egashira-san is bad, man...

3834
02:08:52,530 --> 02:08:54,980
He's come to get you again

3835
02:08:53,180 --> 02:08:54,350
What's this?

3836
02:08:54,350 --> 02:08:56,880
Do it!!

3837
02:08:55,800 --> 02:08:56,880
Wait, what?!

3838
02:08:57,220 --> 02:08:58,100
This is bad

3839
02:08:59,420 --> 02:09:02,320
Isn't this really bad?

3840
02:09:00,550 --> 02:09:02,320
I knew he'd appear at some point...

3841
02:09:03,990 --> 02:09:06,530
Ega-chan, what is with this?

3842
02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:09,360
This is serious, like genuinely bad

3843
02:09:09,360 --> 02:09:11,130
This is serious, like genuinely bad

3844
02:09:10,380 --> 02:09:11,130
What is it?

3845
02:09:11,130 --> 02:09:13,130
This is bad, real bad

3846
02:09:13,330 --> 02:09:14,870
The Once-A-Year Ega-chan festival!

3847
02:09:14,870 --> 02:09:16,300
The Once-A-Year Ega-chan festival!

3848
02:09:16,300 --> 02:09:17,600
I've become one with Hama-chan now!

3849
02:09:17,600 --> 02:09:20,410
I've become one with Hama-chan now!

3850
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:21,390
What the hell?!

3851
02:09:22,060 --> 02:09:25,030
The Demon's Shriek

3852
02:09:22,910 --> 02:09:24,910
Man, this is scary

3853
02:09:29,820 --> 02:09:32,250
He's so up for it!

3854
02:09:34,940 --> 02:09:37,520
Rubber Tube of an Automobile Explosion

3855
02:09:37,570 --> 02:09:39,110
That's a tube, right..?

3856
02:09:38,710 --> 02:09:39,110
Yes

3857
02:09:39,230 --> 02:09:40,360
This is bad

3858
02:09:40,890 --> 02:09:41,230
This is bad, real bad.

3859
02:09:41,230 --> 02:09:42,500
This is bad, real bad

3860
02:09:47,850 --> 02:09:49,920
What the hell you mean "Ega-chan"..?

3861
02:09:57,340 --> 02:09:58,330
He's getting tired!

3862
02:09:58,530 --> 02:09:59,510
Hama-chan, Ega-chan

3863
02:09:59,510 --> 02:10:00,510
Hama-chan, Ega-chan

3864
02:10:00,510 --> 02:10:01,500
Hama-chan, Ega-chan

3865
02:10:01,500 --> 02:10:02,350
Hama-chan, Ega-chan

3866
02:10:04,280 --> 02:10:06,070
I'm so scared!

3867
02:10:08,040 --> 02:10:10,490
Here it comes!

3868
02:10:08,090 --> 02:10:10,320
Oh shit!

3869
02:10:10,490 --> 02:10:12,260
Please stop!

3870
02:10:13,860 --> 02:10:14,790
Please stop!

3871
02:10:15,160 --> 02:10:16,050
Ow!!!

3872
02:10:16,930 --> 02:10:18,930
He hit his head on the floor!

3873
02:10:17,930 --> 02:10:20,170
Hehehehehe...

3874
02:10:20,850 --> 02:10:24,120
Matsumoto quietly laughs

3875
02:10:24,120 --> 02:10:26,760
Hama-chan, see you next year

3876
02:10:26,760 --> 02:10:28,920
Hey, I got to get to work!

3877
02:10:28,920 --> 02:10:30,930
Get out my way, goddamn it!

3878
02:10:33,200 --> 02:10:35,150
So he came this year, after all

3879
02:10:35,150 --> 02:10:36,130
Hey guys

3880
02:10:36,130 --> 02:10:38,270
Because of what just happened, Cookie disappeared

3881
02:10:39,350 --> 02:10:42,020
COOKIE!!!

3882
02:10:40,270 --> 02:10:41,320
HEY COOKIE!

3883
02:10:42,820 --> 02:10:43,520
COOKIE!

3884
02:10:43,970 --> 02:10:45,240
COOKIE!

3885
02:10:45,240 --> 02:10:46,560
He's such a fricking idiot

3886
02:10:46,560 --> 02:10:48,560
He was the most shocked out of all of us

3887
02:10:49,980 --> 02:10:50,960
Hey, look!

3888
02:10:50,300 --> 02:10:56,620
Key discovered!

3889
02:10:51,060 --> 02:10:56,120
Finally they find a 2nd key; will they be able to get Matsumoto out this time?

3890
02:10:56,570 --> 02:10:57,500
Sorry sorry sorry!

3891
02:10:57,840 --> 02:10:58,890
Seriously, enough

3892
02:10:58,520 --> 02:10:59,590
Here I go

3893
02:10:59,590 --> 02:11:00,460
How is it?

3894
02:11:00,760 --> 02:11:02,260
Please just...

3895
02:11:02,260 --> 02:11:04,260
For crying out loud

3896
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:05,310
Matsumoto gets punished

3897
02:11:04,610 --> 02:11:06,910
Are you putting the key in properly?

3898
02:11:07,700 --> 02:11:09,080
Oh damn

3899
02:11:11,650 --> 02:11:13,250
It's that "I can walk now" skit

3900
02:11:15,520 --> 02:11:17,360
That "I can walk now" skit

3901
02:11:18,720 --> 02:11:19,780
He keeps coming out

3902
02:11:19,780 --> 02:11:20,710
Why the hell does he come out here?

3903
02:11:20,390 --> 02:11:25,100
I can make you go numb now...

3904
02:11:22,380 --> 02:11:23,410
There it is...

3905
02:11:23,910 --> 02:11:24,900
He said it

3906
02:11:25,610 --> 02:11:29,620
He always says some crap like that

3907
02:11:27,780 --> 02:11:31,820
I am electrostatic right now

3908
02:11:31,720 --> 02:11:33,290
No no no no, no way

3909
02:11:33,290 --> 02:11:38,480
So I can make you go numb now

3910
02:11:34,570 --> 02:11:36,810
No no, I'm scared!

3911
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:38,460
It's kind of scary...

3912
02:11:38,460 --> 02:11:40,460
No seriously, please.

3913
02:11:40,460 --> 02:11:42,450
Man that's scary

3914
02:11:42,480 --> 02:11:44,320
If he did that to me, I'd be scared

3915
02:11:43,350 --> 02:11:44,330
Shit, I'm really scared

3916
02:11:45,890 --> 02:11:48,340
AGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

3917
02:11:48,340 --> 02:11:50,340
AGGHHHHH!!!!!

3918
02:11:50,340 --> 02:11:52,340
Oh it hurts Kinoshita as well

3919
02:11:52,340 --> 02:11:54,340
There must have been a huge discharge there

3920
02:11:54,340 --> 02:11:57,010
That was strong

3921
02:11:57,010 --> 02:11:57,830
Before was the Obachan

3922
02:11:57,830 --> 02:11:58,830
That's true

3923
02:11:59,850 --> 02:12:00,600
It must have been bad.

3924
02:12:04,650 --> 02:12:08,170
I can do it again...

3925
02:12:08,740 --> 02:12:10,260
No no no

3926
02:12:12,750 --> 02:12:16,430
AAGHHHH!!!!!

3927
02:12:17,080 --> 02:12:18,420
Kinoshita gets more damage!

3928
02:12:19,290 --> 02:12:20,450
Here I come again!

3929
02:12:23,560 --> 02:12:26,610
THAT'S ENOUGH!!

3930
02:12:26,610 --> 02:12:28,610
I'm doing it once more!

3931
02:12:32,600 --> 02:12:35,420
AGGGHHHHH!!!!

3932
02:12:35,420 --> 02:12:37,800
What the hell, man

3933
02:12:37,800 --> 02:12:39,070
What's he doing?

3934
02:12:43,360 --> 02:12:47,880
50 minutes passed. Increasing number of Oni.

3935
02:12:46,010 --> 02:12:48,600
More Oni come out

3936
02:12:48,650 --> 02:12:51,920
Here comes one

3937
02:12:53,320 --> 02:12:54,550
No way in hell...

3938
02:12:59,260 --> 02:13:00,740
NO WAY!!

3939
02:13:00,740 --> 02:13:02,750
YOU'RE KIDDING ME!!

3940
02:13:02,760 --> 02:13:04,750
YOU'RE KIDDING ME!! Give me a second!

3941
02:13:04,750 --> 02:13:06,750
Hold on a minute...

3942
02:13:05,510 --> 02:13:06,430
They got Hosei-san!

3943
02:13:06,430 --> 02:13:08,570
I thought he'd go for Hiromi-san

3944
02:13:09,200 --> 02:13:10,050
Me?

3945
02:13:10,690 --> 02:13:12,200
I thought he had locked on to me

3946
02:13:12,400 --> 02:13:15,620
Monster Truck?

3947
02:13:13,390 --> 02:13:14,670
Monster Truck?

3948
02:13:13,820 --> 02:13:15,040
Hold on a second

3949
02:13:16,680 --> 02:13:17,280
What...

3950
02:13:18,930 --> 02:13:19,900
I just stand here?

3951
02:13:23,250 --> 02:13:26,990
I can hear the sound of a monster...

3952
02:13:27,590 --> 02:13:30,010
Wow, listen to that!

3953
02:13:30,010 --> 02:13:33,010
What the hell is that?!

3954
02:13:33,940 --> 02:13:35,890
This is so bad

3955
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:40,450
This is awful

3956
02:13:42,270 --> 02:13:44,120
What the hell is this?

3957
02:13:44,120 --> 02:13:48,490
If you look at those tires, that thing is going to move around like hell, I bet...

3958
02:13:47,320 --> 02:13:48,490
You're right

3959
02:13:50,980 --> 02:13:53,530
But you know, Yama-chan, this might be kind of fun

3960
02:13:53,550 --> 02:13:56,430
Like a ride of some sort

3961
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:55,280
That's true

3962
02:13:56,470 --> 02:13:58,100
You wouldn't normally be able to experience something like this

3963
02:13:59,920 --> 02:14:01,300
Yama-chan, be careful, okay?

3964
02:14:01,300 --> 02:14:02,120
Do your best

3965
02:14:02,820 --> 02:14:05,620
What kind of face you making..?

3966
02:14:03,640 --> 02:14:04,170
His neck!

3967
02:14:22,160 --> 02:14:23,040
Damn, that's scary

3968
02:14:23,040 --> 02:14:25,580
Yama-chan, we can't hear your screams at all...

3969
02:14:28,780 --> 02:14:31,080
Oh damn!

3970
02:14:41,240 --> 02:14:42,850
I wonder if they're going to jump that at the end

3971
02:14:43,760 --> 02:14:45,030
Oh damn, this is bad

3972
02:14:57,730 --> 02:15:02,330
BRAVO

3973
02:14:58,040 --> 02:14:58,910
Here he comes

3974
02:15:01,910 --> 02:15:03,250
That was amazing

3975
02:15:03,380 --> 02:15:06,370
The first part looked kind of fun, to be honest...

3976
02:15:08,190 --> 02:15:10,410
It was like the heavens and earth flipped over or something

3977
02:15:10,410 --> 02:15:12,840
I've never experienced that kind of thing

3978
02:15:11,170 --> 02:15:12,360
You could only see the sky?

3979
02:15:12,810 --> 02:15:14,330
It's not just I could only see the sky

3980
02:15:14,560 --> 02:15:17,780
But like everything flipped over.

3981
02:15:17,780 --> 02:15:20,920
Hey, Fujiwara-san is coming over here

3982
02:15:20,920 --> 02:15:23,050
Because you guys couldn't find the key at all

3983
02:15:24,540 --> 02:15:27,290
Can you just use this Master Key?

3984
02:15:27,290 --> 02:15:28,890
You had a Master Key all this time?

3985
02:15:28,890 --> 02:15:29,740
The Master Key?

3986
02:15:29,140 --> 02:15:36,600
Training Finished

3987
02:15:30,380 --> 02:15:33,630
Using the Master Key, they successfully get Matsumoto out.

3988
02:15:34,360 --> 02:15:35,430
And the training ended.

3989
02:15:36,650 --> 02:15:38,950
We still have lots to do so we're heading back

3990
02:15:38,950 --> 02:15:40,870
There's still more to do..?

3991
02:15:40,870 --> 02:15:46,810
3:30PM, back to the laboratory.

3992
02:15:43,070 --> 02:15:46,290
3:30PM, 7 hours 30 minutes since the start.

3993
02:15:46,290 --> 02:15:49,360
Of course, the five don't get a break

3994
02:15:50,500 --> 02:15:54,830
We're going to introduce ourselves to the chief now

3995
02:15:54,720 --> 02:15:55,880
The chief?

3996
02:15:56,050 --> 02:15:56,970
You laughed just now

3997
02:15:57,020 --> 02:15:57,890
He won't reply...

3998
02:15:59,560 --> 02:16:00,240
You just laughed just now

3999
02:16:00,240 --> 02:16:02,240
No, I was like "Ha-haaan"

4000
02:16:06,480 --> 02:16:07,650
That's laughing surely...

4001
02:16:07,330 --> 02:16:08,530
No, not at all

4002
02:16:08,530 --> 02:16:09,880
It was just like a "ha"...

4003
02:16:09,880 --> 02:16:11,870
Can you just line up here?

4004
02:16:11,870 --> 02:16:15,550
Hamada, Matsumoto, Endo, Tanaka, Hosei

4005
02:16:19,460 --> 02:16:21,090
Chief

4006
02:16:21,090 --> 02:16:22,930
These are the 5 newbies

4007
02:16:22,930 --> 02:16:25,260
who will be working here today

4008
02:16:25,260 --> 02:16:27,030

02:24:00,390 --> 02:24:01,590
This time, I'mScience

4191
02:24:01,590 --> 02:24:02,640
This time, I'm Science

4192
02:24:02,690 --> 02:24:04,690
Happy Booooy

4193
02:24:04,690 --> 02:24:05,360
Here it is

4194
02:24:05,360 --> 02:24:06,590
The left hand ofFleming's left hand rule!

4195
02:24:06,590 --> 02:24:09,230
The left hand of Fleming's left hand rule!

4196
02:24:10,680 --> 02:24:12,730
Thank you very much!

4197
02:24:12,730 --> 02:24:13,530
Everyone, I am definitely NOT an honorary professor!!

4198
02:24:13,530 --> 02:24:14,770
Everyone, I am definitely NOT an honorary professor!!

4199
02:24:14,770 --> 02:24:16,770
Everyone, I am definitely NOT an honorary professor!!

4200
02:24:16,770 --> 02:24:18,400
Everyone, I am definitely NOT an honorary professor!!

4201
02:24:18,400 --> 02:24:20,090
But I am more parasitic in character

4202
02:24:20,090 --> 02:24:21,210
But I am more parasitic in character

4203
02:24:21,240 --> 02:24:24,540
But I am more parastic in character

4204
02:24:24,540 --> 02:24:26,530
That's right!

4205
02:24:32,450 --> 02:24:34,650
What the hell!?

4206
02:24:34,650 --> 02:24:35,920
My apologies!

4207
02:24:37,560 --> 02:24:38,260
Since it's been two years since Happy Boy, I'm a little excited

4208
02:24:38,260 --> 02:24:39,820
Since it's been two years since Happy Boy, I'm a little excited

4209
02:24:39,820 --> 02:24:41,030
Since it's been two years since Happy Boy, I'm a little excited

4210
02:24:41,030 --> 02:24:45,430
It has been two years!

4211
02:24:41,480 --> 02:24:43,280
That's right

4212
02:24:46,280 --> 02:24:47,370
I am not an honorary professor

4213
02:24:47,370 --> 02:24:48,530
I am not an honorary professor

4214
02:24:48,530 --> 02:24:51,400
But an assistant to the honorary professor

4215
02:24:51,400 --> 02:24:52,470
Let me introduce the honorary professor

4216
02:24:52,470 --> 02:24:54,570
Let me introduce the honorary professor

4217
02:25:02,550 --> 02:25:05,120
I am your honorary professor

4218
02:25:05,220 --> 02:25:08,120
Honorary Professor

4219
02:25:05,220 --> 02:25:08,120
Kamikawa Takaya

4220
02:25:09,550 --> 02:25:10,720
So

4221
02:25:10,720 --> 02:25:11,860
Our very first Science quiz from us

4222
02:25:11,860 --> 02:25:14,030
Our very first Science quiz from us

4223
02:25:14,030 --> 02:25:14,860
Without further ado, let us check with an experiment

4224
02:25:14,860 --> 02:25:17,200
Without further ado, let us check with an experiment

4225
02:25:16,360 --> 02:25:17,600
Please

4226
02:25:17,600 --> 02:25:21,430
Here, we have a tank filled with oil

4227
02:25:22,400 --> 02:25:24,600
and a glass cup

4228
02:25:24,600 --> 02:25:26,590
If you could confirm for me

4229
02:25:27,440 --> 02:25:29,390
Yes, this is indeed glass

4230
02:25:30,040 --> 02:25:34,280
I will now drop this glass cup into the tank

4231
02:25:34,280 --> 02:25:35,410
Sink please sink

4232
02:25:35,410 --> 02:25:37,780
Sink please sink

4233
02:25:38,120 --> 02:25:39,120
What's gonna happen?

4234
02:25:42,390 --> 02:25:42,720
it's disappearing

4235
02:25:42,720 --> 02:25:43,820
it's disappearing

4236
02:25:44,920 --> 02:25:45,910
Wow!

4237
02:25:49,280 --> 02:25:51,560
IT DISAPPEARED

4238
02:25:51,960 --> 02:25:53,480
Eh!?

4239
02:25:52,600 --> 02:25:53,950
Wow!

4240
02:25:59,690 --> 02:26:01,610
While it hasn't actually disappeared

4241
02:26:02,210 --> 02:26:04,340
We still won't be able to see it from the side

4242
02:26:04,280 --> 02:26:05,710
It actually is

4243
02:26:04,510 --> 02:26:06,760
Ehhhhhh

4244
02:26:05,960 --> 02:26:07,230
right here

4245
02:26:07,680 --> 02:26:08,560
Amazing

4246
02:26:08,680 --> 02:26:10,150
This is...

4247
02:26:10,480 --> 02:26:12,520
Here's the rationale

4248
02:26:12,770 --> 02:26:17,160
The human will only see things by how light reflects them

4249
02:26:12,770 --> 02:26:18,010
The human eye can see things by reflecting certain lights

4250
02:26:12,770 --> 02:26:38,380
Honorary professor Kamikawa's explanation

4251
02:26:17,160 --> 02:26:25,000
When things "disappear", they're only blended in with other lights

4252
02:26:18,560 --> 02:26:26,000
When light cannot reflect the object, then it seems "invisible"

4253
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:30,400
So the refractive index for salad oil and glass is about the same

4254
02:26:26,560 --> 02:26:31,590
The refractive index for salad oil and glass is about the same

4255
02:26:30,400 --> 02:26:36,070
Which creates the visual effect of the two items assimilating and disappearing

4256
02:26:32,140 --> 02:26:38,380
The salad oil and glass will seem to diffuse due to this

4257
02:26:38,630 --> 02:26:42,200
INCORRECT

4258
02:26:43,050 --> 02:26:47,250
Launching the liquid nitrogen-propelled rocket punch!!

4259
02:26:51,090 --> 02:26:55,040
Young ones of the Denjiro Army, bring it in!

4260
02:26:51,090 --> 02:26:59,430
Ichioka Genki

4261
02:26:51,090 --> 02:26:59,430
Punishment provided by Denjiro Army

4262
02:26:55,560 --> 02:26:59,550
Next, we have been presented with this plastic bottle

4263
02:26:59,850 --> 02:27:02,630
On this plastic bottle, there is a boxing glove attached

4264
02:26:59,850 --> 02:27:07,660
Liquid nitrogen will be injected into the plastic bottle with the glove attached

4265
02:26:59,850 --> 02:27:25,810
Liquid Nitrogen Rocket Punch

4266
02:27:02,630 --> 02:27:06,790
We will be injecting liquid nitrogen into the bottle

4267
02:27:06,790 --> 02:27:10,360
At room temperature, liquid nitrogen is known to evaporate at an explosive rate

4268
02:27:08,210 --> 02:27:13,730
The liquid nitrogen will vaporize inside of the plastic bottle

4269
02:27:10,360 --> 02:27:13,360
The bottle will instantly propel itself

4270
02:27:13,360 --> 02:27:18,830
And when we have the greatest amount of force, we will pull this plug and see what happens

4271
02:27:14,280 --> 02:27:18,470
When the matter will reach its limit, the plug will be pulled

4272
02:27:18,870 --> 02:27:23,150
Then the bottle will turn into a rocket and fly towards the target

4273
02:27:19,020 --> 02:27:25,810
The bottle will fly towards the face with awesome momentum

4274
02:27:23,240 --> 02:27:23,920
This isn't good

4275
02:27:23,920 --> 02:27:25,120
So let's try it!

4276
02:27:24,870 --> 02:27:25,990
This is not good

4277
02:27:25,990 --> 02:27:27,440
Tanaka-san, if you will

4278
02:27:27,110 --> 02:27:27,910
Be careful!

4279
02:27:28,240 --> 02:27:30,630
Alright

4280
02:27:30,110 --> 02:27:31,880
No no no no

4281
02:27:30,710 --> 02:27:31,880
This is gonna hurt

4282
02:27:31,930 --> 02:27:35,330
"Containing the air, the cup will sink"

4283
02:27:35,330 --> 02:27:37,270
That was such a dumb answer

4284
02:27:37,470 --> 02:27:39,270
Excuse me

4285
02:27:39,470 --> 02:27:43,710
Equipping goggles to be safe

4286
02:27:39,920 --> 02:27:43,710
This experiment can be dangerous, so I will also be wearing goggles

4287
02:27:45,360 --> 02:27:46,860
The rest of you can relax and watch

4288
02:27:46,880 --> 02:27:47,410
It'll be fine

4289
02:27:47,410 --> 02:27:48,850
I am now injecting liquid nitrogen into the plastic bottle

4290
02:27:48,850 --> 02:27:51,280
I am now injecting liquid nitrogen into the plastic bottle

4291
02:27:52,550 --> 02:27:55,090
And here we see liquid nitrogen reacting at room temperature

4292
02:27:55,090 --> 02:27:56,590
The nitrogen is evaporating before our eyes as it turns into gas

4293
02:27:56,590 --> 02:27:58,660
The nitrogen is evaporating before our eyes as it turns into gas

4294
02:27:58,660 --> 02:28:00,060
The nitrogen is evaporating before our eyes as it turns into gas

4295
02:28:01,790 --> 02:28:06,480
Be careful and stand back...

4296
02:28:03,660 --> 02:28:05,950
I'm a little scared

4297
02:28:06,530 --> 02:28:08,070
Scary doesn't even come close to what this is

4298
02:28:06,710 --> 02:28:08,120
And here, we have the plug

4299
02:28:08,070 --> 02:28:10,100
Scary doesn't even come close to what this is

4300
02:28:08,430 --> 02:28:09,950
I'm so scared...

4301
02:28:10,100 --> 02:28:12,690
Happy Boy, I'm pretty scared

4302
02:28:12,790 --> 02:28:13,960
No way

4303
02:28:13,440 --> 02:28:14,040
It would probably be best not to move around, Tanaka-kun

4304
02:28:14,040 --> 02:28:16,260
It would probably be best not to move around, Tanaka-kun

4305
02:28:15,040 --> 02:28:16,260
It's just worse if you move!

4306
02:28:16,560 --> 02:28:18,260
It's dangerous so don't move

4307
02:28:17,990 --> 02:28:19,790
Prepare the string!

4308
02:28:20,360 --> 02:28:23,350
Time is of the essence here

4309
02:28:23,430 --> 02:28:30,690
Seconds until launch

4310
02:28:23,480 --> 02:28:25,230
We will now commence the countdown

4311
02:28:23,720 --> 02:28:25,550
This is horrifying!

4312
02:28:25,870 --> 02:28:27,240
Wait, wait!

4313
02:28:27,270 --> 02:28:30,920
3... 2...1...

4314
02:28:42,080 --> 02:28:43,920
It was so fast, I couldn't even see it!

4315
02:28:43,970 --> 02:28:45,000
Wait, wait, is his face okay?

4316
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:46,570
Wait, wait, is his face okay?

4317
02:28:46,570 --> 02:28:48,040
That was pretty bad

4318
02:28:48,520 --> 02:28:49,960
Tanakaaaa!!

4319
02:28:51,110 --> 02:28:53,080
That's not very "happy" of you!

4320
02:28:54,510 --> 02:28:57,120
Who knew you'd get bodied!?

4321
02:28:57,950 --> 02:28:59,120
IT'S A SCIENCE

4322
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:02,200
Let us depart!

4323
02:29:04,060 --> 02:29:05,190
Happy Boy!! That was so damn painful!

4324
02:29:05,190 --> 02:29:06,590
Happy Boy!! That was so damn painful!

4325
02:29:06,590 --> 02:29:07,160
UNHAPPY SEE YOU!!

4326
02:29:07,160 --> 02:29:09,330
UNHAPPY SEE YOU!!

4327
02:29:11,680 --> 02:29:13,080
There was just this loud "Goh Goh"

4328
02:29:12,160 --> 02:29:13,480
Yes

4329
02:29:13,080 --> 02:29:14,030
Yes

4330
02:29:13,510 --> 02:29:14,880
The sound from that was just unbelievable

4331
02:29:14,900 --> 02:29:16,130
I thought I could see it

4332
02:29:16,130 --> 02:29:18,100
I thought I could see it

4333
02:29:22,440 --> 02:29:23,110
Excuse me, I have a delivery

4334
02:29:23,110 --> 02:29:25,540
Excuse me, I have a delivery

4335
02:29:25,110 --> 02:29:27,110
I have a package for Matsumoto-san

4336
02:29:26,280 --> 02:29:29,200
A package for Mr. Matsumoto

4337
02:29:31,950 --> 02:29:32,520
If you could just sign this please

4338
02:29:32,520 --> 02:29:34,390
If you could just sign this please

4339
02:29:34,390 --> 02:29:37,390
Is this actually for me?

4340
02:29:35,120 --> 02:29:36,840
Here

4341
02:29:39,010 --> 02:29:41,030
Isn't it huge?

4342
02:29:41,080 --> 02:29:42,560
Thank you!

4343
02:29:42,660 --> 02:29:44,660
Let's look

4344
02:29:43,830 --> 02:29:44,880
Let's look

4345
02:29:44,630 --> 02:29:47,000
Now wait a second

4346
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:47,900
Things are happening so fast

4347
02:29:47,900 --> 02:29:49,570
All we do is open things and now I'm just scared

4348
02:29:49,570 --> 02:29:51,170
All we do is open things and now I'm just scared

4349
02:29:51,170 --> 02:29:52,550
This is huge!

4350
02:29:52,970 --> 02:29:55,640
That's a big parcel

4351
02:29:59,190 --> 02:30:01,200
What is this?

4352
02:30:01,830 --> 02:30:02,830
Eh?

4353
02:30:10,020 --> 02:30:12,890
Sexy chief comes out

4354
02:30:12,890 --> 02:30:15,560
The first and probably last

4355
02:30:15,940 --> 02:30:19,730
ragingly sexy actor!!

4356
02:30:19,730 --> 02:30:24,870
A man that loves sexy beings and a man loved by sexy beings!!

4357
02:30:24,870 --> 02:30:28,270
Cheating, affairs, double affairs

4358
02:30:28,270 --> 02:30:30,740
The perfect combo to be sexy

4359
02:30:30,740 --> 02:30:33,360
This is who we areee!!

4360
02:30:33,360 --> 02:30:39,850
Sunchine Sai-tou

4361
02:30:40,250 --> 02:30:42,920
YEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAY!!

4362
02:30:43,070 --> 02:30:43,550
Justice!!

4363
02:30:43,550 --> 02:30:44,520
Justice!!

4364
02:30:49,440 --> 02:30:51,300
What was that?

4365
02:30:50,340 --> 02:30:51,300
I don't get it.

4366
02:30:52,560 --> 02:30:54,570
I don't understand it.

4367
02:30:53,280 --> 02:30:54,800
This was sent to Matsumoto?

4368
02:30:54,850 --> 02:30:56,250
It came for me.

4369
02:30:54,850 --> 02:30:56,250
There is no end to this.

4370
02:30:59,900 --> 02:31:00,470
The chief sure has a lot of free time.

4371
02:31:00,470 --> 02:31:02,570
The chief sure has a lot of free time.

4372
02:31:02,570 --> 02:31:02,790
That's right!! He's the chief and all.

4373
02:31:02,790 --> 02:31:05,210
That's right!! He's the chief and all.

4374
02:31:05,290 --> 02:31:06,610
He's the chief of this entire place.

4375
02:31:07,660 --> 02:31:09,980
Should I open it?

4376
02:31:08,500 --> 02:31:09,950
What should we do?

4377
02:31:15,250 --> 02:31:16,550
Ah, you have a key.

4378
02:31:16,050 --> 02:31:20,430
Mysterious key #2

4379
02:31:18,570 --> 02:31:19,990
Should I open first?

4380
02:31:25,200 --> 02:31:27,270
Tanaka had a key.

4381
02:31:27,270 --> 02:31:29,100
Once again.

4382
02:31:28,020 --> 02:31:28,870
What?

4383
02:31:28,120 --> 02:31:28,870
What?

4384
02:31:28,980 --> 02:31:32,100
This is scary.

4385
02:31:29,450 --> 02:31:34,510
Mysterious box

4386
02:31:32,520 --> 02:31:34,690
Let's just get it out of the way.

4387
02:31:43,980 --> 02:31:47,350
Crying face mask

4388
02:31:48,390 --> 02:31:51,470
What is this thing?

4389
02:31:49,070 --> 02:31:50,250
I feel bad for it.

4390
02:31:53,540 --> 02:31:54,530
It's crying.

4391
02:31:58,700 --> 02:32:01,450
It surely is crying.

4392
02:32:01,630 --> 02:32:03,130
Anyway, try to wear it.

4393
02:32:03,170 --> 02:32:04,340
That's right.

4394
02:32:04,600 --> 02:32:06,390
Because earlier Tanaka...

4395
02:32:06,420 --> 02:32:07,590
This child is...

4396
02:32:07,660 --> 02:32:08,660
Yes, probably.

4397
02:32:09,390 --> 02:32:10,540
This child is here because...

4398
02:32:10,680 --> 02:32:12,590
Because of the teasing.

4399
02:32:12,810 --> 02:32:15,880
After the kick, his face also was so sad.

4400
02:32:17,250 --> 02:32:20,250
Ah, so that's it.

4401
02:32:24,420 --> 02:32:26,340
Why Tanaka, though?

4402
02:32:26,340 --> 02:32:29,030
Why Tanaka, though?

4403
02:32:35,070 --> 02:32:37,200
This is so dirty.

4404
02:32:41,070 --> 02:32:43,470
It looks so sad.

4405
02:32:48,210 --> 02:32:51,220
It's crying.

4406
02:32:49,880 --> 02:32:51,220
It is crying.

4407
02:32:51,650 --> 02:32:52,830
It's even looking down.

4408
02:32:55,890 --> 02:32:58,310
Stop it, you!

4409
02:32:58,310 --> 02:32:59,160
Looking down is no good.

4410
02:32:59,170 --> 02:33:02,640
This is no good.

4411
02:33:00,070 --> 02:33:02,690
Really. Looking down is too much.

4412
02:33:03,610 --> 02:33:05,980
That's no good.

4413
02:33:04,660 --> 02:33:07,620
I can see too much background story to this.

4414
02:33:08,020 --> 02:33:09,570
This is no good.

4415
02:33:08,730 --> 02:33:10,700
No good. No good.

4416
02:33:10,800 --> 02:33:14,470
Are you performing?

4417
02:33:12,070 --> 02:33:14,920
Stop it. Stop it.

4418
02:33:15,060 --> 02:33:16,890
We told you to stop.

4419
02:33:18,440 --> 02:33:20,440
Stop it!

4420
02:33:22,410 --> 02:33:24,730
Stop it.

4421
02:33:23,110 --> 02:33:24,730
This is so dirty of you.

4422
02:33:26,050 --> 02:33:26,780
Why is it you who receives such an item?

4423
02:33:26,780 --> 02:33:28,990
Why is it you who receives such an item?

4424
02:33:30,150 --> 02:33:31,470
Tanaka, it's no good if you sit like that.

4425
02:33:31,470 --> 02:33:33,470
Just wear it without doing anything.

4426
02:33:33,510 --> 02:33:35,440
Even just wearing it is too much.

4427
02:33:36,460 --> 02:33:38,460
What's wrong with you?

4428
02:33:42,170 --> 02:33:45,690
This is bad, plainly bad. Such a gloomy posture.

4429
02:33:46,190 --> 02:33:47,960
He's definitely laughing inside of it.

4430
02:33:48,220 --> 02:33:50,390
Tanaka, stop it.

4431
02:33:48,860 --> 02:33:50,390
This guy is definitely...

4432
02:33:50,390 --> 02:33:51,040
He's definitely laughing inside of it.

4433
02:33:51,040 --> 02:33:53,360
He's definitely laughing inside of it.

4434
02:33:53,610 --> 02:33:55,530
It's unfair.

4435
02:33:55,530 --> 02:33:57,520
Stop it already.

4436
02:34:02,850 --> 02:34:04,770
Did something happen?

4437
02:34:04,060 --> 02:34:05,010
Really, stop it now.

4438
02:34:04,970 --> 02:34:06,970
Stop it, you!

4439
02:34:11,860 --> 02:34:13,430
It's enough.

4440
02:34:11,860 --> 02:34:13,430
Stop fooling around.

4441
02:34:15,530 --> 02:34:15,930
This guy annoys me.

4442
02:34:15,930 --> 02:34:17,840
This guy annoys me.

4443
02:34:19,140 --> 02:34:20,190
There is a number 2 too.

4444
02:34:20,290 --> 02:34:21,420
Yes, there is a next.

4445
02:34:21,460 --> 02:34:23,440
There is the next thing too.

4446
02:34:26,190 --> 02:34:29,610
This is too much already.

4447
02:34:27,010 --> 02:34:29,680
Tanaka is so persistent.

4448
02:34:35,470 --> 02:34:37,170
Too persistent.

4449
02:34:37,170 --> 02:34:37,710
You! Quit fooling around.

4450
02:34:37,710 --> 02:34:39,790
You! Quit fooling around.

4451
02:34:41,590 --> 02:34:43,190
Are you happy with this?

4452
02:34:47,160 --> 02:34:48,520
That annoys me.

4453
02:34:50,970 --> 02:34:52,070
Such a dirty move.

4454
02:34:52,070 --> 02:34:52,500
You are so dirty.

4455
02:34:52,500 --> 02:34:54,620
You are so dirty.

4456
02:34:55,970 --> 02:34:56,590
You laughed inside of it.

4457
02:34:56,590 --> 02:34:57,490
You laughed inside of it.

4458
02:34:57,930 --> 02:34:58,530
Inside of it.

4459
02:34:58,510 --> 02:35:00,510
Definitely laughed inside of it.

4460
02:34:59,110 --> 02:35:01,110
Why did you do that?

4461
02:35:01,130 --> 02:35:02,300
Why do you do that? Really.

4462
02:35:02,410 --> 02:35:03,530
I completely became a part

4463
02:35:04,570 --> 02:35:05,180
of this kid.

4464
02:35:05,250 --> 02:35:06,900
You got too into it.

4465
02:35:07,450 --> 02:35:09,670
Honestly, I couldn't even hear you.

4466
02:35:09,850 --> 02:35:11,560
Then, Matsumoto.

4467
02:35:11,790 --> 02:35:14,130
I haven't even looked yet.

4468
02:35:13,770 --> 02:35:14,940
Then Hosei, right?

4469
02:35:22,220 --> 02:35:23,150
What's that?

4470
02:35:23,150 --> 02:35:28,470
Mysterious headphones

4471
02:35:23,630 --> 02:35:25,700
Headphones?

4472
02:35:27,070 --> 02:35:27,820
But why?

4473
02:35:28,520 --> 02:35:29,840
Let me

4474
02:35:29,870 --> 02:35:31,180
try and wear them.

4475
02:35:31,180 --> 02:35:32,040
While listening to something, something will happen?

4476
02:35:32,040 --> 02:35:33,040
While listening to something, something will happen?

4477
02:35:33,040 --> 02:35:35,210
While listening to something, something will happen?

4478
02:35:36,930 --> 02:35:37,630
Is that the purpose?

4479
02:35:42,120 --> 02:35:44,770
He's laughing.

4480
02:35:48,580 --> 02:35:50,340
This is cruel.

4481
02:35:49,060 --> 02:35:54,970
What is coming out of the headphones?

4482
02:35:54,970 --> 02:35:55,470
We have absolutely no clue.

4483
02:35:55,470 --> 02:35:58,050
We have absolutely no clue.

4484
02:35:58,050 --> 02:36:00,620
Can we listen to it?

4485
02:36:00,620 --> 02:36:01,020
This is cruel.

4486
02:36:01,020 --> 02:36:04,240
This is cruel.

4487
02:36:04,230 --> 02:36:06,210
We don't get it, though. Oh, we can listen?

4488
02:36:19,120 --> 02:36:21,530
This is. Just too much.

4489
02:36:21,960 --> 02:36:22,490
This is cheating, right?

4490
02:36:22,490 --> 02:36:24,410
This is cheating, right?

4491
02:36:23,310 --> 02:36:24,410
What, what what?

4492
02:36:25,850 --> 02:36:26,830
Can we also listen to it?

4493
02:36:26,860 --> 02:36:28,030
Well then, just let me

4494
02:36:28,030 --> 02:36:29,850
listen to it.

4495
02:36:29,180 --> 02:36:30,050
It's mean.

4496
02:36:36,290 --> 02:36:38,180
Can you even do such a thing?

4497
02:36:38,490 --> 02:36:39,540
This can't be real.

4498
02:36:39,560 --> 02:36:41,560
Can you even do this to us?

4499
02:36:41,880 --> 02:36:43,330
Such a great setup.

4500
02:36:43,330 --> 02:36:45,450
Such a great setup.

4501
02:36:45,470 --> 02:36:48,150
I really hate this.

4502
02:36:48,950 --> 02:36:50,020
I can't believe that they got me.

4503
02:36:50,020 --> 02:36:52,690
I can't believe that they got me.

4504
02:36:51,290 --> 02:36:52,920
It's a bit unbelivable, right?

4505
02:36:56,940 --> 02:37:01,520
If this was in a quiz, I would never guess it.

4506
02:37:03,330 --> 02:37:04,900
Wait, I am totally...

4507
02:37:04,950 --> 02:37:06,620
Can it really be this bad?

4508
02:37:07,020 --> 02:37:09,440
You will doubt your ears.

4509
02:37:08,690 --> 02:37:11,240
YEEEEEEAAAAAY!!

4510
02:37:11,230 --> 02:37:14,040
That's because we areee

4511
02:37:14,060 --> 02:37:15,060
I don't get it.

4512
02:37:15,110 --> 02:37:16,710
This is too much.

4513
02:37:17,280 --> 02:37:19,780
You laughed like a maniac.

4514
02:37:18,170 --> 02:37:19,770
You laughed a lot.

4515
02:37:20,840 --> 02:37:25,410
Ah, I completely lost track.

4516
02:37:26,210 --> 02:37:27,890
I still can't believe it.

4517
02:37:27,890 --> 02:37:29,990

02:38:23,930 --> 02:38:24,850
I will go ahead.

4557
02:38:32,390 --> 02:38:33,040
There it is.

4558
02:38:35,090 --> 02:38:36,590
Another challenge.

4559
02:38:35,330 --> 02:38:40,060
Mysterious letter

4560
02:38:36,590 --> 02:38:37,960
That's it.

4561
02:38:38,710 --> 02:38:39,750
Well, that's it.

4562
02:38:42,950 --> 02:38:44,700
Eh, what's this?

4563
02:38:44,850 --> 02:38:46,520
A gag bag?

4564
02:38:51,080 --> 02:38:55,110
Mysterious gag bag

4565
02:38:53,190 --> 02:38:54,350
Let's go with the letter first.

4566
02:38:55,250 --> 02:38:56,280
The letter will surely be something science-related.

4567
02:38:56,280 --> 02:38:59,220
The letter will surely be something science-related.

4568
02:38:57,460 --> 02:38:59,220
Probably, right?

4569
02:38:58,030 --> 02:38:59,220
It definitely will be.

4570
02:39:01,500 --> 02:39:02,340
Science quiz

4571
02:39:02,540 --> 02:39:03,500
It came out!

4572
02:39:07,040 --> 02:39:12,050
Kurobikari's notorious teacher's

4573
02:39:07,040 --> 02:39:12,050
science quiz!

4574
02:39:07,410 --> 02:39:10,140
The notorious teacher's science quiz!

4575
02:39:12,200 --> 02:39:20,070
For every question

4576
02:39:12,200 --> 02:39:20,070
a scientific punishment

4577
02:39:12,200 --> 02:39:20,070
if you answer incorrectly

4578
02:39:12,200 --> 02:39:20,070
will occur!!

4579
02:39:12,230 --> 02:39:14,920
If you answer wrong,

4580
02:39:15,130 --> 02:39:17,130
This is so scary.

4581
02:39:15,350 --> 02:39:18,790
you will receive a punishment from the notorious teacher.

4582
02:39:18,770 --> 02:39:20,770
And Tanaka was looking.

4583
02:39:19,800 --> 02:39:21,410
Here we go. The question:

4584
02:39:20,170 --> 02:39:22,990
Announcing the question

4585
02:39:23,320 --> 02:39:25,590
A plastic bag containing carbonated water

4586
02:39:24,340 --> 02:39:40,690
Q. What will happen if you heat a bag containing carbonated water?

4587
02:39:26,090 --> 02:39:28,400
what will happen if you heat it from below?

4588
02:39:29,050 --> 02:39:31,220
Please answer within 15 seconds.

4589
02:39:31,420 --> 02:39:32,870
Ready. Go!

4590
02:39:35,600 --> 02:39:37,000
It's a common plastic bag.

4591
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:38,970
Since it's a plastic bag, if you heat it

4592
02:39:39,360 --> 02:39:40,690
it will explode, right?

4593
02:39:40,940 --> 02:39:44,010
Answering time over

4594
02:39:43,090 --> 02:39:44,190
This is too much.

4595
02:39:44,410 --> 02:39:49,100
Enacting the correct answer!!

4596
02:39:44,850 --> 02:39:47,130
We will now enact the correct answer.

4597
02:39:48,250 --> 02:39:49,900
There must be a lot more to it.

4598
02:39:51,850 --> 02:39:52,870
The one who remembers the chemical elements

4599
02:39:52,870 --> 02:39:53,620
The one who remembers the chemical elements

4600
02:39:53,800 --> 02:39:56,440
Suiheilibe is a song that includes all the elements

4601
02:39:53,800 --> 02:39:56,440
"Water soldier liebe" is my ship

4602
02:39:53,800 --> 02:39:56,440
The title is made of the elements. Liebe is the german word for lover.

4603
02:39:56,470 --> 02:39:58,380
My boat is a mud boat

4604
02:39:58,380 --> 02:39:59,710
I am just saying!!

4605
02:39:59,860 --> 02:40:02,010
Dooaho!!

4606
02:40:02,010 --> 02:40:02,680
Are you done?

4607
02:40:02,680 --> 02:40:04,680
Thank you very much.

4608
02:40:07,950 --> 02:40:09,150
The problem is as follows

4609
02:40:09,750 --> 02:40:10,520
Who is the one who answered this question?

4610
02:40:10,520 --> 02:40:11,510
Who is the one who answered this question?

4611
02:40:11,910 --> 02:40:12,370
Me

4612
02:40:12,840 --> 02:40:13,560
Hosei?

4613
02:40:14,340 --> 02:40:15,240
Okay, Hosei's

4614
02:40:15,260 --> 02:40:15,810
answer. Let's hear it once again.

4615
02:40:15,810 --> 02:40:17,880
answer. Let's hear it once again.

4616
02:40:17,910 --> 02:40:19,280
Once heated...

4617
02:40:19,300 --> 02:40:20,280
The plastic vinyl bag will explode with a bang

4618
02:40:20,280 --> 02:40:21,050
The plastic vinyl bag will explode with a bang

4619
02:40:21,050 --> 02:40:22,620
The plastic vinyl bag will explode with a bang

4620
02:40:21,730 --> 02:40:23,000
Explode with a bang?

4621
02:40:24,050 --> 02:40:25,890
I don't get it

4622
02:40:27,170 --> 02:40:27,620
On this year's October 6 Hosei hosted an event

4623
02:40:27,620 --> 02:40:29,620
On this year's October 6 Hosei hosted an event

4624
02:40:29,970 --> 02:40:37,870
called "Let's eat French cuisine while listening to Hosei's rakugo"

4625
02:40:32,940 --> 02:40:37,870
I don't get it as much as I don't get Hosei's event

4626
02:40:41,590 --> 02:40:43,350
What's that?

4627
02:40:43,320 --> 02:40:51,380
Event Poster

4628
02:40:52,630 --> 02:40:54,250
You did your research

4629
02:40:56,280 --> 02:40:56,900
Now,

4630
02:40:56,900 --> 02:40:58,390
let us move to the experiment

4631
02:40:58,390 --> 02:41:02,510
Here in front of us, we have this plastic vinyl bag which contains carbonated water

4632
02:41:03,540 --> 02:41:05,530
Can you tell? Bubbles are forming

4633
02:41:06,690 --> 02:41:07,130
We will

4634
02:41:07,130 --> 02:41:08,000
use these alcohol lamp burners to heat it up from the bottom

4635
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:09,760
use these alcohol lamp burners to heat it up from the bottom

4636
02:41:09,760 --> 02:41:12,070
use these alcohol lamp burners to heat it up from the bottom

4637
02:41:12,080 --> 02:41:12,600
If it's water, it would go splash right?

4638
02:41:12,600 --> 02:41:14,600
If it's water, it would go splash right?

4639
02:41:13,680 --> 02:41:14,370
Yeah

4640
02:41:14,050 --> 02:41:15,670
I suppose so

4641
02:41:16,050 --> 02:41:17,640
Let's see how it goes.

4642
02:41:20,890 --> 02:41:21,790
What is it?

4643
02:41:26,750 --> 02:41:28,230
It's a science

4644
02:41:31,450 --> 02:41:32,240
The theory's like this.

4645
02:41:31,450 --> 02:41:37,320
*Done under the supervision of professionals

4646
02:41:33,820 --> 02:41:37,070
Carbonated water is basically water and carbonic acid

4647
02:41:38,490 --> 02:41:39,230
So,

4648
02:41:39,360 --> 02:41:43,750
this plastic vinyl is touching either water or carbonic acid

4649
02:41:39,440 --> 02:41:47,530
Heat is always touching the water and the carbon bubbles

4650
02:41:39,440 --> 02:42:06,790
Explanation from Professor Emeritus Kamikawa

4651
02:41:44,930 --> 02:41:47,420
Therefore, the parts which are touching water

4652
02:41:47,420 --> 02:41:50,740
have the heat absorbed by the water

4653
02:41:47,700 --> 02:41:58,650
Parts with water absorbs heat but parts with bubbles melt from heat

4654
02:41:50,740 --> 02:41:56,640
The parts touching the carbon bubbles does not let heat escape so holes will open up

4655
02:41:57,210 --> 02:41:59,880
The results thus become like this, like a shower

4656
02:41:58,780 --> 02:42:06,790
Holes only open in the parts with bubbles and water drips from these holes like a shower

4657
02:41:59,880 --> 02:42:04,450
as holes open up bit by bit in the plastic vinyl

4658
02:42:07,120 --> 02:42:08,390
Therefore, Hosei...

4659
02:42:08,570 --> 02:42:09,060
wrong answer!

4660
02:42:09,360 --> 02:42:13,280
Wrong answer

4661
02:42:10,120 --> 02:42:12,230
Science quiz: wrong answer

4662
02:42:13,210 --> 02:42:13,830
That was difficult

4663
02:42:14,110 --> 02:42:19,000
7 in a row air cannon, balloon explosion, commence!!

4664
02:42:14,710 --> 02:42:18,720
7 in a row air cannon, balloon explosion, commence!!

4665
02:42:25,960 --> 02:42:27,940
7 in a row?

4666
02:42:27,940 --> 02:42:30,110
This sure is large-scale

4667
02:42:30,260 --> 02:42:33,750
Here in front of you is the 7 in a row air cannon

4668
02:42:33,760 --> 02:42:35,820
This is super scary

4669
02:42:34,480 --> 02:42:35,830
This

4670
02:42:35,830 --> 02:42:36,980
is when oxygen

4671
02:42:36,170 --> 02:42:43,390
By stimulating the oxygen and hydrogen with electricity

4672
02:42:36,170 --> 02:42:50,500
7 in a row air cannon, balloon explosion

4673
02:42:37,900 --> 02:42:39,370
and hydrogen are stimulated with electricity to create an explosive force

4674
02:42:39,370 --> 02:42:42,840
and hydrogen are stimulated with electricity to create an explosive force

4675
02:42:43,590 --> 02:42:50,500
an explosive force is created, which is used to fire the cotton balls

4676
02:42:43,740 --> 02:42:47,680
That will be used to fire the cotton balls

4677
02:42:48,780 --> 02:42:50,630
Then, let's set up

4678
02:42:50,630 --> 02:42:51,330
Hosei, move to the designated place

4679
02:42:51,330 --> 02:42:53,470
Hosei, move to the designated place

4680
02:42:52,370 --> 02:42:53,670
Then, please come over here

4681
02:42:53,950 --> 02:42:56,600
he said "designated"

4682
02:42:58,360 --> 02:42:59,140
Be careful, okay, Hosei?

4683
02:42:59,140 --> 02:43:01,180
Be careful, okay, Hosei?

4684
02:43:01,440 --> 02:43:03,380
Ma~n, this is scary

4685
02:43:03,360 --> 02:43:04,850
Can everyone see?

4686
02:43:04,850 --> 02:43:06,850
Above Hosei's head, we have set up a balloon

4687
02:43:06,850 --> 02:43:08,850
Above Hosei's head, we have set up a balloon

4688
02:43:08,680 --> 02:43:09,780
Good position

4689
02:43:09,320 --> 02:43:10,170
There is  the character for "up" on the balloon

4690
02:43:09,320 --> 02:43:12,590
T/N: This refers to Kamikawa(上川). It is the same character 「上」 as the "kami" in Kamikawa's name, but pronounced differently)

4691
02:43:10,170 --> 02:43:12,590
There is the character for "up" on the balloon

4692
02:43:13,500 --> 02:43:18,630
This is the mark of the "Kamikawa liquid" that I have independently developed

4693
02:43:18,640 --> 02:43:24,100
Kamikawa liquid is inside the balloon

4694
02:43:19,090 --> 02:43:19,730
I see

4695
02:43:19,710 --> 02:43:22,010
Inside that is "Kamikawa liquid"

4696
02:43:22,010 --> 02:43:26,150
So, the cotton balls within this cannon

4697
02:43:26,650 --> 02:43:28,970
have been soaked in orange oil

4698
02:43:26,650 --> 02:43:33,410
7 in a row air cannon, balloon explosion

4699
02:43:26,650 --> 02:43:33,410
Cotton balls are soaked in orange oil

4700
02:43:29,620 --> 02:43:33,470
What do you think will happen when the orange oil touches that balloon?

4701
02:43:33,790 --> 02:43:34,660
We shall see

4702
02:43:35,690 --> 02:43:37,580
Ear plugs ...wait that's scary

4703
02:43:37,580 --> 02:43:38,810
Ear plugs ...wait that's scary

4704
02:43:38,830 --> 02:43:39,980
When hydrogen and carbon interact with each other, a loud noise will be produced

4705
02:43:39,980 --> 02:43:41,450
When hydrogen and carbon interact with each other, a loud noise will be produced

4706
02:43:41,450 --> 02:43:43,280
When hydrogen and carbon interact with each other, a loud noise will be produced

4707
02:43:46,040 --> 02:43:46,870
Please.

4708
02:43:46,970 --> 02:43:47,540
Then,

4709
02:43:48,410 --> 02:43:49,660
7 in a row air cannon:

4710
02:43:48,410 --> 02:43:53,890
Until the air cannon fires,

4711
02:43:48,410 --> 02:43:53,890
seconds

4712
02:43:53,910 --> 02:43:54,560
Fire!!

4713
02:44:00,700 --> 02:44:03,570
The smell of oranges...

4714
02:44:01,900 --> 02:44:03,470
Wow! A nice scent

4715
02:44:03,670 --> 02:44:05,670
Amazing!

4716
02:44:05,070 --> 02:44:07,910
As you can see, the orange oil has the disposition of melting the rubber of the balloon

4717
02:44:08,140 --> 02:44:16,180
7 in a row air cannon, balloon explosion

4718
02:44:08,140 --> 02:44:16,180
Orange oil melts the ballon and he is now covered with Kamikawa Liquid

4719
02:44:08,690 --> 02:44:11,450
Thus, the balloon above Hosei's head

4720
02:44:11,450 --> 02:44:16,520
burst due to this power, and now Hosei is covered with "Kamikawa liquid"

4721
02:44:16,150 --> 02:44:17,080
Oh I see

4722
02:44:17,180 --> 02:44:18,450
Wow! Amazing!

4723
02:44:18,650 --> 02:44:20,270
The experiment's a big success!

4724
02:44:18,700 --> 02:44:22,960
A punishment which covered the room in a nice scent

4725
02:44:21,670 --> 02:44:23,120
Thank you. Time to go.

4726
02:44:24,070 --> 02:44:26,330
The scent is also really nice

4727
02:44:25,140 --> 02:44:26,410
Within this room

4728
02:44:26,410 --> 02:44:27,360
Awesome

4729
02:44:27,640 --> 02:44:29,160
Good for you

4730
02:44:30,680 --> 02:44:31,670
Was it?

4731
02:44:32,420 --> 02:44:33,130
Super refreshing

4732
02:44:33,130 --> 02:44:34,800
Super refreshing

4733
02:44:34,800 --> 02:44:36,440
I'm totally soaked

4734
02:44:36,440 --> 02:44:37,090
Totally soaked

4735
02:44:37,370 --> 02:44:39,160
The smell is amazing

4736
02:44:37,800 --> 02:44:39,570
Not really?

4737
02:44:40,040 --> 02:44:41,480
No, I'm totally soaked through though

4738
02:44:41,280 --> 02:44:43,040
It might be difficult for the viewers to know

4739
02:44:42,660 --> 02:44:43,140
Yeah

4740
02:44:43,140 --> 02:44:44,260
It's amazing

4741
02:44:44,260 --> 02:44:46,510
The room now has a really lovely smell

4742
02:44:45,210 --> 02:44:46,280
A citrus type right?

4743
02:44:46,510 --> 02:44:48,520
The room now has a really lovely smell

4744
02:44:48,900 --> 02:44:50,980
There's one more here

4745
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:51,870
What is it?

4746
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:54,490
Mystery trick bag

4747
02:44:53,570 --> 02:44:54,670
Trick bag?

4748
02:44:54,610 --> 02:44:56,590
It does look like some sort of trick bag

4749
02:44:56,940 --> 02:44:57,590
I'll press it

4750
02:44:59,710 --> 02:45:01,830
WA HA HA HA HA...

4751
02:45:02,530 --> 02:45:05,670
WA HA HA HA HA...

4752
02:45:09,290 --> 02:45:14,010
If the trick bag is pressed, Hamada gets an OUT

4753
02:45:10,820 --> 02:45:12,240
Wait just a moment

4754
02:45:12,590 --> 02:45:14,220
This is no good

4755
02:45:16,460 --> 02:45:17,830
What's with that?

4756
02:45:18,210 --> 02:45:18,980
What's this?

4757
02:45:18,980 --> 02:45:20,580
What's this? I don't really get it

4758
02:45:22,720 --> 02:45:25,820
WA HA HA HA HA...

4759
02:45:27,620 --> 02:45:29,140
No no no

4760
02:45:29,140 --> 02:45:30,920
I didn't laugh!

4761
02:45:30,940 --> 02:45:31,260
Stop, stop!!

4762
02:45:31,260 --> 02:45:32,760
Stop, stop!!

4763
02:45:34,860 --> 02:45:35,900
A trick bag

4764
02:45:35,900 --> 02:45:36,680
Yes

4765
02:45:36,630 --> 02:45:37,920
This is wow

4766
02:45:37,360 --> 02:45:38,430
Enough

4767
02:45:38,430 --> 02:45:40,200
You can't press it

4768
02:45:40,200 --> 02:45:42,100
Enough

4769
02:45:40,950 --> 02:45:41,690
Tanaka, don't press it

4770
02:45:42,200 --> 02:45:45,310
WA HA HA HA HA...

4771
02:45:46,690 --> 02:45:48,310
Really, there's such a thing?

4772
02:45:48,310 --> 02:45:50,310
I didn't actually laugh!

4773
02:45:54,670 --> 02:45:56,280
Seriously

4774
02:45:58,390 --> 02:46:01,490
WA HA HA HA HA...

4775
02:46:09,800 --> 02:46:11,050
This is something terrible

4776
02:46:10,430 --> 02:46:11,800
A dreadful... weapon

4777
02:46:11,820 --> 02:46:13,700
Something terrible  has appeared

4778
02:46:12,130 --> 02:46:13,850
It's bad for us to hold this

4779
02:46:13,850 --> 02:46:14,330
Definitely a terrible thing

4780
02:46:14,350 --> 02:46:16,840
That's terrible

4781
02:46:15,840 --> 02:46:17,490
That's no good

4782
02:46:16,900 --> 02:46:18,460
I agree

4783
02:46:19,260 --> 02:46:21,190
It's spiteful

4784
02:46:21,140 --> 02:46:21,960
Right.

4785
02:46:24,490 --> 02:46:25,750
Hosei, you're all soaked through

4786
02:46:25,750 --> 02:46:26,880
Hosei, you're all soaked through

4787
02:46:26,880 --> 02:46:30,680
Let's go get you a change of clothes

4788
02:46:31,490 --> 02:46:32,220
He said a change of clothes

4789
02:46:32,450 --> 02:46:33,240
No choice

4790
02:46:39,440 --> 02:46:42,700
Seriously, what?

4791
02:46:42,960 --> 02:46:49,840
In the past, this had led to waves of chaos: Hosei's costume change

4792
02:46:43,830 --> 02:46:44,730
In the past, this had led to waves of chaos

4793
02:46:44,730 --> 02:46:46,730
In the past, this had led to waves of chaos

4794
02:46:47,450 --> 02:46:48,990
Hosei's costume change

4795
02:46:50,520 --> 02:46:51,040
Once you're done changing, return to the room

4796
02:46:51,040 --> 02:46:53,210
Once you're done changing, return to the room

4797
02:46:53,220 --> 02:46:55,010
What is this?

4798
02:46:55,590 --> 02:47:00,650
On the other hand, the 4 waiting in the room also...

4799
02:46:56,860 --> 02:46:59,250
The other 4 waiting also...

4800
02:47:00,880 --> 02:47:01,650
About the costume changes...

4801
02:47:01,650 --> 02:47:03,780
About the costume changes...

4802
02:47:02,770 --> 02:47:03,780
Like normal

4803
02:47:04,350 --> 02:47:05,050
Will he come back wearing something like a kabuto helmet?

4804
02:47:05,050 --> 02:47:06,650
Will he come back wearing something like a kabuto helmet?

4805
02:47:06,670 --> 02:47:13,730
Costume change 7 years ago

4806
02:47:09,870 --> 02:47:10,720
Wearing a kabuto helmet with a short moustache attached

4807
02:47:10,720 --> 02:47:13,730
Wearing a kabuto helmet with a short moustache attached

4808
02:47:11,220 --> 02:47:12,390
With that moustache

4809
02:47:13,260 --> 02:47:14,700
Ah yeah, that happened

4810
02:47:14,710 --> 02:47:16,160
I definitely won't laugh

4811
02:47:16,160 --> 02:47:17,230
For something like a costume, I definitely won't laugh

4812
02:47:17,230 --> 02:47:18,830
For something like a costume, I definitely won't laugh

4813
02:47:18,830 --> 02:47:19,730
For 2 or 3 days he couldn't take a bath

4814
02:47:19,730 --> 02:47:21,500
For 2 or 3 days he couldn't take a bath

4815
02:47:22,150 --> 02:47:23,570
He couldn't for 2-3 days.

4816
02:47:23,720 --> 02:47:24,790
Unprotected after all

4817
02:47:25,270 --> 02:47:26,460
That's true

4818
02:47:32,400 --> 02:47:35,820
Changed into Astro Boy

4819
02:47:32,400 --> 02:47:35,820
T/N: "Astro Boy" is a manga about an android boy by Tezuka Osamu in 1952. It was later made into an anime.

4820
02:47:36,570 --> 02:47:38,750
That's just a middle-aged man wearing a stomach wrap

4821
02:47:43,010 --> 02:47:43,920
"A middle-aged man wearing a stomach wrap"?

4822
02:47:44,990 --> 02:47:46,010
No, really.

4823
02:47:51,130 --> 02:47:53,370
T/N: "Child of Science" is Astro Boy's nickname

4824
02:47:51,130 --> 02:47:53,370
The "child of science"

4825
02:47:53,620 --> 02:47:54,230
That's right

4826
02:47:54,230 --> 02:47:55,370
So that's it

4827
02:47:55,700 --> 02:47:57,840
Those clothes were there when you went?

4828
02:47:57,370 --> 02:47:57,690
Yes

4829
02:47:57,850 --> 02:47:58,570
These clothes(scientist outfit) were notprepared for you there?

4830
02:47:58,570 --> 02:48:00,170
These clothes(scientist outfit) were not  prepared for you there?

4831
02:47:59,220 --> 02:48:00,170
Nope

4832
02:48:00,790 --> 02:48:02,440
There was only this costume

4833
02:48:03,130 --> 02:48:05,180
You understand right?

4834
02:48:07,560 --> 02:48:10,880
We thought you'd probably come back in some sort of costume

4835
02:48:11,250 --> 02:48:13,090
I feel cold

4836
02:48:14,020 --> 02:48:14,760
Seriously

4837
02:48:23,830 --> 02:48:25,630
I don't get the meaning of this

4838
02:48:30,650 --> 02:48:31,370
Big brother, so you were here!

4839
02:48:31,370 --> 02:48:33,470
Big brother, so you were here!

4840
02:48:33,470 --> 02:48:34,910
I picked this up

4841
02:48:35,590 --> 02:48:37,410
Uran-chan?

4842
02:48:37,910 --> 02:48:38,560
Uran-chan?

4843
02:48:37,910 --> 02:48:41,670
T/N: Uran(Astro Girl) is Astro Boy's younger sister.

4844
02:48:38,700 --> 02:48:39,830
You picked something up?

4845
02:48:39,960 --> 02:48:40,680
I picked this up

4846
02:48:40,830 --> 02:48:41,350
You picked that up?

4847
02:48:42,330 --> 02:48:45,440
WA HA HA HA HA...

4848
02:48:48,020 --> 02:48:49,320
Uran-chan, eh?

4849
02:48:49,340 --> 02:48:50,520
What's going on?

4850
02:48:49,340 --> 02:48:54,060
A trick bag containing the voice of Hosei

4851
02:48:50,520 --> 02:48:51,340
What's happening?

4852
02:48:51,340 --> 02:48:53,830
W-wait, just wait a moment

4853
02:48:54,900 --> 02:48:56,530
AAAHHH!!

4854
02:48:58,480 --> 02:49:04,540
If the bag is pressed, Housei gets an OUT

4855
02:49:00,550 --> 02:49:01,380
Uran-chan?

4856
02:49:01,380 --> 02:49:03,250
You can't do that, your big brother...

4857
02:49:03,440 --> 02:49:04,590
Yeah

4858
02:49:04,720 --> 02:49:07,510
WA HA HA HA HA...

4859
02:49:10,940 --> 02:49:11,650
Watch out!

4860
02:49:13,660 --> 02:49:14,710
Uran-chan, you can't...

4861
02:49:16,850 --> 02:49:18,340
Because your big brother...

4862
02:49:18,340 --> 02:49:18,950
...it hurts your big brother

4863
02:49:18,990 --> 02:49:19,800
You can't do that

4864
02:49:20,050 --> 02:49:22,060
AAAHHH!!

4865
02:49:22,310 --> 02:49:23,220
You can't press it

4866
02:49:24,270 --> 02:49:25,090
Uran-chan

4867
02:49:25,090 --> 02:49:27,360
Uran-chan, wait

4868
02:49:26,290 --> 02:49:27,180
Uran-chan, no.

4869
02:49:27,310 --> 02:49:28,260
Yeah, you can't

4870
02:49:29,010 --> 02:49:29,460
Uran!

4871
02:49:29,480 --> 02:49:30,780
Yeah?

4872
02:49:32,550 --> 02:49:34,300
My arm...

4873
02:49:33,730 --> 02:49:34,470
Come over here

4874
02:49:34,950 --> 02:49:35,700
What's wrong?

4875
02:49:35,700 --> 02:49:37,570
My arm's in bad shape

4876
02:49:38,520 --> 02:49:40,240
Even if you tell Uran that...

4877
02:49:40,240 --> 02:49:41,110
Uran-chan, look at this

4878
02:49:41,110 --> 02:49:42,780
Uran-chan, look at this

4879
02:49:42,090 --> 02:49:43,130
What? What?

4880
02:49:42,440 --> 02:49:43,910
He's going to try to snatch the bag

4881
02:49:45,310 --> 02:49:46,430
Press it, press it!

4882
02:49:46,600 --> 02:49:51,890
WA HA HA HA HA...

4883
02:49:47,110 --> 02:49:47,680
Press!

4884
02:49:55,910 --> 02:49:58,440
This place is becoming messy

4885
02:49:58,440 --> 02:49:58,890
Chaotic

4886
02:49:58,890 --> 02:50:00,990
This place is becoming chaotic

4887
02:50:03,030 --> 02:50:03,660
AAAHHH!!

4888
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:07,830
Why is Big Brother so angry?

4889
02:50:07,830 --> 02:50:09,040
Why is Big Brother so angry?

4890
02:50:09,040 --> 02:50:10,640
Big Brother

4891
02:50:09,650 --> 02:50:10,640
I hate you!!

4892
02:50:10,650 --> 02:50:11,240
I'm gonna tell Chono-san

4893
02:50:11,240 --> 02:50:11,940
I'm gonna tell Chono-san

4894
02:50:12,470 --> 02:50:14,470
URANNN

4895
02:50:17,690 --> 02:50:18,750
Come over here

4896
02:50:18,750 --> 02:50:20,110
I won't get mad just come here

4897
02:50:20,430 --> 02:50:22,880
You're definitely gonna get mad, right?

4898
02:50:21,530 --> 02:50:22,500
No, I won't

4899
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:24,330
I won't get mad, so come here

4900
02:50:24,630 --> 02:50:25,940
What the hell haha

4901
02:50:24,850 --> 02:50:25,350
If you get mad, can I tell Chono-san?

4902
02:50:25,350 --> 02:50:26,420
If you get mad, can I tell Chono-san?

4903
02:50:26,440 --> 02:50:27,990
It's okay if you tell Chono-san

4904
02:50:27,990 --> 02:50:29,760
It's okay if you tell Chono-san

4905
02:50:29,770 --> 02:50:30,390
I'll give you candy; just come here

4906
02:50:30,390 --> 02:50:31,690
I'll give you candy; just come here

4907
02:50:32,480 --> 02:50:34,260
How many candies?

4908
02:50:34,390 --> 02:50:35,160
I'll give you three

4909
02:50:35,650 --> 02:50:37,050
They're inside here

4910
02:50:37,030 --> 02:50:37,750
How about 10?

4911
02:50:37,760 --> 02:50:39,470
Yeah, I'll give you 10

4912
02:50:37,760 --> 02:50:42,840
FU HA HA HA HA...

4913
02:50:39,470 --> 02:50:40,630
Don't laugh...

4914
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,010
She pressed it at a great time

4915
02:50:48,440 --> 02:50:49,640
UUGGGHHHH

4916
02:50:51,180 --> 02:50:52,210
Peace, it's peace

4917
02:50:52,350 --> 02:50:54,850
AAAHHH

4918
02:50:52,810 --> 02:50:54,850
THAT HURTS!!!

4919
02:50:54,860 --> 02:50:55,780
I can't do this...   I can't do this

4920
02:50:55,780 --> 02:50:57,120
I can't do this...   I can't do this

4921
02:50:57,350 --> 02:50:58,590
Uran-chan,

4922
02:50:58,590 --> 02:50:59,090
Get it!! Get it, Endo; get it!!

4923
02:50:59,090 --> 02:50:59,750
Get it!! Get it, Endo; get it!!

4924
02:50:59,750 --> 02:51:01,770
Get it!! Get it, Endo; get it!!

4925
02:51:01,770 --> 02:51:02,620
Uran-chan, I'm gonna get mad

4926
02:51:02,620 --> 02:51:04,790
Uran-chan, I'm gonna get mad

4927
02:51:03,570 --> 02:51:05,110
She's too fast

4928
02:51:05,390 --> 02:51:06,590
She's incredible

4929
02:51:06,330 --> 02:51:06,590
Yeah

4930
02:51:06,960 --> 02:51:07,360
Uran-chan, what do you want?

4931
02:51:07,360 --> 02:51:08,960
Uran-chan, what do you want?

4932
02:51:09,010 --> 02:51:09,600
Seriously

4933
02:51:09,750 --> 02:51:11,600
I'll seriously buy it for you just...

4934
02:51:12,180 --> 02:51:12,970
Why don't you become a real person?

4935
02:51:12,970 --> 02:51:14,430
Why don't you become a real person?

4936
02:51:14,450 --> 02:51:15,540
Why don't you become a human girl?

4937
02:51:15,540 --> 02:51:18,310
Why don't you become a human girl?

4938
02:51:16,900 --> 02:51:18,240
I want a Hoppe-chan

4939
02:51:18,240 --> 02:51:25,310
T/N: Hoppe-chan is a popular Japanese character

4940
02:51:18,570 --> 02:51:23,210
Obecha?

4941
02:51:19,560 --> 02:51:20,440
Hoppe-chan

4942
02:51:25,310 --> 02:51:28,200
What the hell is Obecha?

4943
02:51:27,010 --> 02:51:28,160
What the hell is Obecha, really?

4944
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:29,900
What is Obecha?

4945
02:51:29,670 --> 02:51:32,320
What is Obecha exactly?

4946
02:51:29,870 --> 02:51:31,220
Seriously, what is Obecha?

4947
02:51:30,900 --> 02:51:32,120
I don't understand

4948
02:51:37,820 --> 02:51:39,930
Uran-chan...

4949
02:51:39,930 --> 02:51:41,730
Hopecha?

4950
02:51:41,750 --> 02:51:43,330
You want hopecha?

4951
02:51:43,350 --> 02:51:46,600
What is hopecha?

4952
02:51:44,630 --> 02:51:46,280
What could hopecha be?

4953
02:51:46,620 --> 02:51:46,970
Its cheeks are puffy, and

4954
02:51:46,970 --> 02:51:49,600
Its cheeks are puffy, and

4955
02:51:49,600 --> 02:51:52,410
its eyes are beads, and

4956
02:51:52,420 --> 02:51:53,910
it has a topknot...

4957
02:51:54,270 --> 02:51:57,510
You want something like that?

4958
02:51:56,580 --> 02:51:58,140
It's cute!!

4959
02:51:58,240 --> 02:51:59,810
They have such a thing?

4960
02:52:01,580 --> 02:52:03,520
She's saying she wants it! Let her be!

4961
02:52:03,120 --> 02:52:03,520
Seriously!

4962
02:52:03,500 --> 02:52:09,320
This is Hoppe-chan

4963
02:52:05,050 --> 02:52:06,020
Don't question her!

4964
02:52:06,020 --> 02:52:06,820
Oh, that!

4965
02:52:07,320 --> 02:52:09,240
Oh, Hoppe-chan!

4966
02:52:11,840 --> 02:52:12,830
They're especially rough on Atom

4967
02:52:12,830 --> 02:52:14,560
They're especially rough on Atom

4968
02:52:18,780 --> 02:52:19,780
They're hard on Atom

4969
02:52:20,600 --> 02:52:22,200
Uran-chan...

4970
02:52:22,240 --> 02:52:23,440
I'll get it for you

4971
02:52:23,950 --> 02:52:26,140
Obeja right?

4972
02:52:25,070 --> 02:52:26,290
Oh, wait a minute

4973
02:52:26,290 --> 02:52:28,070
Instead of Hoppe-chan,

4974
02:52:28,070 --> 02:52:28,810
make that face you make when you get slapped by Chono-san

4975
02:52:28,810 --> 02:52:32,710
make that face you make when you get slapped by Chono-san

4976
02:52:31,060 --> 02:52:32,910
What do you mean "that face you make"?

4977
02:52:33,260 --> 02:52:34,510
That face you make when you get slapped is hilarious

4978
02:52:34,510 --> 02:52:37,850
That face you make when you get slapped is hilarious

4979
02:52:36,380 --> 02:52:38,280
It is funny, isn't it?

4980
02:52:38,440 --> 02:52:39,690
Okay, here goes

4981
02:52:39,790 --> 02:52:40,450
Do it!! Do it!!

4982
02:52:43,660 --> 02:52:47,140
FU HA HA HA HA...

4983
02:52:44,390 --> 02:52:45,880
What are you doing?

4984
02:52:48,400 --> 02:52:49,350
What are you doing?

4985
02:52:48,850 --> 02:52:51,550
She's really making you work for that button

4986
02:52:52,030 --> 02:52:53,550
She really really is

4987
02:52:54,080 --> 02:52:56,470
AHHH

4988
02:52:54,450 --> 02:52:56,470
HA

4989
02:52:54,600 --> 02:52:56,470
HA

4990
02:52:54,770 --> 02:52:56,470
HA!!

4991
02:52:55,050 --> 02:52:56,420
This kid is scary

4992
02:52:58,370 --> 02:52:59,440
Uran-chan come, look

4993
02:52:59,440 --> 02:53:00,540
Uran-chan come, look

4994
02:53:00,540 --> 02:53:02,180
It's really bad, wanna see?

4995
02:53:02,190 --> 02:53:04,740
Nothing's there

4996
02:53:03,330 --> 02:53:04,480
Nothing's there, right?

4997
02:53:03,760 --> 02:53:04,740
Nothing, nothing

4998
02:53:04,760 --> 02:53:06,050
You can't say that nothing is there

4999
02:53:06,050 --> 02:53:07,350
You can't say that nothing is there

5000
02:53:06,550 --> 02:53:08,160
Nothing is there!!

5001
02:53:08,280 --> 02:53:09,750
THERE IS!!

5002
02:53:09,870 --> 02:53:10,730
Something's there, right?

5003
02:53:10,600 --> 02:53:11,520
Yes!

5004
02:53:11,550 --> 02:53:12,290
Something's there but I don't wanna see it

5005
02:53:12,290 --> 02:53:12,650
Something's there but I don't wanna see it

5006
02:53:12,650 --> 02:53:14,820
Something's there but I don't wanna see it

5007
02:53:14,520 --> 02:53:15,120
That's reasonable

5008
02:53:15,160 --> 02:53:18,990
Because earlier you smelled really bad

5009
02:53:19,190 --> 02:53:22,050
That's really cruel

5010
02:53:22,150 --> 02:53:24,060
Why did she have to say that?

5011
02:53:24,010 --> 02:53:25,670
She's really really scary

5012
02:53:25,980 --> 02:53:27,350
Why did she have to say that?

5013
02:53:27,650 --> 02:53:29,090
Uran-chan is so scary

5014
02:53:30,720 --> 02:53:31,540
That's something you can't help but notice, right?

5015
02:53:31,540 --> 02:53:33,470
That's something you can't help but notice, right?

5016
02:53:33,490 --> 02:53:35,980
Did I really smell bad?

5017
02:53:35,340 --> 02:53:36,980
He's not your brother anyway

5018
02:53:36,980 --> 02:53:39,780
You smelled like farts

5019
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:41,980
That's wrong, I don't smell like farts

5020
02:53:41,210 --> 02:53:43,220
Poor Yamazaki

5021
02:53:42,480 --> 02:53:44,480
Uran-chan,

5022
02:53:44,630 --> 02:53:47,490
what if I give you a better laughing bag?

5023
02:53:46,390 --> 02:53:47,020
I don't want it

5024
02:53:47,800 --> 02:53:50,460
Wait here

5025
02:53:48,610 --> 02:53:49,920
She said she doesn't want it

5026
02:53:51,640 --> 02:53:54,490
I'll give you a better laughing bag

5027
02:53:52,880 --> 02:53:55,200
Really? Promise?

5028
02:53:57,080 --> 02:53:59,720
FU HA HA HA HA...

5029
02:54:00,120 --> 02:54:03,690
FU HA HA HA HA...

5030
02:54:08,140 --> 02:54:10,030
No no no, let's not do this

5031
02:54:10,740 --> 02:54:11,710
What the hell?

5032
02:54:11,440 --> 02:54:13,280
She's really making a fool of us

5033
02:54:12,050 --> 02:54:12,910
Uran-chan, don't trip

5034
02:54:12,910 --> 02:54:14,130
Me too? Me too?

5035
02:54:14,630 --> 02:54:15,530
It's hard to tell

5036
02:54:15,700 --> 02:54:16,570
It was hard to tell who was out

5037
02:54:16,720 --> 02:54:18,700
We can't tell who's out and who's not

5038
02:54:17,900 --> 02:54:19,400
Hey you

5039
02:54:20,220 --> 02:54:23,320
FU HA HA HA HA...

5040
02:54:20,520 --> 02:54:21,590
Be careful

5041
02:54:23,990 --> 02:54:25,330
Stop!!

5042
02:54:26,680 --> 02:54:28,230
Stop, Yamazaki

5043
02:54:30,010 --> 02:54:31,150
Stop!!!

Seriously, you!

Be careful

5048
02:54:42,530 --> 02:54:43,540
Seriously, be careful

5049
02:54:43,090 --> 02:54:43,690
Careful!

5050
02:54:46,050 --> 02:54:46,910
Bleehhh!!

Trade, TRADE!!

5052
02:54:47,780 --> 02:54:48,580
Want to trade?

02:54:56,040 --> 02:54:59,090
FU HA HA HA HA...

5058
02:54:56,920 --> 02:54:58,320
What are you doing!

5059
02:54:58,640 --> 02:54:59,830
What the hell, man?

5060
02:55:00,740 --> 02:55:01,950
What are you doing?

5061
02:55:01,740 --> 02:55:03,350
He's crying!

5062
02:55:06,470 --> 02:55:08,020
What the hell?

5063
02:55:06,780 --> 02:55:07,470
Crying... Laughing... Getting beat up

5064
02:55:07,470 --> 02:55:08,670
Crying... Laughing... Getting beat up

5065
02:55:08,670 --> 02:55:10,200
Crying... Laughing... Getting beat up

5066
02:55:10,220 --> 02:55:12,570
This is a goddamn mess!!

5067
02:55:10,870 --> 02:55:11,600
What the hell, man?

5068
02:55:11,600 --> 02:55:13,460
Cut that out, Tanaka!

5069
02:55:12,770 --> 02:55:14,140
Seriously, man!!

5070
02:55:14,670 --> 02:55:16,060
It's getting wild

5071
02:55:15,890 --> 02:55:16,580
Look, look

5072
02:55:16,580 --> 02:55:18,140
Can you return the orange one?

5073
02:55:18,140 --> 02:55:19,050
Can you return the orange one?

5074
02:55:20,050 --> 02:55:21,050
He's scary, right?

5075
02:55:21,080 --> 02:55:22,100
Uran-chan is scared

5076
02:55:21,080 --> 02:55:22,750
Uran-chan

5077
02:55:22,730 --> 02:55:23,570
Give her the orange bag?

5078
02:55:23,750 --> 02:55:24,170
Please?

5079
02:55:24,250 --> 02:55:24,970
Thank you

5080
02:55:24,830 --> 02:55:25,450
You okay?

5081
02:55:25,850 --> 02:55:26,990
Your brother became unable to move

5082
02:55:26,990 --> 02:55:29,090
Your brother became unable to move

5083
02:55:27,140 --> 02:55:28,220
He's immobile

5084
02:55:28,020 --> 02:55:28,660
Yes, he is

5085
02:55:28,450 --> 02:55:29,710
He can't move

5086
02:55:30,370 --> 02:55:34,060
I'll give this to the old gorilla man...

5087
02:55:32,390 --> 02:55:34,060
You're giving this to the old gorilla man?

5088
02:55:34,610 --> 02:55:36,610
but DO NOT give this to my brother

5089
02:55:36,650 --> 02:55:37,410
Okay, got it

5090
02:55:37,380 --> 02:55:38,870
Bye bye

5091
02:55:39,580 --> 02:55:40,980
Bye bye, Uran-chan!

5092
02:55:41,050 --> 02:55:41,780
See you later

5093
02:55:41,650 --> 02:55:42,470
Thank you

5094
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:42,700
Bye bye!

5095
02:55:42,990 --> 02:55:43,600
Your brother-

5096
02:55:43,050 --> 02:55:44,500
BLEHHH

5097
02:55:45,360 --> 02:55:46,640
How terrible

5098
02:55:48,190 --> 02:55:48,680
This guy is really terrible

5099
02:55:48,680 --> 02:55:50,540
This guy is really terrible

5100
02:55:51,410 --> 02:55:53,060
He's terrible

5101
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:53,110
That was incredible

5102
02:55:52,980 --> 02:55:53,460
Sorry, that was really bad

5103
02:55:53,250 --> 02:55:55,350
This area was just a mess

5104
02:55:55,720 --> 02:55:57,900
This guy...

5105
02:55:58,330 --> 02:55:59,120
He's never lost it this bad

5106
02:55:59,120 --> 02:56:01,960
He's never lost it this bad

5107
02:56:00,040 --> 02:56:00,790
Really

5108
02:56:01,170 --> 02:56:03,170
Seriously

5109
02:56:02,520 --> 02:56:03,420
I don't get it

5110
02:56:04,640 --> 02:56:06,680
I really don't

5111
02:56:05,940 --> 02:56:11,050
FU HA HA HA HA...

5112
02:56:15,650 --> 02:56:18,070
The only option is to get it back

5113
02:56:17,320 --> 02:56:18,070
He's the devil

5114
02:56:20,890 --> 02:56:25,130
FU HA HA HA HA...

5115
02:56:21,290 --> 02:56:21,860
He's really the devil

5116
02:56:33,640 --> 02:56:38,710
FU HA HA HA HA...

5117
02:56:36,710 --> 02:56:41,030
Help me!!

5118
02:56:41,030 --> 02:56:41,780
Matsumoto-san

5119
02:56:41,780 --> 02:56:43,210
Seriously please

5120
02:56:43,450 --> 02:56:44,300
Where did it go? Where did it go?

5121
02:56:44,300 --> 02:56:46,630
Where did it go? Where did it go?

5122
02:56:47,370 --> 02:56:50,570
AHHH

5123
02:56:48,120 --> 02:56:50,570
HA

5124
02:56:48,350 --> 02:56:50,570
HA

5125
02:56:48,590 --> 02:56:50,570
HA!!

5126
02:56:49,450 --> 02:56:51,250
I don't know where Hamada-san went

5127
02:56:51,850 --> 02:56:52,440
Uran-chan took it, didn't she?

5128
02:56:52,440 --> 02:56:54,540
Uran-chan took it, didn't she?

5129
02:56:53,760 --> 02:56:54,310
Uran-chan!

5130
02:56:54,640 --> 02:56:55,690
Where did Uran-chan go?

5131
02:56:56,460 --> 02:57:01,580
FU HA HA HA HA...

5132
02:57:04,430 --> 02:57:06,600
URAN-CHAAAAN!!

5133
02:57:07,220 --> 02:57:08,020
AHHH

5134
02:57:07,800 --> 02:57:09,270
What a mess!

5135
02:57:09,620 --> 02:57:11,620
Seriously...

5136
02:57:11,620 --> 02:57:12,530
It's wrong, right?

5137
02:57:11,890 --> 02:57:13,460
DEVIL'S CHILD!!

5138
02:57:13,040 --> 02:57:13,460
He's wrong

5139
02:57:13,460 --> 02:57:15,460
DEVIL'S CHILD!!

5140
02:57:15,710 --> 02:57:16,930
URAN-CHAN!!

5141
02:57:17,180 --> 02:57:18,360
Tanaka~~

5142
02:57:18,380 --> 02:57:19,230
If you don't bring back my laughing bag,

5143
02:57:19,230 --> 02:57:22,640
If you don't bring back my laughing bag,

5144
02:57:20,050 --> 02:57:22,640
we'll never go home

5145
02:57:21,630 --> 02:57:22,800
I'm on it!

5146
02:57:22,800 --> 02:57:23,600
BRING ME MY LAUGHING BAG!!

5147
02:57:23,600 --> 02:57:26,310
BRING ME MY LAUGHING BAG!!

5148
02:57:24,920 --> 02:57:26,560
Hosei-san you're fine!!

5149
02:57:26,620 --> 02:57:29,610
How about we switch it with my laughing bag?

5150
02:57:27,540 --> 02:57:28,980
It's not here anymore

5151
02:57:29,040 --> 02:57:29,630
It's not here!

5152
02:57:29,630 --> 02:57:30,810
Nobody is gonna press it!

5153
02:57:31,190 --> 02:57:33,200
BRING MY LAUGHING BAG!

5154
02:57:37,020 --> 02:57:38,030
What did you want?

5155
02:57:38,640 --> 02:57:40,990
GET MY LAUGHING BAG AND COME OVER HERE

5156
02:57:40,990 --> 02:57:42,390
GET MY LAUGHING BAG AND COME OVER HERE

5157
02:57:42,810 --> 02:57:43,320
Go take it

5158
02:57:43,320 --> 02:57:44,590
I just bring it to you?

5159
02:57:44,290 --> 02:57:45,090
He'll bring it!!

5160
02:57:45,120 --> 02:57:48,700
Switching the contents of the laughing bags

5161
02:57:46,240 --> 02:57:47,680
You just want me to take it to you?

5162
02:57:48,850 --> 02:57:49,800
Hurry up!

5163
02:57:51,760 --> 02:57:53,400
Please hurry up

5164
02:57:53,880 --> 02:57:56,870
Tell him "I brought Hamada-san's bag instead"

5165
02:57:54,830 --> 02:57:56,600
Yeah, we got it

5166
02:57:57,500 --> 02:57:58,620
Seriously

5167
02:57:57,500 --> 02:57:58,670
Let's stop

5168
02:57:59,570 --> 02:58:01,110
"I brought Hamada-san's bag instead," right?

5169
02:58:07,560 --> 02:58:09,220
"I brought Hamada-san's bag instead"

5170
02:58:09,380 --> 02:58:13,000
FU HA HA HA HA...

5171
02:58:17,210 --> 02:58:18,120
He pressed it immediately

5172
02:58:18,890 --> 02:58:22,600
AHHHHHHHHHH!!

5173
02:58:23,360 --> 02:58:25,580
He had an expression like "great job" and then immediately pressed it

5174
02:58:27,500 --> 02:58:30,390
Like "really good job"

5175
02:58:32,020 --> 02:58:35,940
To press it outside is...

5176
02:58:37,110 --> 02:58:38,930
9 hours of science research

5177
02:58:37,710 --> 02:58:42,380
Science laboratory 9th hour of work

5178
02:58:39,410 --> 02:58:42,070
Now, they experience a very scientific event

5179
02:58:44,150 --> 02:58:44,900
You listening?

5180
02:58:45,500 --> 02:58:47,090
Unlike you guys,

5181
02:58:47,400 --> 02:58:51,890
real professors who actually graduated from college are

5182
02:58:49,640 --> 02:58:51,890
going to present the findings of their research

5183
02:58:51,890 --> 02:58:54,130
Do you need to include the first part?

5184
02:58:54,130 --> 02:58:55,060
What bad sense

5185
02:58:55,410 --> 02:58:58,330
You might not be able to tell just by looking at them...

5186
02:58:57,100 --> 02:58:58,330
That also pisses me off

5187
02:58:59,320 --> 02:59:07,670
Off to a science conference!!

5188
02:58:59,320 --> 02:59:07,670
Presentation of Research Results

5189
02:58:59,580 --> 02:59:01,520
We've been hungry until now, so

5190
02:59:02,950 --> 02:59:03,840
Yes, well

5191
02:59:08,270 --> 02:59:09,290
Over here, guys

5192
02:59:08,440 --> 02:59:11,540
Science Lab Hall

5193
02:59:11,860 --> 02:59:12,880
Hey hey

5194
02:59:13,130 --> 02:59:15,080
You're gonna show up late as newbies?

5195
02:59:15,080 --> 02:59:18,250
Kobayashi Kendo

5196
02:59:15,080 --> 02:59:18,250
Senior Researcher

5197
02:59:20,420 --> 02:59:21,790
Hurry up and sit down

5198
02:59:23,460 --> 02:59:24,070
With that,

5199
02:59:24,070 --> 02:59:27,110
I would like to start the research presentation conference

5200
02:59:27,340 --> 02:59:28,530
First off, development time took 10 years

5201
02:59:28,530 --> 02:59:30,400
First off, development time took 10 years

5202
02:59:30,410 --> 02:59:32,000
The higher-ups of our research laboratory backed us with their wisdom to create

5203
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:34,000
The higher-ups of our research laboratory backed us with their wisdom to create

5204
02:59:34,500 --> 02:59:37,140
A human like robe- human-like robot

5205
02:59:41,190 --> 02:59:42,480
That's so dirty!!

5206
02:59:42,680 --> 02:59:44,030
That shouldn't be allowed!

5207
02:59:44,810 --> 02:59:45,780
"Robet," he says

5208
02:59:47,110 --> 02:59:48,360
I guess he had to

5209
02:59:47,980 --> 02:59:48,970
That hurt

5210
02:59:49,070 --> 02:59:50,480
He's a well behaved kid though

5211
02:59:50,480 --> 02:59:51,730
Well, with that,

5212
02:59:50,480 --> 02:59:52,490
He's a well-behaved kid though

5213
02:59:52,750 --> 02:59:55,150
the introduction of the human-like robot!!

5214
02:59:55,150 --> 02:59:57,660
the introduction of the human-like robot!!

5215
02:59:57,920 --> 02:59:59,610
We now present...

5216
03:00:00,210 --> 03:00:02,030
BEAT TAKESHI ROBOT!!

5217
03:00:02,610 --> 03:00:06,870
Debut of the Beat Takeshi Robot

5218
03:00:05,410 --> 03:00:07,420
What a mess this was

5219
03:00:08,530 --> 03:00:11,370
Beat Takeshi Robot

5220
03:00:08,530 --> 03:00:11,370
Rola

5221
03:00:14,860 --> 03:00:16,140
She came out for real.

5222
03:00:16,140 --> 03:00:18,130
Why did she do that just now?

5223
03:00:19,510 --> 03:00:21,100
Is she making fun of Takeshi?

5224
03:00:28,440 --> 03:00:30,010
How about it? Can you show us a splendid performance?

5225
03:00:30,440 --> 03:00:32,140
Please introduce yourself.

5226
03:00:33,140 --> 03:00:36,750
This ain't no joke, ya idiot.

5227
03:00:37,050 --> 03:00:38,350
I am Beat Takeshi.

5228
03:00:38,350 --> 03:00:38,550
Ah, I am Beat Takeshi.

5229
03:00:38,550 --> 03:00:39,980
Ah, I am Beat Takeshi.

5230
03:00:40,420 --> 03:00:43,650
Can't do impressions at all

5231
03:00:45,760 --> 03:00:47,910
Why are you moving?

5232
03:00:48,310 --> 03:00:49,530
Please don't move, Mr. Takeshi.

5233
03:00:49,530 --> 03:00:50,730
Please don't move, Mr. Takeshi.

5234
03:00:55,630 --> 03:00:57,200
Let's hold back.

5235
03:00:57,200 --> 03:00:58,870
Takeshi robot's other ability: let's show you.

5236
03:00:58,870 --> 03:01:00,670
Takeshi robot's other ability: let's show you.

5237
03:01:01,220 --> 03:01:08,810
Given any theme about unlikable scientists the robot








will perfectly be able to improvise on it.

5238
03:01:01,220 --> 03:01:08,810
Takeshi robot's ability ①

5239
03:01:05,460 --> 03:01:08,080
Was your name Endo?
Then you go first.

5240
03:01:08,810 --> 03:01:10,510
Every day eating nothing but curry rice scientist.

5241
03:01:10,510 --> 03:01:15,070
Every day eating nothing but curry rice scientist.

5242
03:01:16,250 --> 03:01:18,040
If two people meet

5243
03:01:18,040 --> 03:01:20,020
and the curry smell lingers

5244
03:01:20,620 --> 03:01:23,160
it's as if turmeric is protruding.

5245
03:01:23,430 --> 03:01:24,290
Surely is no good, no good, no good.

5246
03:01:24,290 --> 03:01:24,730
Surely is no good, no good, no good.

5247
03:01:24,730 --> 03:01:25,130
Surely is no good, no good, no good.

5248
03:01:25,130 --> 03:01:25,900
Surely is no good, no good, no good.

5249
03:01:25,900 --> 03:01:26,360
Ya idiot, fu fu.

5250
03:01:26,360 --> 03:01:27,600
Ya idiot, fu fu.

5251
03:01:29,130 --> 03:01:33,040
The talent lacks in perfection

5252
03:01:43,980 --> 03:01:44,800
Takeshi robot, retreat at once.

5253
03:01:44,800 --> 03:01:46,050
Takeshi robot, retreat at once.

5254
03:01:46,920 --> 03:01:52,320
Takeshi robot's immediate retreat

5255
03:01:48,850 --> 03:01:52,320
She might appear in something else?

5256
03:01:52,320 --> 03:01:53,490
There might be scientific value in having







amateurs like you ask a question.

5257
03:01:53,490 --> 03:01:55,190
There might be scientific value in having







amateurs like you ask a question.

5258
03:01:55,190 --> 03:01:57,230
There might be scientific value in having







amateurs like you ask a question.

5259
03:01:57,230 --> 03:01:57,760
Are there any questions? Hosei.

5260
03:01:57,760 --> 03:01:59,660
Are there any questions? Hosei.

5261
03:01:59,660 --> 03:02:01,650
Regarding Takeshi robot

5262
03:02:02,100 --> 03:02:04,150
Does it have a special move?

5263
03:02:02,100 --> 03:02:07,790
Takeshi robot's special move.

5264
03:02:04,230 --> 03:02:06,090
I was waiting for this question.

5265
03:02:06,570 --> 03:02:07,790
I won't tell you!!

5266
03:02:09,270 --> 03:02:12,160
Tanaka.

5267
03:02:10,360 --> 03:02:11,560
Let me see...

5268
03:02:13,590 --> 03:02:18,900
What kind of trouble might occur?

5269
03:02:16,410 --> 03:02:17,730
Only this thing I won't tell you!!

5270
03:02:17,730 --> 03:02:18,900
Only this thing I won't tell you!!

5271
03:02:20,020 --> 03:02:21,970
Matsumoto, anything?

5272
03:02:22,540 --> 03:02:25,120
How is it supplied with energy?

5273
03:02:22,540 --> 03:02:29,560
Takeshi robot's energy

5274
03:02:25,120 --> 03:02:27,160
This is the secret to this robot

5275
03:02:27,260 --> 03:02:29,560
I won't tell you!!

5276
03:02:30,210 --> 03:02:33,860
The price is?

5277
03:02:31,380 --> 03:02:33,860
Won't tell you!

5278
03:02:34,130 --> 03:02:35,700
How much is the price?

5279
03:02:35,700 --> 03:02:37,530
1 billion yen

5280
03:02:42,370 --> 03:02:43,910
Asked twice and he will respond.

5281
03:02:49,280 --> 03:02:53,220
It's not absurdly overpriced.

5282
03:02:51,850 --> 03:02:53,030
You get all that.

5283
03:02:55,950 --> 03:02:56,790
Ain't no joke, ya fool.

5284

What's wrong?

5317
03:04:27,280 --> 03:04:29,030
I understand.

5318
03:04:29,550 --> 03:04:31,750

It's definitely this bastard.

Long time no see.

03:05:34,730 --> 03:05:36,480
Yoshinobu.

5340
03:05:38,150 --> 03:05:39,780
It's been a while, hasn't it?

5341
03:05:44,220 --> 03:05:46,560
She completely cut him off.

5342
03:05:47,820 --> 03:05:49,230

5343
03:05:55,350 --> 03:05:56,430

Stand up, won't you?

5350
03:06:08,910 --> 03:06:11,850
What kind of scientist do you want to be?

5351

World's

5352
03:06:14,250 --> 03:06:18,440
You don't have to answer seriously.

5353
03:06:18,440 --> 03:06:22,290
Only because you are so cute.

5354
03:06:19,310 --> 03:06:22,290
Only because you are so cute.

5355
03:06:34,790 --> 03:06:35,970
You there, won't you stand up?

5356
03:06:35,970 --> 03:06:38,040
You there, won't you stand up?

Wow, what a great chest.

5359
03:06:45,200 --> 03:06:47,650
What is the percentage of your body fat?

5360
03:06:47,650 --> 03:06:51,020
About 12-13%, don't you think?

5361
03:06:51,470 --> 03:06:53,790
So great.

5362
03:06:55,660 --> 03:07:02,450
Asking about body fat and the esteemed professor falls in love

5363
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:25,440
Merely being asked about body fat and you get kissed...

5364
03:07:25,640 --> 03:07:26,560
Having such great newcomers, I feel







completely relieved.

5365
03:07:26,560 --> 03:07:27,360
Having such great newcomers, I feel







completely relieved.

5366
03:07:27,360 --> 03:07:29,490
Having such great newcomers, I feel







completely relieved.

5367
03:07:29,490 --> 03:07:31,630
Having such great newcomers, I feel







completely relieved.

5368
03:07:31,630 --> 03:07:32,530
That's true, Yuuko.

5369
03:07:32,530 --> 03:07:33,760
That's true, Yuuko.

5370
03:07:34,030 --> 03:07:35,930
Yoshinobu.

5371
03:07:36,700 --> 03:07:41,590
This time the esteemed professor falls in love with Yoshinobu

5372
03:07:45,940 --> 03:07:46,810
Sorry, impossible!!

5373
03:07:46,810 --> 03:07:47,880
Sorry, impossible!!

5374
03:07:47,830 --> 03:07:50,010
For me to appear

5375
03:07:47,880 --> 03:07:53,120
From esteemed professor, back to Asano Yuuko.

5376
03:07:50,400 --> 03:07:51,800
in a variety show

5377
03:07:51,950 --> 03:07:53,280
after all,

5378
03:07:56,300 --> 03:07:59,720
it's a strange incident, isn't it?

5379
03:08:01,410 --> 03:08:07,200
The strange thing about Asano






Asano Yuuko                                Egu-Splosion

5380
03:08:01,410 --> 03:08:07,200
TN: Parody of the song "Honnō-ji incident" by Egu-Splosion
The word strange and incident is the same in Japanese.

5381
03:08:07,800 --> 03:08:10,000
The Asano incident

5382
03:08:10,120 --> 03:08:14,440
Year 2016 new year's disaster

5383
03:08:12,120 --> 03:08:14,440
Year 2016 new year's disaster

5384
03:08:14,440 --> 03:08:18,610
Asano Yuuko was tricked by Gaki no Tsukai!!

5385
03:08:18,760 --> 03:08:23,280
Why-y?        Why-y?        Why was Asano tricked?

5386
03:08:23,280 --> 03:08:27,450
Asano Yuuko was persistently begged by the staff

5387
03:08:25,380 --> 03:08:27,450
Asano Yuuko was persistently  begged by the staff

5388
03:08:27,620 --> 03:08:32,440
and by that guy over there:    50 year plus with a bald forehead

5389
03:08:32,440 --> 03:08:36,290
Why-y?        Why-y?        Why was Asano tricked?

5390
03:08:36,340 --> 03:08:40,660
I heard that practising the skit would only take 2 days

5391
03:08:40,730 --> 03:08:45,470
But this geezer's memory is so bad that it took 5 days

5392
03:08:45,470 --> 03:08:49,810
Call him a producer if you want, but he is a subcontracted producer

5393
03:08:49,870 --> 03:08:54,310
Expecting to get some gratitude   from Asano he has gained nada

5394
03:08:54,310 --> 03:08:58,480
Not great        Not great        Yoshinobu is not great at all

5395
03:08:58,480 --> 03:09:02,950
Day by day I feel older    but it's really my luck that has gone

5396
03:09:03,020 --> 03:09:07,520
tricked by a bald forehead   worst new year's eve   hey!!

5397
03:09:07,520 --> 03:09:11,730
Too harsh?  Too harsh?  Isn't that too harsh from an Asano in her 50's?

5398
03:09:11,760 --> 03:09:16,230
Not strange

5399
03:09:13,000 --> 03:09:16,230
Not strange

5400
03:09:14,200 --> 03:09:16,230
Asano in her 50's is not strange!!

5401
03:09:16,350 --> 03:09:20,070
Strange

5402
03:09:17,020 --> 03:09:20,070
Strange

5403
03:09:17,620 --> 03:09:20,070
Strange

5404
03:09:18,170 --> 03:09:20,070
Strange

5405
03:09:18,750 --> 03:09:20,070
Strange

5406
03:09:18,920 --> 03:09:20,070
Strange

5407
03:09:19,170 --> 03:09:20,070
Strange

5408
03:09:19,500 --> 03:09:20,070
Strange

5409
03:09:19,790 --> 03:09:20,070
Strange

5410
03:09:20,150 --> 03:09:29,780
This is the Asano incident

5411
03:09:22,990 --> 03:09:29,780
Asano incident

5412
03:09:25,290 --> 03:09:29,780
Asano incident

5413
03:09:27,440 --> 03:09:29,780
A●sa●no in●ci●dent

5414
03:09:29,950 --> 03:09:33,520
Asano Yuuko was me!!

5415
03:09:39,340 --> 03:09:41,390
It really was amazing.

5416
03:09:47,600 --> 03:09:48,600
Everyone, please study hard.

5417
03:09:48,600 --> 03:09:50,770
Everyone, please study hard.

5418
03:09:53,340 --> 03:09:55,890
Esteemed professor

5419
03:09:54,000 --> 03:09:55,890
thank you very much.

5420
03:09:55,890 --> 03:09:58,710
Yoshinobu was glaring at us

5421
03:09:58,710 --> 03:10:00,210
Let's go back to the presentation and announce the next robot.

5422
03:10:00,210 --> 03:10:01,830
Let's go back to the presentation and announce the next robot.

5423
03:10:01,830 --> 03:10:04,710
Kenkoba professor, this is bad!!

5424
03:10:05,380 --> 03:10:08,120
Someone has

5425
03:10:06,620 --> 03:10:08,120
stolen the robot

5426
03:10:08,080 --> 03:10:09,890
What!? The robot was taken?

5427
03:10:08,820 --> 03:10:15,790
Someone has stolen the new robot model!!

5428
03:10:09,890 --> 03:10:11,340
Call the police.

5429
03:10:11,290 --> 03:10:12,640
They're already on the way here

5430
03:10:12,640 --> 03:10:15,790
Who is the one behind this!?

5431
03:10:15,790 --> 03:10:21,380
Police officer arrives

5432
03:10:21,400 --> 03:10:22,050
Sorry for keeping you waiting, Professor Kenkoba!!

5433
03:10:22,050 --> 03:10:24,250
Sorry for keeping you waiting, Professor Kenkoba!!

5434
03:10:23,120 --> 03:10:24,250
Who are you?!!

5435
03:10:24,270 --> 03:10:27,420
Akira 100%

5436
03:10:24,270 --> 03:10:27,420
Unarmed inspector

5437
03:10:24,520 --> 03:10:25,870
I am the Unarmed Inspector

5438
03:10:26,440 --> 03:10:27,150
So you're Mr. Unarmed

5439
03:10:27,440 --> 03:10:28,220
I was slightly shook. Apologies.

5440
03:10:28,220 --> 03:10:29,820
I was slightly shocked. Apologies. I forgot.

5441
03:10:30,540 --> 03:10:32,990
Search for clues!!

5442
03:10:33,240 --> 03:10:34,180
Well then,

5443
03:10:34,180 --> 03:10:36,180
Were there any witnesses?

5444
03:10:36,550 --> 03:10:39,500
The culprit was holding a pistol

5445
03:10:38,350 --> 03:10:39,500
That's dangerous,

5446
03:10:40,420 --> 03:10:41,220
but what is my subordinate doing?

5447
03:10:41,220 --> 03:10:43,170
but what is my subordinate doing?

5448
03:10:44,090 --> 03:10:48,410
Unarmed inspector's subordinate arrives

5449
03:10:48,410 --> 03:10:52,630
Harada Ryuuji

5450
03:10:48,410 --> 03:10:52,630
Unarmed detective

5451
03:10:49,190 --> 03:10:51,530
Sorry for keeping you waiting

5452
03:10:51,530 --> 03:10:52,630
You're late!

5453
03:11:01,100 --> 03:11:02,690
What's he doing here?

5454
03:11:07,290 --> 03:11:08,510
Can he do it?

5455
03:11:08,530 --> 03:11:10,860
I always see him acting as Suke-san in "Mito Koumon"

5456
03:11:08,530 --> 03:11:10,860
T/N: "Mito Koumon" is a long-running period drama which was on-air since 1969 till 2011. Suke-san is a supporting character played by Harada.

5457
03:11:10,880 --> 03:11:13,420
T/N: Onsen actor is his nickname, as he likes going to various onsens around Japan

5458
03:11:10,880 --> 03:11:13,420
You look like that onsen actor, Harada Ryuuji

5459
03:11:12,680 --> 03:11:13,420
smack

5460
03:11:13,370 --> 03:11:15,170
He can do it?

5461
03:11:15,170 --> 03:11:16,600
How is the situation at the scene?

5462
03:11:17,190 --> 03:11:19,290
I heard the centerpiece robot was stolen;

5463
03:11:19,820 --> 03:11:21,210
the rookies were also surely looking forward to it

5464
03:11:21,210 --> 03:11:24,210
the rookies were also surely looking forward to it

5465
03:11:24,230 --> 03:11:27,710
Request for the 5 to cooperate in the investigation

5466
03:11:24,540 --> 03:11:25,130
Everyone,

5467
03:11:25,530 --> 03:11:27,710
I ask of you to please help with the investigation

5468
03:11:28,500 --> 03:11:29,450
This is who I am

5469
03:11:30,650 --> 03:11:31,270
This is who I am

5470
03:11:31,920 --> 03:11:36,090
Proof of identity in place of a police identification card

5471
03:11:38,660 --> 03:11:41,030
He must have practised that a lot

5472
03:11:45,900 --> 03:11:47,930
I think they must have practised a lot

5473
03:11:48,550 --> 03:11:50,000
For those who were not able to see: one more time

5474
03:11:50,000 --> 03:11:53,510
For those who were not able to see: one more time

5475
03:11:52,120 --> 03:11:53,510
It's enough

5476
03:11:55,510 --> 03:11:56,390
This is who I am

5477
03:12:02,900 --> 03:12:03,770
We have confirmed your identity

5478
03:12:05,000 --> 03:12:07,920
We really couldn't see (the crotch)

5479
03:12:12,810 --> 03:12:16,300
I am Unarmed Detective

5480
03:12:16,810 --> 03:12:17,900
Pleased to meet you

5481
03:12:21,450 --> 03:12:22,220
That's right, unarmed!!

5482
03:12:24,220 --> 03:12:27,370
Naked butt in front of the face

5483
03:12:29,510 --> 03:12:32,180
Spiteful!!

5484
03:12:30,390 --> 03:12:31,910
What the hell?

5485
03:12:32,180 --> 03:12:34,710
You didn't need to call him!!

5486
03:12:41,020 --> 03:12:41,720
Unarmed inspector!

5487
03:12:42,240 --> 03:12:45,110
Clues found?

5488
03:12:45,660 --> 03:12:47,230
smack

5489
03:12:46,310 --> 03:12:47,230
smack

5490
03:12:46,580 --> 03:12:48,880
Please take a look at this

5491
03:12:56,170 --> 03:12:59,390
Is there such a thing as that?

5492
03:13:06,860 --> 03:13:07,880
Something dropped!!

5493
03:13:07,880 --> 03:13:08,650
Something dropped!! Pick it up.

5494
03:13:12,600 --> 03:13:13,250
Blond hair

5495
03:13:13,540 --> 03:13:16,340
Clue to the criminal: Blond hair

5496
03:13:14,550 --> 03:13:16,340
Hey, there's some there too

5497
03:13:18,810 --> 03:13:20,560
Blond hair...

5498
03:13:20,680 --> 03:13:22,580
Professor, do you happen to know of a man with blond hair?

5499
03:13:22,580 --> 03:13:24,430
Professor, do you happen to know of a man with blond hair?

5500
03:13:25,300 --> 03:13:27,970
The young intern who quit the other day was blond, I believe

5501
03:13:27,970 --> 03:13:30,670
The young intern who quit the other day was blond, I believe

5502
03:13:30,690 --> 03:13:33,170
That man must have been the  culprit

5503
03:13:34,590 --> 03:13:36,060
hm? You over there

5504
03:13:36,060 --> 03:13:38,010
hm? You over there

5505
03:13:38,280 --> 03:13:42,650
With a hat on his head, a suspicious man...

5506
03:13:38,280 --> 03:13:42,650
could you take off that cap?

5507
03:13:44,100 --> 03:13:45,350
Blond hair... He must be the culprit!!

5508
03:13:45,350 --> 03:13:47,050
Blond hair... He must be the culprit!!

5509
03:13:47,090 --> 03:13:48,820
Wait, criminal!!

5510
03:13:47,090 --> 03:13:48,820
Wait, criminal!!

5511
03:13:49,810 --> 03:13:54,830
Pursuit of the criminal starts

5512
03:13:50,490 --> 03:13:52,160
Don't think you can escape from me

5513
03:13:58,550 --> 03:14:00,070
Wait!!

5514
03:14:09,290 --> 03:14:10,040
A lot of practice must have been done

5515
03:14:10,040 --> 03:14:13,380
A lot of practice must have been done

5516
03:14:14,900 --> 03:14:16,850
Let's get into the patrol car

5517
03:14:30,550 --> 03:14:32,950
Arrested!!

5518
03:14:30,550 --> 03:14:32,950
Arrested!!

5519
03:14:37,750 --> 03:14:40,740
This is something I would pay money to watch

5520
03:14:44,590 --> 03:14:45,110
I want to go watch this at a live event or something

5521
03:14:45,110 --> 03:14:47,280
I want to go watch this at a live event or something

5522
03:14:47,300 --> 03:14:48,500
Inspector, let us bring him in

5523
03:14:48,500 --> 03:14:49,820
Inspector, let us bring him in

5524
03:14:50,870 --> 03:14:55,140
Incident of the Stolen new robot: resolved!!

5525
03:14:55,740 --> 03:14:58,290
I couldn't really process what happened

5526
03:14:57,060 --> 03:14:58,290
yeah

5527
03:15:02,110 --> 03:15:03,080
It was amazing: that high level of completion!!

5528
03:15:03,080 --> 03:15:05,850
It was amazing: that high level of completion!!

5529
03:15:07,280 --> 03:15:09,020
6:30 pm

5530
03:15:07,670 --> 03:15:12,290
Science laboratory 10 hours 30 minutes since the start

5531
03:15:09,600 --> 03:15:12,290
Matsumoto has found something which caught his attention

5532
03:15:14,520 --> 03:15:16,360
Look at this;

5533
03:15:14,520 --> 03:15:16,360
doesn't this remind you of something?

5534
03:15:16,790 --> 03:15:19,430
This usage of colours...

5535
03:15:19,480 --> 03:15:20,280
Ah, wait a moment

5536
03:15:20,100 --> 03:15:21,230
This usage of colour

5537
03:15:21,400 --> 03:15:22,500
Usage of colours...

5538
03:15:23,420 --> 03:15:24,180
Right

5539
03:15:24,030 --> 03:15:39,250
Q. what do you think of when you look at these colours?

5540
03:15:25,920 --> 03:15:26,840
it's remarkable

5541
03:15:26,840 --> 03:15:28,340
how that object caught my eye

5542
03:15:28,070 --> 03:15:29,740
Cleaning robot

5543
03:15:30,210 --> 03:15:31,410
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

5544
03:15:32,610 --> 03:15:33,690
Can I say it?

5545
03:15:33,790 --> 03:15:34,330
Go ahead

5546
03:15:43,540 --> 03:15:46,240
What's this guy doing?

5547
03:15:46,490 --> 03:15:48,810
Even though we can't laugh

5548
03:15:50,330 --> 03:15:52,830
so this did happen

5549
03:15:52,330 --> 03:15:53,960
smiling and jumping in joy like that

5550
03:15:56,080 --> 03:15:57,270
Even though we can't laugh

5551
03:15:57,370 --> 03:15:57,800
even so

5552
03:15:57,870 --> 03:16:00,390
Matsumoto-san,

5553
03:15:57,870 --> 03:16:00,390
it's a super good quiz

5554
03:16:00,640 --> 03:16:02,140
Look at this colour

5555
03:16:02,190 --> 03:16:03,040
The colour? Not the shape?

5556
03:16:03,040 --> 03:16:06,110
The colour? Not the shape?

5557
03:16:03,570 --> 03:16:05,810
The colour's quite spot-on

5558
03:16:06,410 --> 03:16:07,330
I know the answer too

5559
03:16:06,410 --> 03:16:11,760
※Everyone, please think of the answer along with them

5560
03:16:06,410 --> 03:16:33,820
Q. What does this colour remind you of?

5561
03:16:07,410 --> 03:16:08,560
Whisper it

5562
03:16:08,910 --> 03:16:10,630
Will Tanaka get the correct answer?

5563
03:16:10,750 --> 03:16:11,230
How will he do?

5564
03:16:11,230 --> 03:16:11,780
The colour...

5565
03:16:18,990 --> 03:16:20,970
I have no idea

5566
03:16:20,690 --> 03:16:24,640
Hamada-san's probably a little distanced from it

5567
03:16:23,290 --> 03:16:24,640
I don't think so

5568
03:16:24,660 --> 03:16:25,480
because his children have all grown up

5569
03:16:25,480 --> 03:16:26,480
because his children have all grown up

5570
03:16:26,800 --> 03:16:27,680
Endo!!

5571
03:16:28,600 --> 03:16:29,350
I get it! I get it!

5572
03:16:29,350 --> 03:16:29,880
I get it! I get it!

5573
03:16:30,180 --> 03:16:31,800
It's the future for Endo (with his new kid)

5574
03:16:31,770 --> 03:16:32,620
Yes...

5575
03:16:34,170 --> 03:16:35,050
Just the colour right?

5576
03:16:35,640 --> 03:16:35,990
eh?

5577
03:16:37,870 --> 03:16:39,210
Baikinman

5578
03:16:40,790 --> 03:16:51,400
reminded of

5579
03:16:40,990 --> 03:16:51,400
T/N: Baikinman is a character in the anime "Anpanman". "Baikin"（ばい菌） means germs or bacteria.

5580
03:16:40,990 --> 03:16:51,400
baikinman

5581
03:16:42,860 --> 03:16:43,630
Ah the colour

5582
03:16:43,650 --> 03:16:44,660
You gotta be kidding?

5583
03:16:44,680 --> 03:16:48,030
No, I really have no idea

5584
03:16:45,700 --> 03:16:47,230
Seriously?

5585
03:16:46,250 --> 03:16:47,230
At all?

5586
03:16:48,050 --> 03:16:49,900
I don't get what you're

5587
03:16:48,050 --> 03:16:49,900
talking about at all

5588
03:16:49,920 --> 03:16:51,400
This is a big hint

5589
03:16:51,640 --> 03:17:04,050
Is Hamada able to recall 「baikinman」 from this?

5590
03:16:56,010 --> 03:16:57,990
a i u e o

5591
03:16:58,480 --> 03:17:04,050
Hint: the 50 sounds of Japanese

5592
03:17:00,410 --> 03:17:02,200
No... not even a millimeter

5593
03:17:02,800 --> 03:17:03,630
Seriously?

5594
03:17:04,070 --> 03:17:04,650
Say a i u e o in a more...

5595
03:17:04,650 --> 03:17:07,450
Say a i u e o in a more...

5596
03:17:07,470 --> 03:17:08,790
Say it more energetically

5597
03:17:09,220 --> 03:17:09,890
eh?

5598
03:17:16,560 --> 03:17:17,360
The rule is a little difficult

5599
03:17:17,880 --> 03:17:18,980
No way!

5600
03:17:20,420 --> 03:17:21,800
I seriously don't get what you're talking about

5601
03:17:21,800 --> 03:17:23,400
I seriously don't get what you're talking about

5602
03:17:23,420 --> 03:17:25,890
with high excitement

5603
03:17:25,890 --> 03:17:27,240
Can you please say it?

5604
03:17:27,470 --> 03:17:56,320
Is Hamada able to recall 「baikinman」from this?

5605
03:17:28,760 --> 03:17:30,980
a i u e ooo!!

5606
03:17:31,010 --> 03:17:33,650
and next  is?

5607
03:17:34,630 --> 03:17:36,200
ka ki ku ke kooo!!

5608
03:17:36,180 --> 03:17:37,070
Yes, yes

5609
03:17:37,900 --> 03:17:39,570
sa shi su se sooo!!

5610
03:17:39,920 --> 03:17:40,990
Yes, that's it

5611
03:17:42,790 --> 03:17:45,510
ta chi tsu te tooo!!

5612
03:17:45,860 --> 03:17:49,080
na ni nu ne nooo!!

5613
03:17:49,380 --> 03:17:49,780
Huh? What comes next?

5614
03:17:49,780 --> 03:17:50,930
Huh? What comes next?

5615
03:17:50,930 --> 03:17:52,850
You're already very close

5616
03:17:51,810 --> 03:17:52,550
Yeah, close

5617
03:17:52,830 --> 03:17:53,320
You can do it

5618
03:17:53,330 --> 03:17:53,730
That's it

5619
03:17:53,750 --> 03:17:56,320
ha hi fu he hooo!!

5620
03:17:57,620 --> 03:17:58,840
ma mi mu me mooo!!

5621
03:18:08,530 --> 03:18:09,500
Wait a minute

5622
03:18:09,500 --> 03:18:10,820
Hamada...

5623
03:18:11,700 --> 03:18:13,490
Well, there are times it's a generation gap, however, it's been a long time since it started

5624
03:18:13,490 --> 03:18:16,810
Well, there are times it's a generation gap, however, it's been a long time since it  started

5625
03:18:16,770 --> 03:18:18,760
So even if you say that...

5626
03:18:16,770 --> 03:18:18,760
The gap

5627
03:18:19,410 --> 03:18:20,510
Yeah I understand

5628
03:18:21,580 --> 03:18:23,400
Well, it can't be helped, right?

5629
03:18:23,660 --> 03:18:24,060
Now, the answer's ha hi fu he ho

5630
03:18:24,060 --> 03:18:25,030
Now, the answer's ha hi fu he ho

5631
03:18:25,030 --> 03:18:26,700
Now, the answer's ha hi fu he ho

5632
03:18:27,750 --> 03:18:28,700
(ha hi fu he ho): say it energetically

5633
03:18:28,700 --> 03:18:30,240
(ha hi fu he ho): say it energetically

5634
03:18:30,450 --> 03:18:54,290
Is Hamada able to recall 「baikinman」from this?

5635
03:18:31,500 --> 03:18:32,690
energetically..?

5636
03:18:33,960 --> 03:18:35,960
ha hi fu he hooo!!

5637
03:18:36,610 --> 03:18:38,440
it's a little...

5638
03:18:37,730 --> 03:18:38,440
What do you mean..?

5639
03:18:38,760 --> 03:18:39,730
I want a tune  set to it

5640
03:18:39,730 --> 03:18:41,780
I want a tune set to it

5641
03:18:41,230 --> 03:18:43,230

03:18:43,620 --> 03:18:45,180
ha hi fu he hoo

5643
03:18:47,290 --> 03:18:48,890
Say that line like

5644
03:18:48,990 --> 03:18:50,420
Like Akko-san

5645
03:18:49,140 --> 03:18:54,290
Hint: say 「ha hi fu he ho」

5646
03:18:49,140 --> 03:18:54,290
T/N: Wada Akiko is a famous singer & variety show host. "Akko" is her nickname

5647
03:18:49,140 --> 03:18:54,290
like Wada Akiko

5648
03:18:51,690 --> 03:18:53,610
how about it?

5649
03:18:54,340 --> 03:18:55,480
how about trying it

5650
03:18:56,030 --> 03:18:56,910
Like Akko-san?

5651
03:18:56,910 --> 03:18:58,900
haa hi fu he hoo

5652
03:18:58,510 --> 03:18:59,300
yes

5653
03:19:03,450 --> 03:19:04,790
No, even if you look at me like that...

5654
03:19:04,950 --> 03:19:05,890
You just said it, just about.

5655
03:19:05,890 --> 03:19:07,210
You just said it, just about.

5656
03:19:08,210 --> 03:19:09,560
Combine that with this please

5657
03:19:10,180 --> 03:19:10,590
this

5658
03:19:10,690 --> 03:19:11,410
This colour

5659
03:19:11,040 --> 03:19:11,510
with this

5660
03:19:13,760 --> 03:19:15,780
It's okay, say it

5661
03:19:17,080 --> 03:19:18,400
Even if you say that...

5662
03:19:19,520 --> 03:19:22,290
What does ha hi fu he hoo have

5663
03:19:20,740 --> 03:19:21,020
to do with this?

5664
03:19:21,020 --> 03:19:22,290
to do with this?

5665
03:19:27,390 --> 03:19:29,080
this is seriously...

5666
03:19:32,580 --> 03:19:33,670
No way!!

5667
03:19:33,670 --> 03:19:35,030
Seriously!?

5668
03:19:35,030 --> 03:19:36,220
I think he knew the answer...

5669
03:19:36,220 --> 03:19:37,070
Everyone else knew

5670
03:19:38,970 --> 03:19:51,620
Is Hamada able to recall 「baikinman」from this?

5671
03:19:42,110 --> 03:19:46,380
Hint: Bye bye OO~

5672
03:19:43,310 --> 03:19:44,440
Bye bye~

5673
03:19:44,490 --> 03:19:45,630
Bye bye~

5674
03:19:52,850 --> 03:19:53,470
No, even if you look at me like that...

5675
03:19:53,700 --> 03:19:54,320
I now feel like crying

5676
03:19:54,320 --> 03:19:56,960
I now feel like crying

5677
03:19:57,170 --> 03:19:58,660
My face is wet with tears

5678
03:19:58,660 --> 03:20:00,360
My face is wet with tears

5679
03:20:01,360 --> 03:20:03,630
I feel powerless

5680
03:20:03,600 --> 03:20:04,380
we have to change it

5681
03:20:04,380 --> 03:20:05,380
yeah

5682
03:20:04,830 --> 03:20:24,920
Is Hamada able to recall 「baikinman」from this?

5683
03:20:06,770 --> 03:20:07,970
because Matsumoto's tired

5684
03:20:09,020 --> 03:20:09,270
I'm too tired

5685
03:20:09,850 --> 03:20:11,440
exhausted

5686
03:20:11,840 --> 03:20:12,490
this is bad

5687
03:20:15,760 --> 03:20:15,840
Ah! Something from Anpanman?

5688
03:20:15,840 --> 03:20:18,280
Ah! Something from Anpanman?

5689
03:20:21,460 --> 03:20:22,900
You were referring to a character?

5690
03:20:23,230 --> 03:20:24,720
from Anpanman?

5691
03:20:23,830 --> 03:20:24,920
Yes that's right

5692
03:20:25,020 --> 03:20:25,750
Ahhh! So that's it!!

5693
03:20:25,750 --> 03:20:27,750
Ahhh! So that's it!!

5694
03:20:27,620 --> 03:20:29,640
Who?

5695
03:20:28,170 --> 03:20:29,640
No idea.

5696
03:20:35,130 --> 03:20:36,710
8 o'clock P.M.

5697
03:20:35,610 --> 03:20:40,220
Science lab - 12 hours in

5698
03:20:36,710 --> 03:20:40,480
There is trouble stirring up in the laboratories

5699
03:20:42,950 --> 03:20:44,620
Everyone, trouble!

5700
03:20:44,620 --> 03:20:47,790
Some people who have complaints about our lab came over, so we

5701
03:20:46,420 --> 03:20:47,790
have to check what's going on.

5702
03:20:47,790 --> 03:20:49,460
Other scientists are involved;

5703
03:20:49,760 --> 03:20:53,360
we have to break the fight up!!

5704
03:20:50,980 --> 03:20:52,380
That serious?

5705
03:20:52,310 --> 03:20:53,380
Let's go, guys

5706
03:20:53,380 --> 03:20:55,130
That has nothing to do with research...

5707
03:20:53,860 --> 03:21:01,800
The five have to intervene.

5708
03:20:53,860 --> 03:21:01,800
Hooligans have invaded the labs.

5709
03:20:54,060 --> 03:20:55,350
It's not related!

5710
03:20:54,900 --> 03:20:56,130
Some people...

5711
03:20:57,530 --> 03:21:00,750
Why don't they leave that stuff to the security police!?

5712
03:20:57,580 --> 03:20:58,920
Just let them be!

5713
03:21:00,750 --> 03:21:01,750
Let's go together

5714
03:21:04,610 --> 03:21:06,240
I hear something.

5715
03:21:06,240 --> 03:21:08,830
That's enough!

5716
03:21:06,460 --> 03:21:11,650
Laboratory corridor

5717
03:21:07,190 --> 03:21:08,740
They're doing something

5718
03:21:07,340 --> 03:21:08,830
Do it firmly, you!

5719
03:21:08,830 --> 03:21:10,550
Stop playing around

5720
03:21:10,550 --> 03:21:12,350
I am being serious.

5721
03:21:11,400 --> 03:21:15,550
You're not being serious!

5722
03:21:11,650 --> 03:21:15,670
Hooligan

5723
03:21:11,650 --> 03:21:15,670
Scientist

5724
03:21:11,650 --> 03:21:15,670
Succhii

5725
03:21:11,650 --> 03:21:15,670
Yutaka Yoshida

5726
03:21:15,620 --> 03:21:17,990
What the hell is this!?

5727
03:21:16,470 --> 03:21:18,540
I am doing my best

5728
03:21:18,540 --> 03:21:20,320
What is this!?

5729
03:21:19,540 --> 03:21:21,260
I am sorry!

5730
03:21:21,260 --> 03:21:24,890
We don't know what happened,

5731
03:21:22,490 --> 03:21:24,890
but could you please let us off?

5732
03:21:23,780 --> 03:21:25,930
This is pissing me off

5733
03:21:26,030 --> 03:21:28,300
Got a problem?!

5734
03:21:28,230 --> 03:21:30,150
What is it? Go away!

5735
03:21:28,300 --> 03:21:35,400
Hooligan cannot contain his anger.

5736
03:21:30,150 --> 03:21:31,730
Shut up, stupid!

5737
03:21:31,730 --> 03:21:33,570
This lab is too loud, and I can't sleep!

5738
03:21:32,620 --> 03:21:34,350
His voice is so loud

5739
03:21:33,570 --> 03:21:35,450
This lab is too loud, and I can't sleep!

5740
03:21:35,570 --> 03:21:37,270
Show me the real deal!!

5741
03:21:37,540 --> 03:21:40,380
Show me the real stuff, I said! Get it?!

5742
03:21:41,930 --> 03:21:45,330
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey

5743
03:21:42,040 --> 03:21:46,880
"Yoshimoto Shinkigeki" piece "Nipple drill"

5744
03:21:42,040 --> 03:21:46,880
Note: "Yoshimoto Shinkigeki" is a comedy theater show

5745
03:21:45,330 --> 03:21:46,530
Hey you, what are you doing!?

5746
03:21:46,530 --> 03:21:47,550
Hey you, what are you doing!?

5747
03:21:50,070 --> 03:21:51,390
Won't you come!?

5748
03:21:51,790 --> 03:21:53,090
Will you come or won't you come, will you come or won't you come

5749
03:21:53,090 --> 03:21:54,210
Will you come or won't you come, will you come or won't you come

5750
03:21:54,210 --> 03:21:55,110
Will you come or won't you come, will you come orwon't you come

5751
03:21:55,110 --> 03:21:56,510
Will you come or won't you come, will you come or won't you come

5752
03:21:56,510 --> 03:21:58,380
SAY SOMETHING, YOU!

5753
03:22:00,400 --> 03:22:01,930
Don't hit my toes.

5754
03:22:01,930 --> 03:22:03,130
I said, Don't hit my toes.

5755
03:22:03,130 --> 03:22:04,630
Not the chin!

5756
03:22:04,630 --> 03:22:05,720
Not the chin!

5757
03:22:05,920 --> 03:22:06,370
Not my armpit!

5758
03:22:06,370 --> 03:22:06,820
Not my armpit!

5759
03:22:06,820 --> 03:22:07,500
Not my armpit!

5760
03:22:07,620 --> 03:22:11,570
The place where there are a lot of capillary vessels

5761
03:22:09,890 --> 03:22:10,020
armpit!

5762
03:22:10,020 --> 03:22:11,570
armpit!

5763
03:22:12,410 --> 03:22:17,100
The place where there are a lot of capillary vessels

5764
03:22:14,860 --> 03:22:14,990
armpit!

5765
03:22:14,990 --> 03:22:17,100
armpit!

5766
03:22:17,350 --> 03:22:21,920
The place where there are a lot of capillary vessels

5767
03:22:19,850 --> 03:22:20,230
armpits!

5768
03:22:20,230 --> 03:22:21,920
armpits!

5769
03:22:21,920 --> 03:22:23,220
Can't you hear!? We're this close!

5770
03:22:23,220 --> 03:22:24,700
Can't you hear!? We're this close!

5771
03:22:24,820 --> 03:22:26,490
"The place where there are a lot of capillary vessels  armpit"

5772
03:22:26,490 --> 03:22:31,590
"The place where there are a lot of capillary vessels  armpit,"

5773
03:22:27,120 --> 03:22:31,590
it's difficult to hear that.

5774
03:22:28,360 --> 03:22:31,590
That's what I said!

5775
03:22:29,560 --> 03:22:31,610
You did manage to hear all that, didn't you!?

5776
03:22:31,610 --> 03:22:32,480
What's wrong with you!?

5777
03:22:32,480 --> 03:22:34,260
Don't drill my nipples!

5778
03:22:34,530 --> 03:22:36,300
Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't!

Toes, chin, armpit STOP!

5796
03:22:51,700 --> 03:22:54,320
Aren't you gonna do the drill!!?

5797

Aren't you gonna do the drill!!?

5800

Will you or won't you do the drill, will you or won't you do the drill?

Will you or won't you do the drill, will you or won't you do the drill?

03:27:31,360 --> 03:27:34,430
Wha... hey...will you powder?

5994
03:27:32,380 --> 03:27:34,130
Will you powder?

5995
03:27:35,300 --> 03:27:36,550
Nipple... stop...

5996
03:27:36,550 --> 03:27:38,770
Nipple... stop...

5997
03:27:39,370 --> 03:27:40,350
Don't,  don't, don't, don't

5998
03:27:40,350 --> 03:27:41,400
Don't, don't, don't, don't

5999
03:27:41,270 --> 03:27:44,770
For real, was he okay?

6000
03:27:41,300 --> 03:27:42,470
This is ridiculous!!

6001
03:27:41,400 --> 03:27:42,300
Don't, don't, don't, don't

6002
03:27:42,300 --> 03:27:43,490
Don't, don't, don't, don't

6003
03:27:42,470 --> 03:27:44,060
This is ridiculous!!

6004
03:27:43,490 --> 03:27:44,210
Don't, don't, don't, don't

6005
03:27:44,210 --> 03:27:45,110
Don't, don't, don't, don't

6006
03:27:44,770 --> 03:27:46,160
This is really bad

6007
03:27:45,110 --> 03:27:46,110
Don't, don't, don't, don't

6008
03:27:46,110 --> 03:27:46,960
Don't, don't, don't, don't

6009
03:27:46,160 --> 03:27:47,740
This one was bad, yeah

6010
03:27:46,310 --> 03:27:48,540
He didn't say "drill" even a single time

6011
03:27:46,960 --> 03:27:47,710
Don't, don't, don't, don't

6012
03:27:47,710 --> 03:27:48,510
Don't, don't,  don't, don't

6013
03:27:48,510 --> 03:27:49,210
Don't, don't, don't, don't

6014
03:27:48,810 --> 03:27:49,280
It's important, it's important.

6015
03:27:49,210 --> 03:27:49,910
Don't, don't, don't, don't

6016
03:27:49,280 --> 03:27:50,800
It's important, it's important.

6017
03:27:49,910 --> 03:27:50,800
Don't, don't, don't, don't

6018
03:27:50,800 --> 03:27:51,550
Don't, don't, don't, don't

6019
03:27:51,550 --> 03:27:52,250
Don't, don't, don't, don't

6020
03:27:52,250 --> 03:27:52,950
Don't, don't, don't, don't

6021
03:27:52,980 --> 03:27:58,020
Toes...

6022
03:27:53,480 --> 03:27:58,020
chun,

6023
03:27:53,750 --> 03:27:58,020
Um

6024
03:27:54,220 --> 03:27:58,020
won't you

6025
03:27:54,680 --> 03:27:54,970
do it!!

6026
03:27:54,970 --> 03:27:58,020
do it!!

6027
03:27:58,020 --> 03:27:59,120
Not right at all!

6028
03:27:59,120 --> 03:28:00,220
Let's go

6029
03:28:00,220 --> 03:28:01,360
That's bad!!

6030
03:28:00,990 --> 03:28:02,210
Nope

6031
03:28:02,120 --> 03:28:03,290
That was bad

6032
03:28:06,230 --> 03:28:08,230
Well that was a given...

6033
03:28:07,310 --> 03:28:09,700
Of course...

6034
03:28:07,310 --> 03:28:09,700
To think there'd be a continuation

6035
03:28:08,460 --> 03:28:12,600
If Tokuma-san  was like that...

6036
03:28:10,450 --> 03:28:11,980
That was bound to happen

6037
03:28:11,320 --> 03:28:12,450
Tokuma-san was amazing...

6038
03:28:16,140 --> 03:28:18,370
We were shown something good

6039
03:28:18,370 --> 03:28:21,780
Cheered  us up.

6040
03:28:18,810 --> 03:28:20,560
Yes, truly

6041
03:28:23,330 --> 03:28:27,480
Just over 12 hours in, the new professors have a new task

6042
03:28:23,580 --> 03:28:28,350
8:30pm Science Research Lab: 12hrs 30 min of service

6043
03:28:28,780 --> 03:28:36,890
Conducting Social Studies Research

6044
03:28:28,780 --> 03:28:36,890
Participating in a Scientific Seminar!!

6045
03:28:29,370 --> 03:28:32,670
They will participate in their senior scientists' seminar

6046
03:28:37,010 --> 03:28:38,730
Could I have you sit here?

6047
03:28:38,740 --> 03:28:40,580
Matsumoto, Hamada...

6048
03:28:44,780 --> 03:28:49,670
I'd like to commence the Gasukurobikari Research Institute's faculty meeting

6049
03:28:50,240 --> 03:28:52,740
Just to confirm today's topic,

6050
03:28:53,260 --> 03:28:55,860
we are here to discuss our ecologic findings from studying

6051
03:28:53,880 --> 03:29:03,150
Academics share their findings

6052
03:28:53,880 --> 03:29:03,150
Famous People Ecology Report

6053
03:28:53,880 --> 03:29:03,150
Research institute faculty meeting

6054
03:28:53,880 --> 03:29:03,150
m 0 0 l 1009.5 0 l 1009.5 195 l 0 195 l 0 0

6055
03:28:55,880 --> 03:28:57,280
famous people's everyday lives

6056
03:28:57,710 --> 03:28:59,830
This is the place to share your findings

6057
03:29:00,620 --> 03:29:02,350
Let's begin immediately

6058
03:29:02,770 --> 03:29:03,700
Who wants to go first?

6059
03:29:04,140 --> 03:29:04,470
I'll go

6060
03:29:04,790 --> 03:29:05,550
Katsumata

6061
03:29:06,190 --> 03:29:07,740
Concerning Tsukitei Housei

6062
03:29:08,590 --> 03:29:11,130
Tsukitei Housei's forever-loved show

6063
03:29:09,310 --> 03:29:18,800
An important regular show

6064
03:29:09,310 --> 03:29:18,800
Tsukitei Housei's Scoop

6065
03:29:11,480 --> 03:29:13,790
"Drive-A-Go! Go!"

6066
03:29:13,790 --> 03:29:14,980
considered his life's work

6067
03:29:14,980 --> 03:29:16,810
"Drive-A-Go! Go!"

6068
03:29:16,810 --> 03:29:18,800
has ended this year.

6069
03:29:23,050 --> 03:29:24,140
It ended?

6070
03:29:24,140 --> 03:29:25,870
"Drive-A-Go! Go!" ended?

6071
03:29:27,310 --> 03:29:27,810
Their car was confiscated.

6072
03:29:27,810 --> 03:29:29,790
Their car was confiscated.

6073
03:29:29,790 --> 03:29:31,050
Everyone loved that show!

6074
03:29:32,960 --> 03:29:34,320
I'd certainly like to ride it again

6075
03:29:34,350 --> 03:29:35,170
Anything else?

6076
03:29:35,420 --> 03:29:37,600
Some study of Hamada revealed

6077
03:29:36,530 --> 03:29:59,370
Hamada's Scoop

6078
03:29:36,530 --> 03:29:59,370
His favorite commercial

6079
03:29:37,600 --> 03:29:41,290
that he has a favorite commercial I think everyone knows:

6080
03:29:41,510 --> 03:29:46,540
An Amazon ad where a baby and the dog wear a lion's mane

6081
03:29:46,840 --> 03:29:48,250
It's an amazing ad

6082
03:29:48,380 --> 03:29:49,110
Hamada really loves that ad

6083
03:29:49,110 --> 03:29:50,800
Hamada really loves that ad

6084
03:29:50,800 --> 03:29:52,730
No matter what, if he's eating his favourite food,

6085
03:29:52,730 --> 03:29:54,490
if he's in an important meeting,

6086
03:29:54,490 --> 03:29:54,870
if someone  screams "AAAAAAH" in his face,

6087
03:29:54,870 --> 03:29:55,370
if someone screams "AAAAAAH"  in his face,

6088
03:29:55,370 --> 03:29:56,150
if someone screams "AAAAAAH" in his face,

6089
03:29:56,150 --> 03:29:57,670
the second that ad comes on,

6090
03:29:57,940 --> 03:29:59,370
he's lost in his own world staring at it

6091
03:30:02,360 --> 03:30:04,810
That's so creepy

6092
03:30:06,110 --> 03:30:07,670
Creepy!

6093
03:30:08,020 --> 03:30:08,920
That's adorable!

6094
03:30:11,520 --> 03:30:14,660
That's just so creepy

6095
03:30:12,490 --> 03:30:14,660
Get over it already

6096
03:30:15,510 --> 03:30:16,920
He's so kindhearted

6097
03:30:17,290 --> 03:30:19,060
What's with you guys?

6098
03:30:19,060 --> 03:30:21,450
Speaking of Hamada's kindhearted nature,

6099
03:30:21,830 --> 03:30:23,660
I've got a matter that I couldn't comprehend

6100
03:30:23,610 --> 03:31:01,020
Hamada's Scoop

6101
03:30:23,610 --> 03:31:01,020
Osaka Program

6102
03:30:23,660 --> 03:30:25,100
A program based in Osaka

6103
03:30:25,100 --> 03:30:26,830
it was Hamada's program.

6104
03:30:26,880 --> 03:30:28,890
He had a plan to give one of his viewers

6105
03:30:28,890 --> 03:30:31,240
a Christmas present from my home

6106
03:30:31,240 --> 03:30:33,120
a Christmas present from my home

6107
03:30:33,120 --> 03:30:34,530
Hamada came knocking with a bang

6108
03:30:34,530 --> 03:30:36,390
"Hey! I came to pick up the present!"

6109
03:30:36,390 --> 03:30:38,100
along with his understudies "The Missile Men"

6110
03:30:38,260 --> 03:30:40,260
He came in with dirty shoes on, of course

6111
03:30:40,260 --> 03:30:42,450
"Gonna take something with value, k?"

6112
03:30:42,680 --> 03:30:44,620
He brings this $800 T-Fal,

6113
03:30:44,620 --> 03:30:46,200
some kind of kitchen goods

6114
03:30:46,200 --> 03:30:48,220
Completely unused "I'm taking this"

6115
03:30:48,590 --> 03:30:49,770
like "No, not that!"

6116
03:30:49,770 --> 03:30:51,060
going with the flow the "Missile Men" say "we'll take this too"

6117
03:30:51,060 --> 03:30:52,060
going with the flow the "Missile Men" say "we'll take this too"

6118
03:30:52,060 --> 03:30:53,540
They pick this Doraemon Mahjong game my kid has been constantly playing with

6119
03:30:53,540 --> 03:30:55,330
They pick this Doraemon Mahjong game my kid has been constantly playing with

6120
03:30:55,410 --> 03:30:56,360
But then, Hamada's like

6121
03:30:56,910 --> 03:30:58,020
"Don't be taking away his kid's childhood memories!"

6122
03:30:58,020 --> 03:30:58,550
"Don't be taking away his kid's childhood memories!"

6123
03:30:58,550 --> 03:31:01,020
"Don't be taking away his kid's childhood memories!"

6124
03:31:01,740 --> 03:31:03,300
So kind!

6125
03:31:09,180 --> 03:31:10,860
I wish he had followed through

6126
03:31:10,390 --> 03:31:10,860
So in the end, they just take the $800 T-Fal kitchen thing

6127
03:31:10,860 --> 03:31:13,510
So in the end, they just take the $800 T-Fal kitchen thing

6128
03:31:13,510 --> 03:31:17,180
and laughing on the way out they left.

6129
03:31:17,870 --> 03:31:18,970
So kind!

6130
03:31:20,920 --> 03:31:21,260
Daigo

6131
03:31:21,670 --> 03:31:26,190
Uh... I just relaxed a bit, er, really just realized that

6132
03:31:24,290 --> 03:31:49,270
Hamada's Scoop

6133
03:31:24,290 --> 03:31:49,270
Osaka Program Part 2

6134
03:31:27,240 --> 03:31:29,610
When Hamada went to Nobu's house and took an item for a show

6135
03:31:29,610 --> 03:31:32,470
When Hamada went to Nobu's house and took an item for a show

6136
03:31:32,470 --> 03:31:34,220
I wasn't there for that...

6137
03:31:34,470 --> 03:31:35,170
yet

6138
03:31:35,490 --> 03:31:37,250
last time I met Hamada

6139
03:31:37,670 --> 03:31:38,940
he had his mouth agape

6140
03:31:38,940 --> 03:31:40,120
I said "yeah?"

6141
03:31:40,120 --> 03:31:41,960
and mouth still open he says "Gimme something"

6142
03:31:41,960 --> 03:31:44,900
and mouth still open he says "Gimme something"

6143
03:31:45,030 --> 03:31:46,260
Now that I think about it,after getting Nobu he went after me

6144
03:31:46,260 --> 03:31:49,270
Now that I think about it, after getting Nobu he went after me

6145
03:31:51,190 --> 03:31:53,200
Like I would know

6146
03:31:51,190 --> 03:31:53,200
Maybe it was a mistake?

6147
03:31:58,190 --> 03:31:59,140
That's no mistake

6148
03:32:00,930 --> 03:32:01,630
I don't get it

6149
03:32:01,730 --> 03:32:02,760
he said "Gimme something"

6150
03:32:02,810 --> 03:32:03,510
Throughout the whole thing, he never closed his mouth once

6151
03:32:03,510 --> 03:32:04,650
Throughout the whole thing, he never closed his mouth once

6152
03:32:04,750 --> 03:32:05,830
"Gim sumtin!"

6153
03:32:07,770 --> 03:32:08,790
Like some kind of ventriloquist act I've never seen before

6154
03:32:08,790 --> 03:32:11,170
Like some kind of ventriloquist act I've never seen before

6155
03:32:11,170 --> 03:32:12,560
"Gim sumn!"

6156
03:32:12,610 --> 03:32:14,110
That's not relevant

6157
03:32:14,630 --> 03:32:15,340
What's the point

6158
03:32:15,730 --> 03:32:17,950
He just keeps going with his mouth open?

6159
03:32:19,860 --> 03:32:20,510
It's like when he's not on TV, he can't close his mouth!

6160
03:32:20,510 --> 03:32:23,380
It's like when he's not on TV, he can't close his mouth!

6161
03:32:25,220 --> 03:32:26,750
Can't close his mouth?

6162
03:32:26,750 --> 03:32:28,310
What's with this story

6163
03:32:33,640 --> 03:32:35,010
That's so weird

6164
03:32:36,410 --> 03:32:39,150
I've got something on Hamada too

6165
03:32:39,150 --> 03:32:43,200
His kindness, his likeness to gorillas, and many other descriptions

6166
03:32:43,500 --> 03:32:46,170
After 23 persistent years the untouchable Shibata

6167
03:32:46,170 --> 03:32:48,180
got to do a remote shoot with Hamada

6168
03:32:46,320 --> 03:33:20,220
Hamada's Scoop

6169
03:32:46,320 --> 03:33:20,220
Shoot of his dreams

6170
03:32:49,030 --> 03:32:50,540
and it was his dream

6171
03:32:50,540 --> 03:32:51,400
to have Hamada hit him over the head

6172
03:32:51,400 --> 03:32:51,800
to have Hamada hit him over the head

6173
03:32:51,800 --> 03:32:52,400
to have Hamada hit him over the head

6174
03:32:52,400 --> 03:32:53,460
to have Hamada hit him over the head

6175
03:32:53,510 --> 03:32:54,600
cause he's famous

6176
03:32:55,600 --> 03:32:56,680
We were filming at a zoo

6177
03:32:56,680 --> 03:32:59,300
and Shibata is telling various stories about the animals

6178
03:32:59,300 --> 03:33:00,450
The animals weren't very excited and wouldn't come over to Hamada

6179
03:33:00,450 --> 03:33:01,040
The animals weren't very excited and wouldn't come over to Hamada

6180
03:33:01,490 --> 03:33:02,390
The ONLY animal to come over was a gorilla

6181
03:33:02,390 --> 03:33:03,620
The ONLY animal to come over was a gorilla

6182
03:33:03,620 --> 03:33:04,810
The ONLY animal to come over was a gorilla

6183
03:33:05,090 --> 03:33:07,040
It's like gorilla, Hamada, gorilla, Hamada

6184
03:33:07,040 --> 03:33:08,780
like passing through a mirror or glass

6185
03:33:09,180 --> 03:33:09,810
I thought "This is my chance! I can't miss this!"

6186
03:33:09,810 --> 03:33:11,200
I thought "This is my chance! I can't miss this!"

6187
03:33:11,200 --> 03:33:12,600
I said "As expected, you're similar types" to try and set him up

6188
03:33:12,600 --> 03:33:13,580
I said "As expected, you're similar types" to try and set him up

6189
03:33:13,880 --> 03:33:15,940
Just as I expect him to give a strong hit

6190
03:33:15,390 --> 03:33:16,350
Cause of what you said...

6191
03:33:16,200 --> 03:33:16,600
Right!

6192
03:33:17,000 --> 03:33:17,670
He gently remarks with a smile, "You're so annoying"

6193
03:33:17,670 --> 03:33:18,360
He gently remarks with a smile, "You're so annoying"

6194
03:33:18,360 --> 03:33:20,220
He gently remarks with a smile, "You're so annoying"

6195
03:33:21,840 --> 03:33:23,890
He's so kind!

6196
03:33:24,480 --> 03:33:25,810
Completely kindhearted

6197
03:33:28,250 --> 03:33:29,630
I mean, who wouldn't think they're similar

6198
03:33:30,630 --> 03:33:32,440
He grinned out of embarrassment too...

6199
03:33:34,050 --> 03:33:37,440
While we're discussing Hamada, his age is starting to show...

6200
03:33:35,640 --> 03:34:10,570
Hamada's Scoop

6201
03:33:35,640 --> 03:34:10,570
Signs of Aging

6202
03:33:37,790 --> 03:33:39,540
I keep bringing this up every time, but...

6203
03:33:40,040 --> 03:33:41,480
From his kitchen

6204
03:33:41,980 --> 03:33:45,170
there's this hallway in Hamada's house

6205
03:33:46,230 --> 03:33:47,770
with a bathroom and a closet for water storage in the same direction

6206
03:33:47,770 --> 03:33:50,400
with a bathroom and a closet for water storage in the same direction

6207
03:33:50,400 --> 03:33:51,990
with a bathroom and a closet for water storage in the same direction

6208
03:33:52,210 --> 03:33:54,810
and he's hobbling along

6209
03:33:54,810 --> 03:33:56,030
I'm sure he went to get some water, but

6210
03:33:56,030 --> 03:33:58,380
I'm sure he went  to get some water, but

6211
03:33:58,380 --> 03:33:59,410
He forgot, and instead went to the bathroom in the same area

6212
03:33:59,410 --> 03:34:00,410
He forgot, and instead went to the bathroom in the same area

6213
03:34:00,410 --> 03:34:03,130
He forgot, and instead went to the bathroom in the same area

6214
03:34:03,680 --> 03:34:05,400
Since he couldn't take a poo...

6215
03:34:06,400 --> 03:34:10,570
He returned asking "Why'd I go to the bathroom?"

6216
03:34:10,960 --> 03:34:11,760
He's roaming

6217
03:34:15,650 --> 03:34:17,260
Wow

6218
03:34:18,320 --> 03:34:19,880
Roaming about

6219
03:34:19,680 --> 03:34:20,580
Wow

6220
03:34:24,620 --> 03:34:25,190
Old fart

6221
03:34:26,420 --> 03:34:29,160
He went from putting something in his mouth... to releasing something

6222
03:34:28,830 --> 03:34:29,740
Exactly

6223
03:34:30,590 --> 03:34:30,930
Can I build on this?

6224
03:34:30,930 --> 03:34:32,960
Can I build on this?

6225
03:34:33,010 --> 03:34:33,610
The other day, sediment was raining down on Shinjuku...

6226
03:34:33,610 --> 03:34:34,850
The other day, sediment was raining down on Shinjuku..

6227
03:34:34,850 --> 03:34:36,120
The other day, sediment was raining down on Shinjuku..

6228
03:34:36,130 --> 03:34:38,040
My umbrella broken, holding my umbrella

6229
03:34:38,040 --> 03:34:40,500
and I was running vigorously...

6230
03:34:41,660 --> 03:34:43,370
and the umbrella frame is like...

6231
03:34:43,620 --> 03:34:44,780
all by myself

6232
03:34:44,120 --> 03:34:44,780
Hey Muramoto...

6233
03:34:45,010 --> 03:34:46,940
Go home!

6234
03:34:50,360 --> 03:34:52,470
This is about Tanaka

6235
03:34:53,680 --> 03:34:55,990
Have you heard of these shoes that help you run faster?

6236
03:34:55,990 --> 03:34:58,060
For kids...

6237
03:34:56,150 --> 03:35:12,290
Syunsoku Shoes

6238
03:34:56,150 --> 03:35:12,290
Tanaka's Scoop

6239
03:34:59,160 --> 03:35:00,070
He has a son who plays soccer

6240
03:35:00,070 --> 03:35:02,330
He has a son who plays soccer

6241
03:35:02,330 --> 03:35:06,460
He bought these shoes for his son to run faster and told him

6242
03:35:06,460 --> 03:35:08,300
"You can play harder with these!"

6243
03:35:08,300 --> 03:35:10,030
but when Tanaka watched a match,

6244
03:35:10,030 --> 03:35:10,430
his son was the goalkeeper

6245
03:35:10,430 --> 03:35:12,290
his son was the goalkeeper

6246
03:35:17,070 --> 03:35:18,410
He didn't know

6247
03:35:23,510 --> 03:35:26,170
You didn't know?

6248
03:35:27,670 --> 03:35:28,340
That's no good...

6249
03:35:28,570 --> 03:35:29,700
I've got another

6250
03:35:29,150 --> 03:35:30,350
Go ahead, Muramoto

6251
03:35:30,350 --> 03:35:31,090
Let me say this

6252
03:35:31,410 --> 03:35:33,020
This is about "Takakura Moving Center"

6253
03:35:33,420 --> 03:35:42,320
Takakura Moving Center

6254
03:35:33,420 --> 03:35:42,320
Young actor who's helped hundreds of celebs

6255
03:35:33,420 --> 03:35:42,320
m 0 0 l 1245 0 l 1245 168 l 0 168 l 0 0

6256
03:35:33,420 --> 03:35:42,320
move using top rate methods

6257
03:35:34,070 --> 03:35:35,460
This is about "Takakura Moving Center"

6258
03:35:36,110 --> 03:35:37,190
About Takakura Moving Center?

6259
03:35:36,890 --> 03:35:38,330
This is about "Takakura Moving Center"

6260
03:35:38,650 --> 03:35:41,350
I asked for some help moving from Takakura the other day

6261
03:35:42,500 --> 03:35:54,380
Balcony Garden

6262
03:35:42,500 --> 03:35:54,380
Takakura Moving Center Scoop

6263
03:35:42,520 --> 03:35:46,040
I said, "If you're serious, throw in some balcony gardening for free"

6264
03:35:46,300 --> 03:35:49,870
Then the thread was marked "read" so suddenly

6265
03:35:50,070 --> 03:35:51,540
This guy just leapt at me

6266
03:35:52,190 --> 03:35:53,240
Takakura Center...

6267
03:35:53,490 --> 03:35:54,380
Muramoto

6268
03:35:54,660 --> 03:35:56,310
I'm going to kill you

6269
03:35:59,730 --> 03:36:01,920
This is a bit about Matsumoto

6270
03:36:01,920 --> 03:36:04,100
I was mentioning something about muscles

6271
03:36:04,100 --> 03:36:06,010
Then the conversation became about weight training

6272
03:36:06,160 --> 03:36:08,010
So he starts talking about how much he benches

6273
03:36:06,170 --> 03:36:21,590
Matusmoto's Scoop

6274
03:36:06,170 --> 03:36:21,590
Weight Training

6275
03:36:08,040 --> 03:36:11,030
"How many reps? How much weight?" kind of convo

6276
03:36:11,330 --> 03:36:12,960
Then suddenly he's like "that moment..."

6277
03:36:13,160 --> 03:36:14,630
When you hit your limit

6278
03:36:14,850 --> 03:36:16,000
Your huge muscles just become incredibly itchy, right?

6279
03:36:16,000 --> 03:36:17,130
Your huge muscles just become incredibly itchy, right?

6280
03:36:17,180 --> 03:36:19,540
Then I was just like "uh, yeah..."

6281
03:36:19,750 --> 03:36:21,590
I really had no clue what he was talking about

6282
03:36:29,810 --> 03:36:31,330
He was the only one who got that

6283
03:36:34,520 --> 03:36:36,350
I'd like to share one

6284
03:36:36,350 --> 03:36:37,870
This is quite recent

6285
03:36:36,500 --> 03:37:38,220
Matsumoto's Scoop

6286
03:36:36,500 --> 03:37:38,220
Osaka Show

6287
03:36:37,870 --> 03:36:38,560
Matsumoto is doing a show in Osaka

6288
03:36:38,560 --> 03:36:40,620
Matsumoto is doing a show in Osaka

6289
03:36:40,620 --> 03:36:42,230
with Tamukento and Miyasako

6290
03:36:42,760 --> 03:36:43,790
This one time

6291
03:36:43,890 --> 03:36:44,510
It's the end of the work day, and they're eating

6292
03:36:44,510 --> 03:36:46,150
It's the end of the work day, and they're eating

6293
03:36:46,360 --> 03:36:48,570
"What should we do after this?"

6294
03:36:48,570 --> 03:36:49,730
Like go to a bar or something

6295
03:36:49,730 --> 03:36:51,240
or go to a Cigar Bar

6296
03:36:51,400 --> 03:36:53,300
They've got many different choices available

6297
03:36:53,600 --> 03:36:54,720
When you don't stay after what do you (Matsumoto) end up doing?

6298
03:36:54,720 --> 03:36:55,840
When you don't stay after what do you (Matsumoto) end up doing?

6299
03:36:55,840 --> 03:36:58,280
When you don't stay after what do you (Matsumoto) end up doing?

6300
03:36:58,280 --> 03:37:00,390
I want to go to a girl's bar

6301
03:37:00,890 --> 03:37:03,610
It's like, can you really say something like that?

6302
03:37:03,210 --> 03:37:04,500
Yeah... that's rare

6303
03:37:04,680 --> 03:37:06,100
But ultimately a girl's bar was a no-go,

6304
03:37:06,580 --> 03:37:10,300
some girls might say this or that

6305
03:37:10,550 --> 03:37:11,740
Since that was no good...

6306
03:37:12,560 --> 03:37:13,670
Then... what about a cabaret?

6307
03:37:13,670 --> 03:37:15,430
Then... what about a cabaret?

6308
03:37:15,810 --> 03:37:17,810
Cabaret?

6309
03:37:17,290 --> 03:37:17,980
A cabaret!

6310
03:37:18,500 --> 03:37:20,760
What a grand, refined leisure activity for the local area

6311
03:37:20,760 --> 03:37:23,880
A cabaret that employs a bunch of crusty grandmas

6312
03:37:23,930 --> 03:37:25,440
"Yeah, let's go to a cabaret"

6313
03:37:25,620 --> 03:37:26,850
As if he'd actually agree to go to that!

6314
03:37:27,300 --> 03:37:29,170
So the next week when they were together at work

6315
03:37:29,240 --> 03:37:30,820
Miyasako asks Matsumoto

6316
03:37:31,060 --> 03:37:33,490
Did you really want to go to a crusty old lady cabaret?

6317
03:37:33,590 --> 03:37:34,480
WHY!?

6318
03:37:34,680 --> 03:37:38,220
Well... I wanted to just chat

6319
03:37:41,120 --> 03:37:43,100
I really didn't get the point

6320
03:37:43,500 --> 03:37:44,490
Just why!?

6321
03:37:44,890 --> 03:37:47,020
He wants to talk with the old ladies

6322
03:37:46,570 --> 03:37:47,810
Did he have no one to talk to recently?

6323
03:37:48,760 --> 03:37:50,840
He's gotten to be that age

6324
03:37:51,630 --> 03:37:56,150
He wouldn't explain anything else to me

6325
03:37:53,410 --> 03:37:54,110
That's cruel!

6326
03:37:56,150 --> 03:37:59,040
Downtown's Matsumoto's Twitter account has 4 million followers

6327
03:37:59,040 --> 03:38:01,640

6329
03:38:00,750 --> 03:38:02,140
Amazing! Did you know that?

6330
03:38:02,140 --> 03:38:04,590
It's only 2-3 years old, and he's surpassed 4 million

6331
03:38:05,560 --> 03:38:06,290
His daily ramblings become internet news

6332
03:38:06,290 --> 03:38:07,980
His daily ramblings become internet news

6333
03:38:07,980 --> 03:38:10,310
I too like to read his posts, and like them

6334
03:38:10,510 --> 03:38:12,300
He makes very high quality posts, very high quality posts

6335
03:38:12,300 --> 03:38:14,180
He makes very high quality posts, very high quality posts

6336
03:38:14,180 --> 03:38:14,570
Occasionally you get posts that make you wonder "WTF"

6337
03:38:14,570 --> 03:38:15,770
Occasionally you get posts that make you wonder "WTF"

6338
03:38:15,770 --> 03:38:17,970
Occasionally you get posts that make you wonder "WTF"

6339
03:38:17,300 --> 03:38:19,820
Most of his posts will blow you away

6340
03:38:20,070 --> 03:38:21,340
So I wanted to share a few with you

6341
03:38:21,210 --> 03:38:22,110
Please go ahead

6342
03:38:21,960 --> 03:38:23,540
Well

6343
03:38:23,540 --> 03:38:31,640
Comedians are like fairies...

6344
03:38:25,680 --> 03:38:31,640
Wonder if they can't be seen by people who don't laugh.

6345
03:38:29,170 --> 03:38:31,270
What a great Tweet.

6346
03:38:31,350 --> 03:38:32,600
Just as expected, Matsumoto's Twitter is great.

6347
03:38:32,600 --> 03:38:34,250
Just as expected, Matsumoto's Twitter is great.

6348
03:38:34,420 --> 03:38:35,910
Let's take one more step.

6349
03:38:36,140 --> 03:38:37,120
This surprised me.

6350
03:38:37,670 --> 03:38:47,230
Ghosts are scary cause you can see beings that are dead

6351
03:38:41,680 --> 03:38:47,230
If someone says they aren't afraid,

6352
03:38:44,730 --> 03:38:47,230
they must be dead.

6353
03:38:56,490 --> 03:38:58,450
If you say that ghosts are scary...

6354
03:39:01,330 --> 03:39:02,130
Usually

6355
03:39:02,130 --> 03:39:05,240
Matsumoto's Tweets have

6356
03:39:03,630 --> 03:39:04,130
50-60,000 likes but

6357
03:39:04,130 --> 03:39:05,240
50-60,000 likes but

6358
03:39:05,240 --> 03:39:06,750
This has only 2000 likes.

6359
03:39:15,780 --> 03:39:18,380
That's something, Matsumoto.

6360
03:39:19,980 --> 03:39:21,850
9:30 pm

6361
03:39:20,480 --> 03:39:25,220
Research facility  Worked for 13 hours and 30 minutes

6362
03:39:22,420 --> 03:39:23,500
Tired, so very tired.

6363
03:39:23,500 --> 03:39:25,220
Tired, so very tired.

6364
03:39:25,840 --> 03:39:27,570
The fatigue is building up.

6365
03:39:29,310 --> 03:39:31,310
They have no words for each other.

6366
03:39:33,760 --> 03:39:35,920
Just then...

6367
03:39:37,230 --> 03:39:42,090
Alcohol. It affects people differently.

6368
03:39:37,680 --> 03:39:42,610
Alcohol

6369
03:39:40,300 --> 03:39:41,570
It has come.

6370
03:39:42,910 --> 03:39:44,220
If you drink too much, your memory can become hazy

6371
03:39:44,220 --> 03:39:46,260
If you drink too much, your memory can become hazy

6372
03:39:44,220 --> 03:39:49,830
Memory

6373
03:39:46,540 --> 03:39:49,310
and after a few hours, you will become dead drunk.

6374
03:39:46,790 --> 03:39:49,830
Dead drunk

6375
03:39:50,460 --> 03:39:54,890
Here at Gasu Kurobikari science research labs,

6376
03:39:55,570 --> 03:40:00,270
we will study the effects of alcohol on sleep patterns.

6377
03:40:00,420 --> 03:40:04,580
Testing alcohol's effect on sleep patterns

6378
03:40:01,190 --> 03:40:02,240
Start of drinking and its effects on sleep test.

6379
03:40:02,240 --> 03:40:04,190
Start of drinking and its effects on sleep test.

6380
03:40:04,910 --> 03:40:11,080
Average middle aged man as the test rat.

6381
03:40:06,130 --> 03:40:09,330
Let's try the experiment on a middle-aged man.

6382
03:40:09,400 --> 03:40:09,930
This...

6383
03:40:10,430 --> 03:40:11,620
Looks bad.

6384
03:40:11,670 --> 03:40:12,300
Can it be?

6385
03:40:12,090 --> 03:40:12,690
First,

6386
03:40:12,670 --> 03:40:17,670
Intaking alcohol at a small restaurant

6387
03:40:12,770 --> 03:40:16,520
drinking alcohol at a small restaurant.

6388
03:40:17,990 --> 03:40:19,590
The man is

6389
03:40:20,690 --> 03:40:21,530
Please stop.

6390
03:40:21,730 --> 03:40:22,980
Welcome

6391
03:40:22,180 --> 03:40:22,980
Hi, we'come

6392
03:40:23,060 --> 03:40:25,070
He came out.

6393
03:40:23,310 --> 03:40:24,410
Party of one?

6394
03:40:24,410 --> 03:40:25,030
Yes

6395
03:40:25,820 --> 03:40:27,580
Yes, please.

6396
03:40:27,580 --> 03:40:37,790
Onishi Hideaki   52 years old

6397
03:40:28,220 --> 03:40:29,520
Mister Onishi Hideaki

6398
03:40:29,670 --> 03:40:30,850
52 years old

6399
03:40:31,340 --> 03:40:34,170
In the case of this man drinking,

6400
03:40:32,890 --> 03:40:34,270
Can Jimmy hold his liquor?

6401
03:40:34,320 --> 03:40:37,090
what will happen to his sleep pattern?

6402
03:40:34,640 --> 03:40:36,690
I wonder.

6403
03:40:37,740 --> 03:40:39,230
He isn't strong at all.

6404
03:40:39,500 --> 03:40:40,460
Ah! You're Jimmy Onishi, aren't you?

6405
03:40:40,460 --> 03:40:42,500
Ah! You're Jimmy Onishi, aren't you?

6406
03:40:42,220 --> 03:40:42,900
Yes, I am

6407
03:40:42,500 --> 03:40:44,480
Welcome, welcome!

6408
03:40:44,850 --> 03:40:46,090
Sorry. Thank-

6409
03:40:46,500 --> 03:40:47,870
What will you drink?

6410
03:40:48,640 --> 03:40:49,410
Um...

6411
03:40:49,410 --> 03:40:49,970
First, for starters,

6412
03:40:49,970 --> 03:40:53,010
First, for starters,

6413
03:40:53,010 --> 03:40:55,550
draft beer.

6414
03:40:57,460 --> 03:40:59,370
If I am already laughing just at this.

6415
03:40:59,780 --> 03:41:00,480
There wasn't even anything particularly funny about it.

6416
03:41:00,480 --> 03:41:03,190
There wasn't even anything particularly funny about it.

6417
03:41:03,190 --> 03:41:04,100
Right now he is to blame.

6418
03:41:04,100 --> 03:41:05,460
Right now he is to blame.

6419
03:41:05,440 --> 03:41:06,140
Wait...

6420
03:41:06,360 --> 03:41:07,120
Do your best.

6421
03:41:06,360 --> 03:41:07,120
That's right.

6422
03:41:07,070 --> 03:41:08,360
This...

6423
03:41:07,420 --> 03:41:08,340
Indeed.

6424
03:41:08,340 --> 03:41:09,190
He is the bad person.

6425
03:41:09,310 --> 03:41:10,440
This is pure bullying.

6426
03:41:10,440 --> 03:41:13,510
This is pure bullying.

6427
03:41:11,930 --> 03:41:13,360
That's how Jimmy always does it.

6428
03:41:13,660 --> 03:41:14,510
Um...

6429
03:41:14,510 --> 03:41:15,170
First, for starters,

6430
03:41:15,170 --> 03:41:18,170
First, for starters,

6431
03:41:18,170 --> 03:41:19,340
draft beer.

6432
03:41:19,520 --> 03:41:20,550
I will pour it for you.

6433
03:41:20,000 --> 03:41:20,700
Thanks.

6434
03:41:20,700 --> 03:41:24,120
This earnest version of Jimmy might be hard.

6435
03:41:23,620 --> 03:41:26,180
What if I took you out, cutie sis?

6436
03:41:26,160 --> 03:41:27,340
You are good at holding it.

6437
03:41:27,040 --> 03:41:27,790
Aren't I?

6438
03:41:29,230 --> 03:41:29,610
Looks delicious. It is delicious.

6439
03:41:29,610 --> 03:41:31,880
Looks delicious. It is delicious.

6440
03:41:30,460 --> 03:41:31,570
Huh?

6441
03:41:31,900 --> 03:41:33,280
Did you work today?

6442
03:41:33,280 --> 03:41:35,050
Huh?

6443
03:41:33,630 --> 03:41:34,840
Any work today?

6444
03:41:35,070 --> 03:41:39,260
Today was traveling for work.

6445
03:41:36,170 --> 03:41:36,750
Travel?

6446
03:41:37,450 --> 03:41:38,770
That sounds so hard.

6447
03:41:39,790 --> 03:41:40,870
Jimmy Onishi,

6448
03:41:40,870 --> 03:41:43,290
what do you do on your days off?

6449
03:41:43,290 --> 03:41:46,230
Huh?

6450
03:41:43,690 --> 03:41:45,030
What do you do on your days off?

6451
03:41:55,040 --> 03:41:56,560
Why is he asking her to repeat herself?

6452
03:41:56,160 --> 03:41:56,770
Right.

6453
03:41:56,660 --> 03:41:57,620
That's enough.

6454
03:42:00,290 --> 03:42:00,990
Let's do our best.

6455
03:42:00,990 --> 03:42:02,450
This is really not good.

6456
03:42:02,480 --> 03:42:05,550
Why ask her to repeat herself?

6457
03:42:03,560 --> 03:42:05,550
That guy is so irritating, seriously

6458
03:42:04,510 --> 03:42:05,550
Indeed.

6459
03:42:05,720 --> 03:42:10,850
Continuing with the hostess' drink.

6460
03:42:05,720 --> 03:42:10,850
Inside of the shop for 30 minutes.

6461
03:42:06,020 --> 03:42:07,580
With the beautiful hostess' beer,

6462
03:42:07,730 --> 03:42:09,940
Onishi continues.

6463
03:42:10,950 --> 03:42:12,360
In my case,

6464
03:42:12,360 --> 03:42:15,230
I can really hold my liquor.

6465
03:42:13,570 --> 03:42:15,190
No matter how much you drink?

6466
03:42:15,410 --> 03:42:15,790
I am really not that weak.

6467
03:42:15,790 --> 03:42:18,400
I am really not that weak.

6468
03:42:17,090 --> 03:42:18,600
Is that so?

6469
03:42:18,480 --> 03:42:19,860
Because my dad did it.

6470
03:42:27,600 --> 03:42:28,960
I understand.

6471
03:42:28,710 --> 03:42:30,120
What's up with him?

6472
03:42:33,740 --> 03:42:36,810
It will happen slowly...

6473
03:42:37,160 --> 03:42:45,120
Enjoying himself with the hostess

6474
03:42:37,160 --> 03:42:45,120
Inside of the shop for 1 hour

6475
03:42:37,980 --> 03:42:39,980
Conversation with the hostess is flowing

6476
03:42:40,180 --> 03:42:43,700
Onishi's beer glass is also raised.

6477
03:42:45,260 --> 03:42:45,820
As expected

6478
03:42:45,820 --> 03:42:47,120
Mr. Onishi has so many talents.

6479
03:42:47,120 --> 03:42:49,490
Mr. Onishi has so many talents.

6480
03:42:49,490 --> 03:42:51,240
You must be quite popular, right?

6481
03:42:51,810 --> 03:42:54,210
Yes, I am popular-a-plenty.

6482
03:42:53,710 --> 03:42:55,100
Just as I thought.

6483
03:42:55,450 --> 03:42:56,980
For example, what happens?

6484
03:42:56,980 --> 03:42:58,400
Like those lips of yours should never be given to anyone else.

6485
03:42:58,400 --> 03:42:58,940
Like those lips of yours should never be given to anyone else.

6486
03:42:58,940 --> 03:43:00,550
Like those lips of yours should never be given to anyone else.

6487
03:43:00,550 --> 03:43:02,610
Like those lips of yours should never be given to anyone else.

6488
03:43:02,810 --> 03:43:03,620
I can't stand it with these sweet lips of mine.

6489
03:43:03,620 --> 03:43:06,790
I can't stand it with these sweet lips of mine.

6490
03:43:05,890 --> 03:43:06,640
Is that the case?

6491
03:43:06,790 --> 03:43:08,480
They're world-renowned.

6492
03:43:08,650 --> 03:43:09,780
World-renowned?

6493
03:43:09,430 --> 03:43:09,910
Yes.

6494
03:43:09,910 --> 03:43:11,820
Various countries' women?

6495
03:43:11,820 --> 03:43:13,120
Various countries' women?

6496
03:43:12,600 --> 03:43:13,130
That's why

6497
03:43:13,130 --> 03:43:14,130
Brasileiro.

6498
03:43:14,180 --> 03:43:15,420
Brasileiro.

6499
03:43:15,440 --> 03:43:16,120
Brazilian.

6500
03:43:16,170 --> 03:43:19,290
Brasileiro.

6501
03:43:19,640 --> 03:43:24,040
Brazilian  Brasileiro.

6502
03:43:24,290 --> 03:43:25,880
Brazilian is fine.

6503
03:43:26,230 --> 03:43:27,660
Geez.

6504
03:43:26,860 --> 03:43:27,710
Don't give up.

6505
03:43:35,290 --> 03:43:37,320
It's fine if he misspeaks.

6506
03:43:37,320 --> 03:43:38,940
The message has been received.

6507
03:43:37,970 --> 03:43:38,780
Right.

6508
03:43:38,960 --> 03:43:39,810
It's fine, you don't have to say it, no matter what.

6509
03:43:39,810 --> 03:43:41,710
It's fine, you don't have to say it, no matter what.

6510
03:43:42,080 --> 03:43:42,750
Brazilian.

6511
03:43:42,800 --> 03:43:45,020
Brasileiro.

6512
03:43:45,450 --> 03:43:46,630
Brasileiro.

6513
03:43:46,670 --> 03:43:48,120
Brazil...

6514
03:43:48,170 --> 03:43:49,550
Brasileiro.

6515
03:43:50,850 --> 03:43:51,790
If customers came and sat here...

6516
03:43:51,790 --> 03:43:54,370
If customers came and sat here...

6517
03:43:54,370 --> 03:43:56,630
I can clean up.

6518
03:43:56,560 --> 03:43:57,540
You will clean up?

6519
03:43:57,540 --> 03:44:01,310
Notice

6520
03:43:59,230 --> 03:44:01,160
But isn't it...

6521
03:44:01,600 --> 03:44:03,280
But isn't it...

6522
03:44:09,890 --> 03:44:10,520
So quick.

6523
03:44:10,970 --> 03:44:11,460
Terrible.

6524
03:44:11,460 --> 03:44:12,790
I can't believe this.

6525
03:44:14,090 --> 03:44:15,760
It's here.

6526
03:44:18,850 --> 03:44:19,420
Terrible.

6527
03:44:19,470 --> 03:44:22,170
Mr. Jimmy's...

6528
03:44:22,240 --> 03:44:22,940
What should we do?

6529
03:44:23,550 --> 03:44:25,090
Yeah, what should we do?

6530
03:44:25,590 --> 03:44:26,670
You will clean up?

6531
03:44:26,720 --> 03:44:30,490
Notice

6532
03:44:28,590 --> 03:44:30,140
But isn't it...

6533
03:44:30,790 --> 03:44:32,430
But isn't it...

6534
03:44:35,420 --> 03:44:36,350
Mr. Onishi?

6535
03:44:37,080 --> 03:44:38,420
Mr. Onishi, are you okay?

6536
03:44:39,840 --> 03:44:48,350
Inside of the shop for 2 hours and 12 minutes.

6537
03:44:39,840 --> 03:44:48,350
Mr. Onishi fell asleep.

6538
03:44:40,550 --> 03:44:43,270
Having visited the shop for nearly 2 hours,

6539
03:44:43,820 --> 03:44:47,090
Mr. Onishi fell asleep.

6540
03:44:48,930 --> 03:44:50,560
Thank you for coming.

6541
03:44:50,610 --> 03:44:52,250
Please do come again.

Truly great.

6553
03:45:07,060 --> 03:45:11,870
Dead drunk Mr. Onishi

6554
03:45:07,610 --> 03:45:10,330
Completely dead drunk Mr. Onishi.

6555
03:45:11,180 --> 03:45:11,990
Coming next...

6556
03:45:12,240 --> 03:45:19,680
Shocking sleep pattern experiment unveiling

6557
03:45:12,820 --> 03:45:15,190
We will unveil the shocking sleep pattern experiment.

6558
03:45:15,690 --> 03:45:17,970
This year's Jimmy is unparalleled.

6559
03:45:20,640 --> 03:45:22,350
Thank you for coming

His manager moves him by carrying him on his back.

6571
03:45:28,080 --> 03:45:30,250
In an emergency his manager rushes in

6572
03:45:30,250 --> 03:45:33,870
and moves the dead drunk Mr. Onishi.

6573
03:45:35,880 --> 03:45:39,400
Having no idea that he is partaking in a sleep experiment.

6574
03:45:37,590 --> 03:45:41,800
Arrival time

6575
03:45:39,730 --> 03:45:41,410
Taken to the testing grounds.

6576
03:45:42,250 --> 03:45:47,600
Manager helps him change before sleep

6577
03:45:42,550 --> 03:45:44,080
With the helping hands of his manager

6578
03:45:44,080 --> 03:45:46,720
changes into pyjamas and is being put to bed.

6579
03:45:50,720 --> 03:45:51,710
Slap

6580
03:45:53,740 --> 03:45:55,310
Finally

6581
03:45:55,630 --> 03:45:59,070
they succeed in putting Onishi to sleep.

6582
03:46:01,970 --> 03:46:03,600
Suzuki (Manager)

6583
03:46:03,650 --> 03:46:04,500
Hic

6584
03:46:04,550 --> 03:46:06,420
Suzuki~

6585
03:46:07,470 --> 03:46:09,760
I said Suzuki!!

6586
03:46:11,510 --> 03:46:12,830
Su'ki~

6587
03:46:12,880 --> 03:46:14,510
Hic!

6588
03:46:16,670 --> 03:46:17,530
What?

6589
03:46:17,530 --> 03:46:20,000
Prepare a banana for me...

6590
03:46:18,600 --> 03:46:19,420
What is it?

6591
03:46:20,020 --> 03:46:21,940
Banana

6592
03:46:27,240 --> 03:46:29,680
It's his manager or what?

6593
03:46:29,400 --> 03:46:30,860
It really is something.

6594
03:46:33,980 --> 03:46:36,090
That's how he is?

6595
03:46:34,580 --> 03:46:36,200
He is like that?

6596
03:46:36,900 --> 03:46:38,340
He is a real veteran.

6597
03:46:38,370 --> 03:46:38,990
Slap, that's how she hit him.

6598
03:46:38,990 --> 03:46:40,820
Slap, that's how she hit him.

6599
03:46:39,760 --> 03:46:40,820
She really did slap him.

6600
03:46:40,820 --> 03:46:42,930
In spite of being a veteran...

6601
03:46:42,930 --> 03:46:43,430
Higher up than us, he is the senpai.

6602
03:46:43,430 --> 03:46:46,060
Higher up than us, he is the senpai.

6603
03:46:44,440 --> 03:46:46,060
Right you are.

6604
03:46:46,080 --> 03:46:46,730
That manager's pretty young, isn't she?

6605
03:46:46,730 --> 03:46:48,110
That manager's pretty young, isn't she?

6606
03:46:48,160 --> 03:46:49,330
What?

6607
03:46:49,370 --> 03:46:49,900
Hic

6608
03:46:49,900 --> 03:46:50,830
Very well, sir.

6609
03:46:49,900 --> 03:46:51,740
Banana

6610
03:46:51,750 --> 03:46:53,450
Prepare a banana for me already!

6611
03:46:53,490 --> 03:46:55,210
I will get you a banana.

6612
03:47:00,590 --> 03:47:06,750
Waiting for Mr. Onishi to fall into deep sleep.

6613
03:47:00,990 --> 03:47:01,710
First,

6614
03:47:02,080 --> 03:47:04,510
let's wait until Mr. Onishi

6615
03:47:04,710 --> 03:47:06,720
falls into deep sleep.

6616
03:47:09,920 --> 03:47:14,170
Bao

6617
03:47:10,290 --> 03:47:14,170
Grrrrrrrrrrrr

6618
03:47:15,930 --> 03:47:20,160
Bao

6619
03:47:20,610 --> 03:47:25,300
Bao

6620
03:47:31,470 --> 03:47:33,540
He truly is a dog.

6621
03:47:36,860 --> 03:47:40,150
Does that kind of sound ever come out?

6622
03:47:37,260 --> 03:47:39,350
I have never made that sound.

6623
03:47:38,900 --> 03:47:40,150
First time seeing this.

6624
03:47:39,670 --> 03:47:41,080
Never ever!

6625
03:47:41,530 --> 03:47:45,890
Bao

6626
03:47:41,970 --> 03:47:45,890
Grrrrrrrrrrrr

6627
03:47:47,570 --> 03:47:51,830
Bao

6628
03:47:55,380 --> 03:47:56,980
Bao

6629
03:47:57,730 --> 03:48:01,350
Grrrrrrrrrrrr

6630
03:48:05,960 --> 03:48:08,680
This is impossible to endure.

6631
03:48:12,970 --> 03:48:14,180
This is terrible.

6632
03:48:14,180 --> 03:48:17,200
This really is something.

6633
03:48:16,020 --> 03:48:17,200
What's up with it?

6634
03:48:17,250 --> 03:48:19,160
Why does he sound like that?

6635
03:48:20,420 --> 03:48:22,830
Bao

6636
03:48:25,950 --> 03:48:28,480
Grrrrrr

6637
03:48:30,200 --> 03:48:30,680
Arf

6638
03:48:32,700 --> 03:48:34,800
Grrrrrr

6639
03:48:34,850 --> 03:48:36,290
The first sleep study

6640
03:48:38,120 --> 03:48:41,240
Do they really need to write it out? That's sinister!

6641
03:48:41,240 --> 03:48:43,280
No kidding

6642
03:48:44,010 --> 03:48:46,400
"Grrrrrrr" and what not

6643
03:48:48,920 --> 03:48:50,800
This is unbelievable!

6644
03:48:51,250 --> 03:48:52,340
Unbelievable

6645
03:48:53,110 --> 03:48:56,330
They're bringing it to us

6646
03:48:56,330 --> 03:48:58,190
Bringing me to tears

6647
03:48:58,040 --> 03:48:59,800
Let's get through this

6648
03:48:59,880 --> 03:49:02,900
Just about to move on to the next segment too

6649
03:49:03,520 --> 03:49:04,580
1:30 in the morning

6650
03:49:04,630 --> 03:49:06,120
Let's move up to there

6651
03:49:06,520 --> 03:49:07,900
From here again!?

6652
03:49:12,580 --> 03:49:14,990
Grrrrrr

6653
03:49:16,850 --> 03:49:18,630
Arf

6654
03:49:19,120 --> 03:49:21,180
Grrrrrr

6655
03:49:21,380 --> 03:49:25,190
The first sleep study

6656
03:49:26,290 --> 03:49:33,760
Miyagawa Daisuke

6657
03:49:26,290 --> 03:49:33,760
Researcher

6658
03:49:27,070 --> 03:49:32,060
The experiment will be conducted by our elite researcher Miyagawa Daisuke

6659
03:49:34,410 --> 03:49:43,360
Drunk Sleep Study Responsiveness Test 1

6660
03:49:34,410 --> 03:49:43,360
How will he respond to electric shock?

6661
03:49:34,660 --> 03:49:38,840
First we'll equip him with these shocking pads

6662
03:49:38,840 --> 03:49:42,040
Then we'll observe what kind of response he'll give

6663
03:49:42,610 --> 03:49:44,770
So suddenly?

6664
03:49:53,980 --> 03:49:55,640
On the cheek?

6665
03:50:08,160 --> 03:50:10,370
Switched ON

6666
03:50:18,790 --> 03:50:21,930
Drunk Sleep Study Responsiveness Test 2

6667
03:50:18,790 --> 03:50:21,930
Increasing shock strength

6668
03:50:19,230 --> 03:50:21,340
Let's try increasing the power

6669
03:50:37,130 --> 03:50:37,990
This is bad

6670
03:50:39,680 --> 03:50:41,210
I won't make it

6671
03:50:41,780 --> 03:50:47,450
Subject was not woken with only 1 shock

6672
03:50:42,250 --> 03:50:46,970
Owing to the subject's intoxication, we found he was unable to be woken

6673
03:50:46,970 --> 03:50:47,800
I see

6674
03:50:48,100 --> 03:50:53,240
Drunk Sleep Study Responsiveness Test 3

6675
03:50:48,100 --> 03:50:53,240
What will triple the number of shock pads do?

6676
03:50:48,200 --> 03:50:51,420
Let's see how he reacts to an increased number of shock pads

6677
03:50:51,070 --> 03:50:52,210
Are you serious?

6678
03:50:54,140 --> 03:51:00,270
Face, Arms and Legs are the three positions we'll test; let's begin

6679
03:51:01,280 --> 03:51:03,640
Switch ON

6680
03:51:28,780 --> 03:51:31,410
This is so cruel! Cruel!

6681
03:51:36,670 --> 03:51:38,200
Cruel! Cruel! Cruel!

6682
03:51:38,670 --> 03:51:40,170
Why does he fall off?

6683
03:51:46,330 --> 03:51:47,660
He's an animal

6684
03:51:52,070 --> 03:51:53,020
Freaky

6685
03:52:21,980 --> 03:52:24,430
Wait, wait, stop

6686
03:52:25,400 --> 03:52:28,000
He's an animal!

6687
03:52:28,000 --> 03:52:32,580
I really can't make it through this

6688
03:52:29,510 --> 03:52:31,820
He's an amazing person

6689
03:52:44,250 --> 03:52:46,140
He's like a bear

6690
03:52:54,860 --> 03:52:56,550
He's a monster

6691
03:53:01,000 --> 03:53:03,560
He's really a monster

6692
03:53:23,160 --> 03:53:25,510
Hurry up and be over

6693
03:53:25,510 --> 03:53:27,460
Ow~~, my butt can't handle this

6694
03:53:29,620 --> 03:53:31,080
My butt won't make it

6695
03:53:38,370 --> 03:53:43,950
Still half-asleep, Onishi appears completely unaware of the researchers around him

6696
03:53:45,850 --> 03:53:49,950
Test Results: Subject does not awaken via electric shock

6697
03:53:48,850 --> 03:53:54,520
Drunk Sleep Study
Response Test Complete

6698
03:53:57,230 --> 03:53:59,600
Wow

6699
03:53:57,330 --> 03:53:58,760
I'm glad that's over

6700
03:53:59,880 --> 03:54:01,710
Those were Jimmy's true instincts

6701
03:54:01,710 --> 03:54:02,750
Those were Jimmy's true instincts

6702
03:54:03,970 --> 03:54:05,350
That was crazy

6703
03:54:07,550 --> 03:54:17,180
14 hours, 30 minutes since beginning work

6704
03:54:07,550 --> 03:54:17,180
The faces of 5 people who had the life sucked out of them

6705
03:54:07,800 --> 03:54:12,190
With the force of a megaton bomb, Jimmy Onishi sucked the life out of 5

6706
03:54:13,890 --> 03:54:16,310
BUT, after this...

6707
03:54:17,310 --> 03:54:24,600
HE will bring them further hell!!

6708
03:54:17,860 --> 03:54:20,370
His appearance marks their darkest moment

6709
03:54:20,370 --> 03:54:22,970
His appearance marks their darkest moment

6710
03:54:25,820 --> 03:54:31,090
10:30pm: The appearance of Jimmy has exhausted our researchers

6711
03:54:26,590 --> 03:54:31,090
14 hours, 30 minutes into working at a research institute

6712
03:54:31,540 --> 03:54:33,950
just as news of a big event arrives

6713
03:54:41,650 --> 03:54:42,640
You're kidding me

6714
03:54:43,090 --> 03:54:53,600
A state of emergency has been declared!!

6715
03:54:43,090 --> 03:54:53,600
Internal Announcement

6716
03:54:44,720 --> 03:54:53,600
Extremely dangerous chemicals have been detected!

6717
03:54:47,440 --> 03:54:53,600
All researchers, please report to the auditorium!

6718
03:54:53,600 --> 03:54:55,030
Everyone! It's an emergency!

6719
03:54:55,720 --> 03:54:57,950
Change into this and go

6720
03:54:58,200 --> 03:55:09,850
Change into lab coats and head to the auditorium!!

6721
03:54:58,200 --> 03:55:09,850
Extremely dangerous chemicals found in the institute

6722
03:54:58,450 --> 03:55:02,160
Extremely dangerous chemicals have been found in the institute;

6723
03:55:02,530 --> 03:55:06,500
the five will change into coats and head to the auditorium

6724
03:55:06,700 --> 03:55:07,960
Alright, let's go everyone

6725
03:55:10,470 --> 03:55:14,850
Auditorium

6726
03:55:13,790 --> 03:55:15,250
Please sit in the seats in front

6727
03:55:18,570 --> 03:55:22,880
All research staff have assembled

6728
03:55:28,870 --> 03:55:29,620
They're here

6729
03:55:30,170 --> 03:55:37,280
Research staff explain the situation

6730
03:55:31,900 --> 03:55:37,280
We had no choice but to convene everyone here

6731
03:55:38,040 --> 03:55:42,650
We might bring about the end of humanity here in this institute

6732
03:55:42,650 --> 03:55:46,820
We discovered a terribly dreadful chemical compound

6733
03:55:47,490 --> 03:55:52,190
We'll hear more about this matter from the lead inventor

6734
03:55:52,260 --> 03:55:54,040
Without further ado...

6735
03:56:01,530 --> 03:56:03,690
God damn

6736
03:56:04,400 --> 03:56:06,660
Chono Masahiro Barges In!!

6737
03:56:04,400 --> 03:56:06,660
Lead Research Inventor

6738
03:56:08,890 --> 03:56:12,610
I'm the Head of the Inventing Department, Chono

6739
03:56:13,080 --> 03:56:15,600
I'm fucking pissed

6740
03:56:15,780 --> 03:56:18,280
Who did it!?

6741
03:56:18,800 --> 03:56:20,900
It's one of you

6742
03:56:21,200 --> 03:56:27,330
Discovery of catastrophic chemical release!

6743
03:56:21,200 --> 03:56:27,330
The culprit is among the scientists!!

6744
03:56:22,860 --> 03:56:26,010
I will have to expose the culprit

6745
03:56:27,790 --> 03:56:33,250
The culprit is in the auditorium!

6746
03:56:27,940 --> 03:56:33,250
Manhunt for the catastrophic inventor!!

6747
03:56:33,400 --> 03:56:36,490
He has to be here

6748
03:56:42,590 --> 03:56:44,290
It's you

6749
03:56:45,390 --> 03:56:47,560
No way

6750
03:56:47,560 --> 03:56:52,350
Unexpectedly quiet voice

6751
03:56:52,840 --> 03:56:54,500
Why so quiet?

6752
03:57:07,530 --> 03:57:09,670
IT'S YOU

6753
03:57:14,620 --> 03:57:16,230
My fucking ear

6754
03:57:27,850 --> 03:57:29,490
How pitiful

6755
03:57:29,490 --> 03:57:34,130
There is no one with the integrity to talk

6756
03:57:34,130 --> 03:57:37,130
This chemical compound

6757
03:57:37,710 --> 03:57:42,080
is luminescent under the right light

6758
03:57:42,200 --> 03:57:48,820
Catastrophic Chemical

6759
03:57:42,200 --> 03:57:48,820
Luminescence under a special light

6760
03:57:45,500 --> 03:57:48,520
The culprit who engaged in this research will absolutely...

6761
03:57:49,630 --> 03:57:51,390
have this liquid somewhere on their body

6762
03:57:51,390 --> 03:57:52,710
have this liquid somewhere on their body

6763
03:57:52,710 --> 03:57:55,160
have this liquid somewhere on their body

6764
03:57:55,310 --> 03:58:03,110
Catastrophically Dangerous Chemical Invention

6765
03:57:55,310 --> 03:58:03,110
The culprit has liquid on them that will light up!!

6766
03:57:56,720 --> 03:58:02,050
Even the smallest amount of this liquid will shine brightly

6767
03:58:03,860 --> 03:58:06,310
Kill the lights

6768
03:58:06,340 --> 03:58:12,010
Shining the special light in:

6769
03:58:07,090 --> 03:58:08,340
Let's do this!

6770
03:58:16,640 --> 03:58:23,860
Hosei's face shines bright

6771
03:58:20,520 --> 03:58:22,310
That's gross

6772
03:58:22,790 --> 03:58:24,340
Wait, what the hell?

6773
03:58:27,210 --> 03:58:29,130
It was that bad!?

6774
03:58:28,010 --> 03:58:29,670
What is that!?

6775
03:58:29,900 --> 03:58:31,780
This stuff exists!?

6776
03:58:30,550 --> 03:58:34,450
Hosei has no idea what's going on

6777
03:58:37,140 --> 03:58:39,460
It's you!!

6778
03:58:38,070 --> 03:58:39,580
WHEN!?

6779
03:58:39,460 --> 03:58:42,630
Did you wash your face in it or what!?

6780
03:58:43,160 --> 03:58:45,260
That stuff Kamikawa poured on you

6781
03:58:45,210 --> 03:58:46,470
Showered him...

6782
03:58:46,200 --> 03:58:47,780
Really doused him

6783
03:58:48,130 --> 03:58:55,760
Catastrophically Dangerous Chemical Invention

6784
03:58:48,130 --> 03:58:55,760
The culprit is new researcher, Tsukitei Hosei

6785
03:58:50,040 --> 03:58:54,120
Seriously, your entire face was lighting up

6786
03:58:54,770 --> 03:58:56,130
Why!?

6787
03:58:55,960 --> 03:58:57,130
It was illuminated!

6788
03:58:57,130 --> 03:58:58,890
ME!?

6789
03:58:58,040 --> 03:58:58,960
Yeah!

6790
03:58:59,210 --> 03:59:01,810
WHY!?

6791
03:59:00,830 --> 03:59:02,010
That's what I want to know

6792
03:59:02,330 --> 03:59:04,300
I really have absolutely no clue what's going on

6793
03:59:02,330 --> 03:59:07,440
Hosei can't come to terms with the situation

6794
03:59:04,730 --> 03:59:07,350
If you're looking for luminescence...

6795
03:59:08,000 --> 03:59:10,710
That guy's head lit up a little bit

6796
03:59:11,020 --> 03:59:12,690
This guy definitely lit up

6797
03:59:12,980 --> 03:59:16,330
GIVE HIM THE BLACK LIGHT

6798
03:59:14,740 --> 03:59:15,490
LOOK AT HIM

6799
03:59:15,490 --> 03:59:17,060
You bastard

6800
03:59:16,330 --> 03:59:18,060
Where?

6801
03:59:18,060 --> 03:59:19,920
The head

6802
03:59:20,370 --> 03:59:21,980
Your FACE lit up

6803
03:59:21,980 --> 03:59:23,570
My face!?

6804
03:59:31,030 --> 03:59:32,580
My face?

6805
03:59:31,690 --> 03:59:32,580
My Face?

6806
03:59:33,860 --> 03:59:37,470
You couldn't see yourself

6807
03:59:35,800 --> 03:59:37,070
So scummy

6808
03:59:37,570 --> 03:59:38,730
"Scummy"? I didn't do anything!

6809
03:59:38,730 --> 03:59:42,790
"Scummy"? I didn't do anything!

6810
03:59:40,670 --> 03:59:42,670
Your face lit up

6811
03:59:42,790 --> 03:59:44,970
What do you mean "My face lit up"?

6812
03:59:44,970 --> 03:59:48,840
There's more proof, get up here!!

6813
03:59:49,130 --> 03:59:54,630
More evidence presented on stage!!

6814
03:59:54,980 --> 03:59:57,090
Bring that example out

6815
04:00:05,390 --> 04:00:08,660
This is something we confiscated

6816
04:00:15,250 --> 04:00:17,240
It is called Kamikawa fluid...

6817
04:00:17,760 --> 04:00:22,330
Evidence

6818
04:00:17,760 --> 04:00:22,330
Kamikawa fluid

6819
04:00:20,910 --> 04:00:21,540
Do you remember?

6820
04:00:22,500 --> 04:00:23,930
Haa~ I get it now...

6821
04:00:23,930 --> 04:00:26,270
I understand.

6822
04:00:25,110 --> 04:00:25,950
Explain it then.

6823
04:00:26,270 --> 04:00:30,670
It's just Kamikawa fluid.

6824
04:00:31,200 --> 04:00:32,200
The reason...

6825
04:00:34,840 --> 04:00:36,710
This is straight out of a cheap drama

6826
04:00:41,280 --> 04:00:43,100
Honestly, what is this?

6827
04:00:42,720 --> 04:00:43,350
Chono, please.

6828
04:00:43,100 --> 04:00:43,820
Terrible acting

6829
04:00:43,820 --> 04:00:44,930
Please, I can explain it, really.

6830
04:00:44,930 --> 04:00:45,320
Yeah?

6831
04:00:45,320 --> 04:00:47,890
I was given a quiz.

6832
04:00:48,150 --> 04:00:50,290
But I answered incorrectly.

6833
04:00:50,290 --> 04:00:53,810
Then, a balloon exploded and covered me in Kamikawa's fluid

6834
04:00:53,810 --> 04:00:55,580
Then, a balloon exploded and covered me in Kamikawa's fluid

6835
04:00:55,660 --> 04:00:58,030
That's it, the fluid was the punishment!

6836
04:00:58,350 --> 04:01:00,350
Right, tell the truth this time.

6837
04:00:59,670 --> 04:01:00,650
I just did!

6838
04:01:00,700 --> 04:01:02,370
Just ask them!!

6839
04:01:01,920 --> 04:01:02,370
Who?

6840
04:01:02,370 --> 04:01:03,770
Those four guys will tell you!

6841
04:01:03,920 --> 04:01:04,800
Hey, Tanaka. You saw it! I got drenched!

6842
04:01:04,800 --> 04:01:05,570
Hey, Tanaka. You saw it! I got drenched!

6843
04:01:05,570 --> 04:01:08,070
Hey, Tanaka. You saw it! I got drenched!

6844
04:01:07,090 --> 04:01:08,070
Say it

6845
04:01:11,410 --> 04:01:12,130
He didn't see it...

6846
04:01:12,130 --> 04:01:12,950
But Endo! You saw it right?! Endo!!

6847
04:01:12,950 --> 04:01:15,610
But Endo! You saw it right?! Endo!!

6848
04:01:15,610 --> 04:01:17,000
It didn't happen, did it?!

6849
04:01:17,000 --> 04:01:19,170
Hamada, please tell him!

6850
04:01:19,490 --> 04:01:21,250
Wait, no! You too, Matsumoto?

6851
04:01:20,550 --> 04:01:21,700
It seems they don't know anything.

6852
04:01:21,250 --> 04:01:23,190
Wait, no! You too, Matsumoto?

6853
04:01:23,190 --> 04:01:25,120
Didn't see it...

6854
04:01:25,360 --> 04:01:27,560
What's wrong with you guys, honestly?

6855
04:01:28,790 --> 04:01:30,060
How long are you gonna stall?

6856
04:01:32,060 --> 04:01:33,070
But that guy, he's the one that lit up.

6857
04:01:33,070 --> 04:01:34,570
But that guy, he's the one that lit up.

6858
04:01:34,570 --> 04:01:41,010
For some reason, Matsumoto is targeted.

6859
04:01:34,730 --> 04:01:35,580
What lit up?

6860
04:01:36,750 --> 04:01:38,290
He's really desperate.

6861
04:01:41,890 --> 04:01:44,410
Why me?

6862
04:01:43,530 --> 04:01:45,230
Best not to say anything

6863
04:01:46,430 --> 04:01:47,680
He's a scientist too?

6864
04:01:47,880 --> 04:01:48,910
Yes, sir!

6865
04:01:48,910 --> 04:01:50,550
He didn't get any fluid on him though?

6866
04:01:50,550 --> 04:01:52,790
His head lit up though!

6867
04:01:52,790 --> 04:01:53,990
No sir, it didn't.

6868
04:01:54,020 --> 04:01:55,640
TELL US THE TRUTH!

6869
04:01:56,260 --> 04:01:58,020
Did it really?

6870
04:01:58,620 --> 04:02:00,260
It did! You guys didn't notice!!

6871
04:02:00,260 --> 04:02:01,930
Just accept it.

6872
04:02:02,260 --> 04:02:03,680
I swear I didn't glow!

6873
04:02:03,830 --> 04:02:05,700
JUST ADMIT IT!!

6874
04:02:05,970 --> 04:02:11,020
Why are you yelling though?

6875
04:02:14,640 --> 04:02:15,560
He's right.

6876
04:02:18,960 --> 04:02:21,460
Really, getting slapped for this?

6877
04:02:20,950 --> 04:02:22,450
He's really got some vendetta against me today.

6878
04:02:22,450 --> 04:02:24,100
He's really got some vendetta against me today.

6879
04:02:24,950 --> 04:02:28,390
You leave me no choice but to punish you.

6880
04:02:28,390 --> 04:02:31,720
Laughing in my face?

6881
04:02:30,810 --> 04:02:31,710
Stop messing around.

6882
04:02:31,940 --> 04:02:32,440
Huh?

6883
04:02:32,510 --> 04:02:33,910
Right? You get me?

6884
04:02:34,830 --> 04:02:37,100
It must have been you!

6885
04:02:37,480 --> 04:02:39,300
Just admit what you did...

6886
04:02:39,750 --> 04:02:41,730
Please, just, slap him as well.

6887
04:02:42,430 --> 04:02:47,840
Still trying to drag Matsumoto down.

6888
04:02:44,590 --> 04:02:47,110
You're actually messed up.

6889
04:02:47,190 --> 04:02:48,620
What is this?

6890
04:02:49,260 --> 04:02:50,510
I'm begging you!

6891
04:02:50,830 --> 04:02:52,110
"Slap us both, please"

6892
04:02:51,410 --> 04:02:51,980
Just slap us byoth-both at the same time!

6893
04:02:51,980 --> 04:02:54,080
Just slap me- slap us at the same time!

6894
04:02:55,970 --> 04:02:57,470
You really are just a coward.

6895
04:02:57,470 --> 04:02:58,580
You really are.

6896
04:02:58,280 --> 04:03:00,090
Answer this, then.

6897
04:03:00,090 --> 04:03:02,440
Why did you develop that chemical?

6898
04:03:03,190 --> 04:03:05,520
I answered a quiz.

6899
04:03:05,520 --> 04:03:08,290
But alas, my answer was incorrect.

6900
04:03:08,290 --> 04:03:09,930
At that time, some fluid fell down.

6901
04:03:09,930 --> 04:03:11,180
At that time, some fluid fell down.

6902
04:03:11,180 --> 04:03:12,360
At that time, some fluid fell down.

6903
04:03:12,360 --> 04:03:13,800
At that time, some fluid fell down.

6904
04:03:13,800 --> 04:03:16,170
At that time, some fluid fell down.

6905
04:03:21,620 --> 04:03:24,290
Stop messing around!

6906
04:03:28,960 --> 04:03:29,680
Oy, Tsukitei!

6907
04:03:31,520 --> 04:03:34,190
Did you not see how you glowed?!

6908
04:03:34,850 --> 04:03:36,440
I dunno~

6909
04:03:36,440 --> 04:03:37,940
Anyone have a mirror?

6910
04:03:38,660 --> 04:03:40,280
Go sit down again.

6911
04:03:41,060 --> 04:03:44,900
A mirror will reveal his true face!

6912
04:03:41,060 --> 04:03:44,900
A mirror will reveal his true face!

6913
04:03:42,830 --> 04:03:44,710
This guy's really...

6914
04:03:52,660 --> 04:03:53,270
We good?

6915
04:03:56,980 --> 04:03:57,690
All right. Final check.

6916
04:04:00,080 --> 04:04:03,000
Turn off the lights!

6917
04:04:03,050 --> 04:04:03,750
Black light ON!

6918
04:04:03,750 --> 04:04:04,680
Black light ON!

6919
04:04:11,160 --> 04:04:14,030
What the hell?!

6920
04:04:20,230 --> 04:04:20,770
Right?

6921
04:04:20,770 --> 04:04:21,800
Why did this happen?

6922
04:04:22,600 --> 04:04:23,340
Why?!

6923
04:04:23,940 --> 04:04:25,350
Shines like a lighthouse.

6924
04:04:27,810 --> 04:04:29,210
ah... seriously...

6925
04:04:29,260 --> 04:04:30,810
The glow was amazing

6926
04:04:30,560 --> 04:04:31,580
Even so,

6927
04:04:31,840 --> 04:04:34,880
my glow can't be compared to his, right?

6928
04:04:34,880 --> 04:04:37,550
It's on a different level entirely.

6929
04:04:36,230 --> 04:04:37,280
Completely different.

6930
04:04:37,780 --> 04:04:38,850
Alright Hosei, come up here.

6931
04:04:38,850 --> 04:04:39,690
Alright, come here.

6932
04:04:40,020 --> 04:04:44,440
Hosei's excuse falls through!

6933
04:04:47,210 --> 04:04:48,210
He laughed a bit there.

6934
04:04:49,460 --> 04:04:51,530
You gonna confess?

6935
04:04:54,350 --> 04:04:56,570
I'm pretty disappointed.

6936
04:04:56,170 --> 04:04:56,850
I'm sorry.

6937
04:04:57,720 --> 04:04:58,700
I accept my dues.

6938
04:04:58,700 --> 04:04:59,940
This year's pretty amazing, eh?

6939
04:04:59,940 --> 04:05:00,990
This year's pretty amazing, eh?

6940
04:05:01,590 --> 04:05:02,240
Amazing.

6941
04:05:02,240 --> 04:05:02,690
Yes.

6942
04:05:03,930 --> 04:05:08,760
Our suspect receives the slap of judgement!

6943
04:05:03,930 --> 04:05:08,760
Our suspect receives the slap of judgement!

6944
04:05:04,010 --> 04:05:04,960
W-wait, Chono.

6945
04:05:06,230 --> 04:05:07,650
Please say when you go for it. Wait a second please...

6946
04:05:09,330 --> 04:05:10,300
Sorry, sorry.

6947
04:05:11,120 --> 04:05:11,780
Make sure you ask for forgiveness in your heart, as well.

6948
04:05:11,780 --> 04:05:13,870
Make sure you ask for forgiveness in your heart, as well.

6949
04:05:13,870 --> 04:05:15,290
Make sure you ask for forgiveness in your heart, as well.

6950
04:05:15,750 --> 04:05:16,540
I'm sorry for creating that fluid!

6951
04:05:16,540 --> 04:05:17,260
I'm sorry for creating that fluid!

6952
04:05:17,260 --> 04:05:18,240
I'm sorry for creating that fluid!

6953
04:05:18,590 --> 04:05:20,060
So it was you, after all!

6954
04:05:20,060 --> 04:05:22,630
Wait what?! NO!

6955
04:05:48,090 --> 04:05:48,690
I'm sorry, again.

6956
04:05:50,440 --> 04:05:52,320
Don't make me get serious.

6957
04:05:51,660 --> 04:05:52,340
Yes, sir.

6958
04:05:54,790 --> 04:05:57,030
Can I take off my glasses first?

6959
04:05:55,810 --> 04:05:56,450
Do it.

6960
04:06:02,840 --> 04:06:03,440
Ready?!

6961
04:06:03,420 --> 04:06:04,940
He's doing it.

6962
04:06:05,300 --> 04:06:07,390
I'm gonna use my full strength.

6963
04:06:08,310 --> 04:06:09,110
Let's go!!

6964
04:06:15,560 --> 04:06:21,590
The slap of judgement -

6965
04:06:15,560 --> 04:06:21,590
The slap of judgement -

6966
04:06:16,050 --> 04:06:21,590
deliv

6967
04:06:16,230 --> 04:06:21,590
ered!

6968
04:06:24,040 --> 04:06:26,230
GOD

6969
04:06:24,690 --> 04:06:26,230
DAMN!!

6970
04:06:42,160 --> 04:06:44,660
Yamazaki still had a grudge there, right?

6971
04:06:44,790 --> 04:06:47,200
How he went after Matsumoto.

6972
04:06:44,810 --> 04:06:47,330
Kinda disgusting.

6973
04:06:47,330 --> 04:06:51,050
But, it's fine right, Matsumoto?

6974
04:06:49,310 --> 04:06:49,870
What?

6975
04:06:51,970 --> 04:06:53,590
I was honestly just joking.

6976
04:06:57,140 --> 04:06:58,260
Honestly, I don't feel bad for you.

6977
04:06:58,260 --> 04:06:59,710
Honestly, I don't feel bad for you.

6978
04:06:59,960 --> 04:07:02,980
You should've gotten slapped twice.

6979
04:07:04,230 --> 04:07:05,960
11:30 PM

6980
04:07:04,930 --> 04:07:09,420
15 hours and 30 minutes into their laboratory work.

6981
04:07:06,470 --> 04:07:08,670
Still a lot of work to be done.

6982
04:07:12,390 --> 04:07:13,560
How you guys doin'?

6983
04:07:14,640 --> 04:07:16,380
Our elite scientists are under attack by workers who want higher wages

6984
04:07:16,380 --> 04:07:18,010
Our elite scientists are under attack by workers who want higher wages

6985
04:07:18,010 --> 04:07:20,030
Our elite scientists are under attack by workers who want higher wages

6986
04:07:20,030 --> 04:07:21,580
Our elite scientists are under attack by workers who want higher wages

6987
04:07:21,900 --> 04:07:23,200
They can't be reasoned with, so let's go hear them out together!!

6988
04:07:23,200 --> 04:07:25,320
They can't be reasoned with, so let's go hear them out together!!

6989
04:07:25,770 --> 04:07:27,470
Well in that case, absolutely!

6990
04:07:27,470 --> 04:07:28,070
Well in that case, absolutely!

6991
04:07:27,800 --> 04:07:28,490
Let's go.

6992
04:07:28,220 --> 04:07:33,960
Our five heroes head out to intervene!!

6993
04:07:28,220 --> 04:07:33,960
Simple workers are attacking the labs!

6994
04:07:32,140 --> 04:07:33,380
You're really honest

6995
04:07:34,460 --> 04:07:42,670
Better go there as fast as possible!!

6996
04:07:34,460 --> 04:07:42,670
If there is trouble at this time then...

6997
04:07:34,810 --> 04:07:39,110
If there is trouble at this time, then it's roughly predictable what is going to happen

6998
04:07:39,130 --> 04:07:42,130
Our five scientists rush to the nearby research facility to assist!

6999
04:07:43,390 --> 04:07:47,490
What awaits them there is...

7000
04:07:47,590 --> 04:07:48,420
This way please~

7001
04:07:47,740 --> 04:07:53,230
Another wing of the laboratory

7002
04:07:49,810 --> 04:07:53,230
This is just gonna be those guys again?

7003
04:07:51,060 --> 04:07:52,490
I think so. I hear voices.

7004
04:07:56,160 --> 04:07:58,200
Just sit down over there.

7005
04:07:59,870 --> 04:08:03,640
We can't work with this tiny budget!!

7006
04:08:03,640 --> 04:08:06,860
Says the guys who are always behind schedule!!

7007
04:08:06,860 --> 04:08:12,600
An explosive mood straight from the start.

7008
04:08:08,480 --> 04:08:10,500
We can't even buy a single screw!

7009
04:08:10,930 --> 04:08:12,530
Stop grumbling, just shut up already!

7010
04:08:12,830 --> 04:08:13,630
So, uh, guys

7011
04:08:13,970 --> 04:08:14,970
I will be back so meanwhile, so can you  watch over them?

7012
04:08:14,970 --> 04:08:18,170
I will be back so meanwhile, so can you watch over them?

7013
04:08:16,320 --> 04:08:18,170
Aren't we supposed to convince these guys?

7014
04:08:18,440 --> 04:08:20,940
Doesn't seem like they're gonna stop any time soon.

7015
04:08:20,940 --> 04:08:22,940
What are you gonna do?

7016
04:08:22,940 --> 04:08:24,710
Bring it on!

7017
04:08:24,710 --> 04:08:26,380
Our famous warcry might convince you

7018
04:08:26,380 --> 04:08:27,450
Our famous warcry might convince you

7019
04:08:27,450 --> 04:08:29,820
A failure to negotiate

7020
04:08:30,720 --> 04:08:34,740
At last - popular and famous comedians battle each other in their fundoshi underwear!

7021
04:08:30,950 --> 04:08:37,960
With an average age of 45, these comedians will show you!

7022
04:08:31,420 --> 04:08:37,960
The start of the festival where they put their bodies and pride on the line!

7023
04:08:34,740 --> 04:08:37,270
Now begins their greatest battle festival yet!

7024
04:08:37,960 --> 04:08:40,430
First, we battle one on one!

7025
04:08:37,960 --> 04:08:40,430
Kendo Kobayashi

7026
04:08:37,960 --> 04:08:40,430
Ueshima's lieutenant

7027
04:08:42,380 --> 04:08:45,600
First: Sensual Breath Challenge!!

7028
04:08:47,870 --> 04:08:50,690
While your opponent tries to excite you with their breath,

7029
04:08:48,200 --> 04:08:57,610
Don't react in any way, or you'll lose the duel!

7030
04:08:48,200 --> 04:08:57,610
For 30 seconds, endure your opponent's breath!

7031
04:08:48,200 --> 04:08:57,610
Sensual Breath Challenge

7032
04:08:48,200 --> 04:08:57,610
m 0 0 l 1489.5 0 l 1489.5 181.5 l 0 181.5 l 0 0

7033
04:08:48,200 --> 04:08:57,610
m 0 0 l 1489.5 0 l 1489.5 181.5 l 0 181.5 l 0 0

7034
04:08:50,890 --> 04:08:53,540
you must endure, without reacting or making a noise!

7035
04:08:53,560 --> 04:08:55,470
You guys are too sensitive for this!

7036
04:08:56,480 --> 04:08:57,410
From my side...

7037
04:08:57,960 --> 04:09:02,800
Our most resilient, eroti- elite soldier, IWAO!!

7038
04:09:02,710 --> 04:09:04,070
Hell yeah!

7039
04:09:02,780 --> 04:09:06,990
Iwao Nozomu

7040
04:09:02,780 --> 04:09:06,990
Ueshima's army

7041
04:09:05,550 --> 04:09:07,450
Why's he always up for this?

7042
04:09:06,450 --> 04:09:07,600
I don't get it either.

7043
04:09:07,820 --> 04:09:09,450
If you're putting up Iwao, then Tanaka will take him on!

7044
04:09:09,450 --> 04:09:11,790
If you're putting up Iwao, then Tanaka will take him on!

7045
04:09:11,360 --> 04:09:13,960
Get in there! Show 'em up!

7046
04:09:11,790 --> 04:09:15,430
Degawa army

7047
04:09:11,790 --> 04:09:15,430
Tanaka Takushi

7048
04:09:14,010 --> 04:09:15,290
Make it sensual!

7049
04:09:14,490 --> 04:09:15,780
Year after year!

7050
04:09:15,780 --> 04:09:16,360
Whenever it's Iwao  will- uh- you always send Tanaka out!

7051
04:09:16,360 --> 04:09:16,630
Whenever it's Iwao will-  uh- you always send Tanaka out!

7052
04:09:16,630 --> 04:09:17,180
Whenever it's Iwao will-  uh- you always send Tanaka out!

7053
04:09:17,180 --> 04:09:20,000
Whenever it's Iwao will-  uh- you always send Tanaka out!

7054
04:09:18,800 --> 04:09:20,450
Huh?

7055
04:09:21,070 --> 04:09:21,400
He's screwing up his lines a lot...

7056
04:09:21,400 --> 04:09:24,640
He's screwing up his lines a lot...

7057
04:09:21,980 --> 04:09:22,880
Yeah.

7058
04:09:22,990 --> 04:09:24,450
Guess he's tired?

7059
04:09:25,620 --> 04:09:26,460
Also what's he doing?

7060
04:09:27,090 --> 04:09:28,370
What the hell are you up to, Degawa?

7061
04:09:27,410 --> 04:09:32,950
Adjusting his underwear during the match

7062
04:09:30,530 --> 04:09:31,330
Hurry up.

7063
04:09:31,030 --> 04:09:32,930
How embarrassing.

7064
04:09:34,050 --> 04:09:35,630
Let's go, ready!

7065
04:09:36,110 --> 04:09:36,820
Start!

7066
04:09:44,810 --> 04:09:45,460
He moaned!

7067
04:09:45,760 --> 04:09:46,290
Again!

7068
04:09:46,290 --> 04:09:46,780
And again!

7069
04:09:46,760 --> 04:09:48,080
No he didn't!

7070
04:09:47,460 --> 04:09:48,530
He's not even trying.

7071
04:09:49,080 --> 04:09:49,860
He let out a moan!

7072
04:09:50,230 --> 04:09:51,000
Do your best, Tanaka!

7073
04:09:52,700 --> 04:09:55,270
He's just casually letting it (his voice) out

7074
04:09:55,270 --> 04:09:57,270
No, he's not

7075
04:10:00,990 --> 04:10:01,990
Over and over again!

7076
04:10:02,260 --> 04:10:03,660
Is touching allowed here?

7077
04:10:04,290 --> 04:10:05,840
That kind of interest exists,

7078
04:10:05,790 --> 04:10:06,650
right?

7079
04:10:10,400 --> 04:10:12,130
Okay, stop!

7080
04:10:11,280 --> 04:10:12,400
Was touching allowed?

7081
04:10:13,120 --> 04:10:15,590
I thought you had to use your breath...

7082
04:10:18,210 --> 04:10:19,110
Now, switch offense and defense

7083
04:10:18,520 --> 04:10:20,760
Switch

7084
04:10:19,110 --> 04:10:20,630
Now, switch offense and defense

7085
04:10:20,760 --> 04:10:22,880
Non-chan is amazing

7086
04:10:22,860 --> 04:10:24,200
Non-chan is amazing

7087
04:10:23,310 --> 04:10:25,200
We're going to check if Iwao makes a sound!!

7088
04:10:25,200 --> 04:10:26,470
You can do it!

7089
04:10:25,660 --> 04:10:27,270
Take it easy, Iwao!

7090
04:10:27,270 --> 04:10:28,330
Iwao's face...

7091
04:10:28,330 --> 04:10:29,580
This might not work

7092
04:10:28,500 --> 04:10:30,570
Wow, that face... he can't

7093
04:10:33,010 --> 04:10:34,090
This is bad

7094
04:10:39,340 --> 04:10:40,650
Iwao...

7095
04:10:42,850 --> 04:10:43,850
This guy is a different race!!

7096
04:10:43,850 --> 04:10:46,390
This guy is a different race!!

7097
04:10:45,470 --> 04:10:46,950
What's with that face!?

7098
04:10:48,270 --> 04:10:50,460
This is so disgusting

7099
04:10:50,710 --> 04:10:52,360
Nice work, Tanaka!

7100
04:10:53,410 --> 04:10:55,280
Just like that!

7101
04:10:54,960 --> 04:10:56,680
Oh... no, he's out

7102
04:10:55,740 --> 04:10:57,330
He made a sound!!

7103
04:11:00,070 --> 04:11:01,430
Nice, Tanaka!

7104
04:11:02,170 --> 04:11:03,850
He made a sound!

7105
04:11:02,950 --> 04:11:04,470
What the hell?

7106
04:11:04,950 --> 04:11:06,470
What the hell?

7107
04:11:05,940 --> 04:11:07,990
What the hell is this?

7108
04:11:12,110 --> 04:11:14,400
Nice, Tanaka!

7109
04:11:14,400 --> 04:11:16,210
Good job!!

7110
04:11:16,100 --> 04:11:17,330
Just like that!

7111
04:11:17,500 --> 04:11:18,480
Continuing with this amount of force, we'll kill you!

7112
04:11:18,480 --> 04:11:20,170
Continuing with this amount of force, we'll kill you!

7113
04:11:19,420 --> 04:11:20,940
YEAH!!

7114
04:11:20,390 --> 04:11:22,450
Bring out THAT THING!!

7115
04:11:22,950 --> 04:11:25,160
What is that!?

7116
04:11:24,870 --> 04:11:26,210
Oh, it's here

7117
04:11:26,210 --> 04:11:26,930
What's this?

7118
04:11:27,010 --> 04:11:29,430
Guys like you probably

7119
04:11:29,430 --> 04:11:31,430

7120
04:11:31,600 --> 04:11:33,550

7126
04:11:38,840 --> 04:11:40,410
and eats the somen in one go, without using his hands

7127
04:11:40,410 --> 04:11:43,680
and eats the somen in one go, without using his hands

7128
04:11:41,510 --> 04:11:43,210
Whatever!

7129
04:11:43,780 --> 04:11:45,940
That's impossible!

7130
04:11:44,180 --> 04:11:46,280
Show us!

7131
04:11:44,510 --> 04:11:46,330
What does he mean?

7132
04:11:46,310 --> 04:11:49,260
Is that even possible!?

7133
04:11:46,660 --> 04:11:54,720
catch noodles in it, and eat the noodles from there

7134
04:11:46,660 --> 04:11:54,720
Fill up a tank with noodle broth and wear it on his head,

7135
04:11:46,660 --> 04:11:54,720
Team Uehara's Pride

7136

I'd like to see you try!

7141
04:11:54,670 --> 04:11:55,990
There's a lot to eat!

7142
04:11:55,490 --> 04:12:00,360
Waiting after putting bowl on

7143
04:11:55,990 --> 04:11:57,190
Cheer him on guys!

7144
04:11:57,110 --> 04:11:59,020
I see...

7145
04:11:58,560 --> 04:11:59,710
Okay

7146
04:11:59,710 --> 04:12:00,480
Now,

7147
04:12:00,480 --> 04:12:01,730
Cue noodle broth!

7148
04:12:00,610 --> 04:12:04,530
After filling with broth, START

7149
04:12:01,730 --> 04:12:02,690
Get the noodles

7150
04:12:02,240 --> 04:12:03,550
I'll bring the flowing noodles

7151
04:12:03,550 --> 04:12:04,530
It's in

7152
04:12:04,730 --> 04:12:06,400
Here we go!!

7153
04:12:05,830 --> 04:12:07,020
The broth!!

7154
04:12:08,000 --> 04:12:08,520
You good?

7155
04:12:09,270 --> 04:12:13,710
Noodles will flow after broth

7156
04:12:10,250 --> 04:12:11,450
Here we go, Komiya

7157
04:12:10,850 --> 04:12:11,650
Get ready!!

7158
04:12:11,620 --> 04:12:12,250
Go! Go!

7159
04:12:12,590 --> 04:12:13,210
It's coming!!

7160
04:12:13,210 --> 04:12:16,510
The noodles, the noodles!

7161
04:12:16,510 --> 04:12:17,790
There they go!!

7162
04:12:16,780 --> 04:12:19,380
Noodles

7163
04:12:17,360 --> 04:12:20,030
The noodles!

7164
04:12:21,150 --> 04:12:22,800
The noodles are flowing!

7165
04:12:22,800 --> 04:12:24,920
THE NOODLES!

7166
04:12:28,120 --> 04:12:31,040
What the heck!?

7167
04:12:29,100 --> 04:12:30,740
What the hell?

7168
04:12:30,040 --> 04:12:31,770
That was-

7169
04:12:32,210 --> 04:12:33,760
You didn't do anything!!

7170
04:12:33,760 --> 04:12:36,010
You just opened your eyes!

7171
04:12:36,010 --> 04:12:38,230
What are you gonna do with that!?

7172
04:12:38,000 --> 04:12:40,400
The noodles were slower than I thought!!

7173
04:12:40,930 --> 04:12:42,850
You're useless!

7174
04:12:43,520 --> 04:12:46,370
Somen is a smooth noodle!

7175
04:12:46,590 --> 04:12:48,860
I can do it with Chinese noodles!

7176
04:12:50,990 --> 04:12:53,450
I'll show you!

04:12:52,130 --> 04:12:57,300
Team Degawa's Pride

7178
04:12:52,130 --> 04:12:57,300

Try it then!

7180
04:12:56,260 --> 04:12:58,930
You said you'd do it with Chinese noodles!

7181
04:12:58,500 --> 04:13:00,590
Just now, what was...

7182
04:13:00,720 --> 04:13:04,440
Hey, what are you doing talking normally!?

7183
04:13:04,210 --> 04:13:05,690
What are you doing!?

7184
04:13:04,440 --> 04:13:07,030
Why are you talking like normal?!

7185
04:13:05,690 --> 04:13:08,290
That was-

7186
04:13:09,900 --> 04:13:11,550
The flowing noodles

7187
04:13:11,100 --> 04:13:11,960
Like that

7188
04:13:11,960 --> 04:13:13,220
The water

7189
04:13:13,830 --> 04:13:15,030
Scary!

We will!

7194
04:13:19,700 --> 04:13:21,640
What the..?

7195
04:13:20,290 --> 04:13:22,040
What's with the arrangement?

7196
04:13:22,870 --> 04:13:23,280
Here it comes, Hosshan!!

7197
04:13:23,280 --> 04:13:24,360
Here it comes, Hosshan!!

7198
04:13:24,260 --> 04:13:25,390
Wait, stop it... stop it halfway, okay?

7199
04:13:24,660 --> 04:13:28,350
After filling the broth, START

7200
04:13:25,390 --> 04:13:26,650
Wait, stop it... stop it halfway, okay?

7201
04:13:26,290 --> 04:13:27,680
You already said that!

7202
04:13:27,350 --> 04:13:28,610
Not yet though!

7203
04:13:28,010 --> 04:13:29,330
In front of his mouth

7204
04:13:29,330 --> 04:13:30,400
Not yet, oh, not yet

7205
04:13:30,330 --> 04:13:31,420
Now?

7206
04:13:30,400 --> 04:13:31,430
Not yet, oh, not yet

7207
04:13:31,880 --> 04:13:32,820
Come on!

7208
04:13:32,020 --> 04:13:37,440
After stopping in front of his mouth, he will eat it in one go

7209
04:13:32,820 --> 04:13:34,340
Come on now!

7210
04:13:32,970 --> 04:13:35,650
After that, I'm gonna go all in!

7211
04:13:35,650 --> 04:13:36,740
Okay, NOW!

7212
04:13:36,290 --> 04:13:37,610
Can you even do it!?

7213
04:13:36,840 --> 04:13:37,660
I'm gonna go!

7214
04:13:38,670 --> 04:13:40,110
Looking good!

7215
04:13:39,770 --> 04:13:40,680
Go go go!

7216
04:13:41,610 --> 04:13:42,580
Come on!

7217
04:13:42,990 --> 04:13:44,050
Here come the noodles!

7218
04:13:43,830 --> 04:13:44,450
Chinese Noodles

7219
04:13:45,180 --> 04:13:46,970
Go go go!!

7220
04:13:46,900 --> 04:13:47,930
Come on!

7221
04:13:47,930 --> 04:13:49,150
The noodles!!

7222
04:13:48,830 --> 04:13:50,290
Eat the noodles!

7223
04:13:49,780 --> 04:13:50,770
Okay, now!!

7224
04:13:54,610 --> 04:13:57,910
HEY!!

7225
04:13:58,360 --> 04:14:00,250
SO close!!

7226
04:14:00,530 --> 04:14:01,550
What the hell was that, Kuro-chan!?

7227
04:14:01,550 --> 04:14:02,600
What the hell was that, Kuro-chan!?

7228
04:14:02,500 --> 04:14:04,120
No, no

7229
04:14:04,220 --> 04:14:05,480
I put it in, but since they're Chinese noodles they don't slide!

7230
04:14:05,480 --> 04:14:08,470
I put it in, but since they're Chinese noodles they don't slide!

7231
04:14:08,920 --> 04:14:10,890
This is quite the battle

7232
04:14:10,410 --> 04:14:14,030
This means we win!!

7233
04:14:16,530 --> 04:14:18,730
It ends here; bring out THAT THING!!

You guys are really bringing this out

04:14:25,170 --> 04:14:29,260
It's the Penis Wheel!!

There it is!

7240
04:14:29,360 --> 04:14:32,680
The member will do a handstand,

7241
04:14:30,210 --> 04:14:38,350
Approaching the Crotch

7242
04:14:30,210 --> 04:14:38,350
The three arms rotate The Devil's Machine

7243
04:14:32,680 --> 04:14:35,030
and the machine will rotate while approaching him

7244
04:14:35,030 --> 04:14:36,650
The Devil's machine!!

7245
04:14:36,650 --> 04:14:38,300
The one who will face this challenge...

7246
04:14:38,600 --> 04:14:42,440
The boy with the penis of steel:  ME!!

7247
04:14:40,390 --> 04:14:40,790
The boy with the penis of steel: ME!!

7248
04:14:40,790 --> 04:14:42,440
The boy with the penis of steel: ME!!

7249
04:14:42,440 --> 04:14:45,460
You're really gonna go up there?!

7250
04:14:44,110 --> 04:14:45,810
Aren't you scared!?

7251
04:14:45,810 --> 04:14:47,860
You're scared!

7252
04:14:47,860 --> 04:14:49,630
Show us what you got!

7253
04:14:48,180 --> 04:14:54,870
Stand against it, no matter how tired your penis is!

Display affection to snakes

7386
04:18:17,920 --> 04:18:29,010
Since it's especially cold this season, they have to put sweaters

7387
04:18:18,350 --> 04:18:21,070
Next up, these snakes are on the stage.

7388
04:18:21,070 --> 04:18:24,460
The teams have to put

7389
04:18:24,460 --> 04:18:26,930
turtleneck sweaters on the cold snakes

7390
04:18:26,930 --> 04:18:29,000
They need to be gentle with the bodies

7391
04:18:29,010 --> 04:18:31,020

04:18:35,190 --> 04:18:36,690
Are these Loo Choo snakes?

7397
04:18:36,400 --> 04:18:38,110
They're kind of chubby

7398
04:18:38,990 --> 04:18:40,410
They're old

7399
04:18:39,270 --> 04:18:40,980
Have you seen one before?

7400
04:18:39,720 --> 04:18:44,230

7401
04:18:40,070 --> 04:18:41,510

That strength, the strength!

7408
04:18:50,290 --> 04:18:52,470
Go, Yoshinobu!!

7409
04:18:53,070 --> 04:18:54,670
Can you reach them?

Looking good!

7411
04:18:55,760 --> 04:18:57,110
Put it on them!!

7412
04:18:56,710 --> 04:18:57,280

Oh that's scary!!

7417
04:19:05,400 --> 04:19:07,390
Put it on them!!

7418
04:19:07,390 --> 04:19:09,070
Like that!

7419
04:19:09,200 --> 04:19:11,090
AaaaaHHHHHH!!

7420
04:19:19,200 --> 04:19:20,670
Did you hear him scream?

7421
04:19:20,250 --> 04:19:21,750
What kind of face!?

7422
04:19:21,750 --> 04:19:23,070
One more!

7423
04:19:22,530 --> 04:19:24,270

So arrogant!

7427
04:19:26,690 --> 04:19:27,670
Okay

7430
04:19:30,310 --> 04:19:33,140
He declared it

7431
04:19:31,880 --> 04:19:33,580
He declared it

7432
04:19:35,330 --> 04:19:37,570
Like earlier: catch, then put through

7433
04:19:37,570 --> 04:19:39,020
Catch, and then...

7434
04:19:39,450 --> 04:19:41,090

7453
04:20:17,590 --> 04:20:19,220
He got the sweater up to the shoulders at least

7454
04:20:19,220 --> 04:20:22,230
He got the sweater up to the shoulders at least

7455
04:20:22,910 --> 04:20:25,900
Next up is the Extremely Hot Chestnut Roaster Machine

7456
04:20:23,030 --> 04:20:26,230
EXTREMELY HOT CHESTNUT ROASTER MACHINE

7457
04:20:26,730 --> 04:20:35,610
Freshly roasted chestnut picked up and eaten with bare hands

04:20:26,730 --> 04:20:35,610
Ueshima Team’s pride

7459
04:20:26,730 --> 04:20:35,610
with only 1 minute to eat them all

7460
04:20:27,200 --> 04:20:30,450
Whilst the chestnuts are steaming hot,

7461
04:20:30,130 --> 04:20:35,610
HARANISHI TAKAYUKI

7462
04:20:30,130 --> 04:20:35,610
UESHIMA TEAM

7463
04:20:31,040 --> 04:20:35,640
Haranishi from Ueshima’s team has to pick them up with his bare hands and peel the skin until all is eaten.

7464
04:20:38,630 --> 04:20:39,280
Let's go!

7465
04:20:39,280 --> 04:20:40,160
Okay, let's do this!

7466
04:20:40,510 --> 04:20:42,280
You can eat as many as you want!

7467
04:20:42,760 --> 04:20:43,250
Start!

7468
04:20:46,220 --> 04:20:47,720

7471
04:20:54,630 --> 04:20:56,360
Peel the skin and eat

7472
04:20:56,360 --> 04:20:57,500
Hot!!

7473
04:21:07,810 --> 04:21:10,240
Ahh!!

7474
04:21:08,540 --> 04:21:10,240
Ouch!!

7475
04:21:14,180 --> 04:21:15,850

7476
04:21:17,600 --> 04:21:19,020

HOT!!

7479
04:21:28,240 --> 04:21:30,500
Ah his face looks painful

7480
04:21:29,490 --> 04:21:31,180
Degawa, you didn’t even eat any

7481
04:21:31,180 --> 04:21:33,160
He did eat them!

7482
04:21:34,230 --> 04:21:35,350
He ate 'em

7483
04:21:35,170 --> 04:21:36,280
Hosshan, he didn’t have any at all!

7484
04:21:36,070 --> 04:21:38,120
I did eat them all!!

7485
04:21:39,420 --> 04:21:39,440
You guys! We’re gonna show you the climax

7486
04:21:39,440 --> 04:21:41,710
You guys! We’re gonna show you the climax

7487
04:21:42,570 --> 04:21:44,180
Bring it out!!

7488
04:21:44,410 --> 04:21:44,910
There it is!!

7489
04:21:44,910 --> 04:21:45,480
There it is!!

7490
04:21:45,480 --> 04:21:46,140
There it is!!

7491
04:21:48,980 --> 04:21:52,000
And finally, the arm wrestling as per usual!!

7492
04:21:52,000 --> 04:21:52,850
On the other hand, this ain’t no easy arm wrestling, yo

7493
04:21:52,850 --> 04:21:55,790
On the other hand, this ain’t no easy arm wrestling, yo

7494
04:21:54,590 --> 04:21:55,790
What are the rules?

7495
04:21:55,790 --> 04:21:59,040
Both opponents have to fill their assholes with

7496
04:21:57,390 --> 04:21:59,040
heaps of air to arm wrestle and...

7497
04:21:59,510 --> 04:21:59,860
The first to fart loses!!

7498
04:21:59,860 --> 04:22:03,530
The first to fart loses!!

7499
04:22:07,000 --> 04:22:10,450
Seriously, man, stop it

7500
04:22:16,310 --> 04:22:19,340
Every year we hear those words...

7501
04:22:19,340 --> 04:22:22,450
Ahh it’s that time of the year again…

7502
04:22:21,680 --> 04:22:22,450

7503
04:22:23,300 --> 04:22:25,300

ANOTHER LEGEND DEGAWA TETSUROU

7507
04:22:41,200 --> 04:22:43,230
As per usual, are you gonna chuck a shit and run home?

7508
04:22:43,230 --> 04:22:45,620
As per usual, are you gonna chuck a shit and run home?

7509
04:22:45,620 --> 04:22:47,840
Let’s do this: whoever chucks a shit first loses

7510
04:22:47,840 --> 04:22:48,710
You’re an idiot!

7511
04:22:48,710 --> 04:22:49,440
Who the hell made up this kind of rule!?

7512
04:22:49,440 --> 04:22:51,180
Who the hell made up this kind of rule!?

7513
04:22:53,640 --> 04:22:56,280
He just suggested that rule

7514
04:22:56,450 --> 04:23:02,890
FARTING-PROHIBITED ARM WRESTLING LEGEND BATTLE

7515
04:22:56,460 --> 04:23:02,890

04:22:58,520 --> 04:23:00,450
Your ass is full of boils and shit…

04:23:00,450 --> 04:23:02,740
Shut the fuck up! Don’t talk about my boils!

7519
04:23:02,920 --> 04:23:05,340
Do not talk about my boils and shit!! Asshole!!

7520
04:23:06,270 --> 04:23:07,680
Don’t fuck around, asshole

7521
04:23:08,630 --> 04:23:09,560
I'll make an airway, hold on

7522
04:23:09,560 --> 04:23:12,930
I'll make an airway, hold on

7523
04:23:16,320 --> 04:23:22,290
The two simultaneously receive air

7524
04:23:24,560 --> 04:23:27,450
Hurry up!!

7525
04:23:25,180 --> 04:23:27,450
Wait!!

7526
04:23:27,450 --> 04:23:30,480
With our leader, we’re in very deep over here!!

7527
04:23:31,420 --> 04:23:33,080
Can we go deeper in please?

7528
04:23:35,070 --> 04:23:36,990
We’re gonna pump air in now!!

7529
04:23:35,970 --> 04:23:39,060
Okay, ready go!

7530
04:23:37,050 --> 04:23:39,060
Ready, go!

7531
04:23:39,170 --> 04:23:41,660
Aaahhh!!

7532
04:23:42,360 --> 04:23:44,230
It (the air) keeps leaking out

7533
04:23:44,900 --> 04:23:49,730
Degawa has air leaking out

7534
04:23:50,770 --> 04:23:52,490
Is my asshole loosening?

7535
04:23:52,370 --> 04:23:54,410
It (the air) keeps coming out

7536
04:23:54,690 --> 04:23:55,590
What’s going on back there? Oh my asshole

7537
04:23:55,590 --> 04:23:57,660
What’s going on back there? Oh my asshole

7538
04:23:58,180 --> 04:23:59,940
Keeps coming out

7539
04:24:00,280 --> 04:24:01,480
Keeps coming out

7540
04:24:02,450 --> 04:24:04,400
What the hell are you saying, man?

7541
04:24:06,150 --> 04:24:08,820
It keeps coming out!!

7542
04:24:12,060 --> 04:24:13,510
What exactly are you saying?

7543
04:24:13,510 --> 04:24:16,130
What’s going on back there?

7544
04:24:16,180 --> 04:24:18,180
Hold up, here we go! Here we go!

7545
04:24:18,180 --> 04:24:19,230
Let’s do it like this, shall we?

7546
04:24:19,360 --> 04:24:24,540
Insert air whilst holding hands

7547
04:24:24,370 --> 04:24:26,220
Here we go!

7548
04:24:25,090 --> 04:24:26,220
Here we go!

7549
04:24:27,220 --> 04:24:29,220
Ah no can’t do it! Can’t do it!

7550
04:24:30,060 --> 04:24:31,910
What’s going on back there? Oh my asshole

7551
04:24:32,710 --> 04:24:34,250
OK Arm Wrestle!!

7552
04:24:33,910 --> 04:24:34,250
Ouch

7553
04:24:39,280 --> 04:24:42,790
Which one’s making the noise!?

7554
04:24:46,420 --> 04:24:49,230
They’re really farting!!

7555
04:24:51,780 --> 04:24:53,900
Please I’ve had enough

7556
04:24:55,050 --> 04:24:56,470
Both leaders shake hands

7557
04:24:57,320 --> 04:24:59,870
A reconciled ending

7558
04:25:00,350 --> 04:25:06,140
The manly men's masculine battle comes to a close

7559
04:25:06,840 --> 04:25:10,780
Heading into the next day, while it is raining at the research facility,

7560
04:25:08,000 --> 04:25:12,150
Science Research Facility: 16 hours 30 minutes of service

7561
04:25:10,780 --> 04:25:14,720
inside, the five awaits their final challenge.

7562
04:25:18,440 --> 04:25:27,030
A sudden blackout

7563
04:25:18,460 --> 04:25:19,090
What happened?

7564
04:25:19,090 --> 04:25:21,730
Holy shit, this is scary!

7565
04:25:19,710 --> 04:25:21,030
Bang

7566
04:25:19,910 --> 04:25:21,730
What is it!?

7567
04:25:21,010 --> 04:25:22,230
This totally sucks

7568
04:25:21,730 --> 04:25:21,830
What?

7569
04:25:21,830 --> 04:25:21,930

7572
04:25:22,130 --> 04:25:23,690
What?

7573
04:25:22,530 --> 04:25:22,690
Who?

7574
04:25:22,690 --> 04:25:22,860
Who?

7575
04:25:22,860 --> 04:25:23,030
Who?

7576
04:25:23,030 --> 04:25:23,190
Who?

7577
04:25:23,190 --> 04:25:23,360
Who?

7578
04:25:23,360 --> 04:25:23,530
Who?

7579
04:25:23,530 --> 04:25:23,690
Who?

7580
04:25:23,690 --> 04:25:24,230
OMG shit shit

04:25:27,200 --> 04:25:28,500
Bang

7585
04:25:28,070 --> 04:25:30,270
The hell is this?

7586
04:25:31,840 --> 04:25:35,840
Hosei and Endo have disappeared

7587
04:25:33,450 --> 04:25:34,440
What is it

7588
04:25:35,940 --> 04:25:38,710
Where are Hosei and Endo heading to..?

7589
04:25:38,980 --> 04:25:39,310
OMG

7590
04:25:39,310 --> 04:25:39,580
OMG

OMG

7593
04:25:40,110 --> 04:25:41,350
OMG

7594
04:25:41,700 --> 04:25:45,800
Kidnapped by Masked Men

7595
04:25:46,870 --> 04:25:47,770
What what

7596
04:25:46,870 --> 04:25:51,260
The remaining 3 people are left with smartphones…

7597
04:25:53,310 --> 04:25:58,080
At a certain secret base

7598
04:26:06,940 --> 04:26:08,110
Mr. Matsumoto, Mr. Hamada, Mr. Tanaka

7599
04:26:08,110 --> 04:26:09,290
Mr. Matsumoto, Mr. Hamada, Mr. Tanaka

7600
04:26:09,290 --> 04:26:10,170
Mr. Matsumoto, Mr. Hamada, Mr. Tanaka

7601
04:26:10,420 --> 04:26:14,580
I am the world’s scariest scientist, Terada Kokoro

7602
04:26:10,420 --> 04:26:14,580
TERADA KOKORO

7603
04:26:10,420 --> 04:26:14,580
The world’s scariest scientist

7604
04:26:14,580 --> 04:26:19,200
Mr. Endo and Hosei are

7605
04:26:16,450 --> 04:26:19,200
in the good hands of my minions

7606
04:26:18,050 --> 04:26:20,370
He just said Hosei

7607
04:26:19,380 --> 04:26:24,060
Mr. Endo and Hosei are

7608
04:26:21,620 --> 04:26:24,060
your good pals, right?

7609
04:26:24,060 --> 04:26:24,740
That is why

7610
04:26:24,740 --> 04:26:26,890
I will give you all a chance!!

7611
04:26:26,910 --> 04:26:30,390
If you can find

7612
04:26:26,910 --> 04:26:30,390
a key in this building,

7613
04:26:30,390 --> 04:26:33,330
Mr. Endo and Hosei will be returned to you

7614
04:26:33,900 --> 04:26:36,100
On your tables you will find

7615
04:26:36,100 --> 04:26:39,120
Please take these with you as you go!

7616
04:26:36,100 --> 04:26:39,120
your smartphones.

7617
04:26:39,320 --> 04:26:39,940
That! That’s it!

7618
04:26:39,940 --> 04:26:40,400
That! That’s it!

7619
04:26:40,400 --> 04:26:41,810
That’s it!

7620
04:26:54,420 --> 04:26:59,340
Little Kokoro's tricks

7621
04:26:56,070 --> 04:26:56,990
Tricks?

7622
04:27:01,610 --> 04:27:04,300
I forgot to mention one thing!

7623
04:27:04,300 --> 04:27:06,400
From here on out, laughing is okay, but

7624
04:27:06,400 --> 04:27:08,050
If you get frightened, you are out!

7625
04:27:08,450 --> 04:27:12,070
Please look after each other

7626
04:27:09,830 --> 04:27:12,070
and take care as you set off!

7627
04:27:12,840 --> 04:27:14,110
Shock!

7628
04:27:14,110 --> 04:27:15,910
Can’t believe you got shocked by television static, man

7629
04:27:15,910 --> 04:27:19,180
Can’t believe you got shocked by television static, man

7630
04:27:17,120 --> 04:27:19,180
Yeah he got shocked by that but also

7631
04:27:19,180 --> 04:27:21,550
When Little Kokoro threw that blue thing

7632
04:27:21,550 --> 04:27:24,180
You dodged, didn’t you?

7633
04:27:23,910 --> 04:27:26,220
I didn’t dodge though

7634
04:27:26,770 --> 04:27:28,390
With you two doing this together is gonna be bloody tough

7635
04:27:28,390 --> 04:27:31,140
With you two doing this together is gonna be bloody tough

7636
04:27:31,440 --> 04:27:33,440
MIDNIGHT SPECIAL RULE

7637
04:27:31,740 --> 04:27:33,920
MIDNIGHT SPECIAL RULE

7638
04:27:32,990 --> 04:27:37,700
ABSOLUTELY DO NOT BE FRIGHTENED

7639
04:27:33,460 --> 04:27:37,700
PROFESSORS OF SCIENCE

7640
04:27:33,920 --> 04:27:37,700
Absolutely Do Not Be Frightened Professors of Science

7641
04:27:38,280 --> 04:27:43,370
RETRIEVE THE KEY: HOSEI & ENDO TO BE RESCUED

7642
04:27:38,280 --> 04:27:43,370
These 3 will retrieve the key to rescue Hosei and Endo

7643
04:27:43,520 --> 04:27:43,730
I’m in your hands

7644
04:27:43,820 --> 04:27:47,370
A moment of worry

7645
04:27:43,880 --> 04:27:47,710
With the two waiting to be rescued, they are faced with a moment of worry

7646
04:27:47,710 --> 04:27:50,370
I wonder if Tanaka's going to be okay

7647
04:27:50,540 --> 04:27:51,380
Every year, he gets scared so easily. Every year...

7648
04:27:51,380 --> 04:27:53,940
Every year, he gets scared so easily. Every year...

7649
04:27:54,110 --> 04:27:56,750
That worry is his partner...

7650
04:27:54,600 --> 04:27:56,750
That worry is his partner

7651
04:27:57,420 --> 04:28:00,220
Can I be in the middle of you guys?

7652
04:27:58,700 --> 04:28:00,220
No, no fuckin' way

7653
04:28:00,230 --> 04:28:00,890
Tanaka will go “Ahhhhh” SMASH

7654
04:28:00,890 --> 04:28:02,540
Tanaka will go “Ahhhhh” SMASH

7655
04:28:02,540 --> 04:28:04,260
Tanaka will go “Ahhhhh” SMASH

7656
04:28:04,260 --> 04:28:04,940
And here will be like BANG! driving his elbow in

7657
04:28:04,940 --> 04:28:05,860
And here will be like BANG! driving his elbow in

7658
04:28:05,860 --> 04:28:09,560
And here will be like BANG! driving his elbow in

7659
04:28:08,380 --> 04:28:09,560
Man that is always the case...

7660
04:28:10,080 --> 04:28:15,050
The world's scariest scientist is watching from the secret location

7661
04:28:10,090 --> 04:28:15,230
From the secret base, the five’s movements are being monitored

7662
04:28:15,120 --> 04:28:19,540
We will go like this, okay? Going out there like this is good.

7663
04:28:16,680 --> 04:28:19,540
Like this

7664
04:28:19,720 --> 04:28:22,940
Research Facility 2nd floor hallway

7665
04:28:23,560 --> 04:28:24,810
Man, this room...

7666
04:28:24,880 --> 04:28:30,780
Mail Received

7667
04:28:25,710 --> 04:28:27,680
You've got mail!

7668
04:28:28,200 --> 04:28:29,130
Mail?

7669
04:28:29,130 --> 04:28:30,770
Oh here it is!

7670
04:28:30,880 --> 04:28:38,860
It's awesome!

7671
04:28:32,980 --> 04:28:34,920
The hell is this?

7672
04:28:35,220 --> 04:28:38,860
Nadaru...

7673
04:28:36,350 --> 04:28:38,860
It's their

7674
04:28:37,170 --> 04:28:38,860
sticker, isn't it?

7675
04:28:39,040 --> 04:28:43,180
Until the hidden prank

7676
04:28:39,340 --> 04:28:41,760
Tanaka, come in front

7677
04:28:48,200 --> 04:28:51,420
Nadaru appears breaking through the wall

7678
04:28:48,370 --> 04:28:49,400
It's awesome!

7679
04:28:49,400 --> 04:28:51,790
Come on, man, not that...

7680
04:28:50,280 --> 04:28:51,790
It's awesome!

7681
04:28:51,920 --> 04:28:53,440
Awesome hallway! It's awesome!!

7682
04:28:53,440 --> 04:28:54,890
Awesome hallway! It's awesome!!

7683
04:28:54,890 --> 04:28:57,880
Partner Nishino calms Nadaru down

7684
04:28:55,190 --> 04:28:57,880
Awesome hallway! It's awesome!

7685
04:28:57,880 --> 04:28:58,880
This thing you're doing, enough already man

7686
04:28:58,880 --> 04:29:01,330
This thing you're doing, enough already man

7687
04:29:01,580 --> 04:29:03,750
This hallway is so awesome!!

7688
04:29:04,430 --> 04:29:06,430
Confinement Room

7689
04:29:04,500 --> 04:29:08,070
Hosei and Endo are in relaxation mode

7690
04:29:04,770 --> 04:29:08,070
The two are in relaxation mode

7691
04:29:08,690 --> 04:29:10,220
Man, my wife made an appearance

7692
04:29:10,220 --> 04:29:11,860
Man, my wife made an appearance

7693
04:29:11,860 --> 04:29:14,360
Man, my wife made an appearance

7694
04:29:14,230 --> 04:29:16,010
That's right...

7695
04:29:16,010 --> 04:29:19,130
She was the only one I never wanted to appear on this show

7696
04:29:19,380 --> 04:29:20,360
My whole life gets broadcasted on the last day of the year

7697
04:29:20,360 --> 04:29:20,830
My whole life gets broadcasted on the last day of the year

7698
04:29:20,830 --> 04:29:23,100
My whole life gets broadcasted on the last day of the year

7699
04:29:23,630 --> 04:29:28,390
All your private things are revealed and put out there...

7700
04:29:28,440 --> 04:29:31,480
It does feel like your life is being put on display

7701
04:29:31,660 --> 04:29:36,910
Special Building 2nd floor hallway

7702
04:29:31,980 --> 04:29:33,710
Tanaka, get in front already!

7703
04:29:33,710 --> 04:29:36,910
Tanaka, get in front already!

7704
04:29:34,380 --> 04:29:34,650
I'm okay

7705
04:29:34,650 --> 04:29:36,910
I'm okay

7706
04:29:35,430 --> 04:29:36,910
Even if you say you're okay...

7707
04:29:36,930 --> 04:29:40,550
I feel scared even if Tanaka is in front, 'cuz he’s gonna run back towards us anyway

7708
04:29:40,550 --> 04:29:42,450
Why is there a chair here?

7709
04:29:40,730 --> 04:29:43,990
A curious chair

7710
04:29:42,570 --> 04:29:44,240
Gotta get my shit together

7711
04:29:44,050 --> 04:29:44,860
Tanaka

7712
04:29:44,740 --> 04:29:48,880
Mail Received

7713
04:29:44,860 --> 04:29:46,860
Yes?

7714
04:29:49,030 --> 04:29:53,700
Please discuss between the three of you, about who will be waiting in the chair

7715
04:29:53,830 --> 04:29:55,870
Tanaka!!

7716
04:29:56,980 --> 04:30:01,010
“All of us to discuss,” it says there

7717
04:29:58,020 --> 04:30:01,010
We have to discuss!!

7718
04:30:02,310 --> 04:30:02,840
Say scissors, paper or rock!!

7719
04:30:03,760 --> 04:30:05,910
Hamada

7720
04:30:03,760 --> 04:30:05,910
Matsumoto

7721
04:30:03,760 --> 04:30:05,910
Tanaka

7722
04:30:05,910 --> 04:30:09,610
Alright, Tanaka, you go!!

7723
04:30:09,610 --> 04:30:10,780
It was a tie!

7724
04:30:10,780 --> 04:30:12,550
It was a tie!!

7725
04:30:12,550 --> 04:30:15,290
You have to appreciate the fact that

7726
04:30:13,600 --> 04:30:15,290
we played "Rock-Paper-Scissors" for your sake

7727
04:30:15,590 --> 04:30:17,590
"All of us to discuss," it said...

7728
04:30:19,220 --> 04:30:25,400
Mysterious Countdown

7729
04:30:19,220 --> 04:30:25,400
m 0 0 l 1359 0 l 1359 169.5 l 0 169.5 l 0 0

7730
04:30:19,590 --> 04:30:20,740
Wha--

7731
04:30:20,440 --> 04:30:22,140
Scary...

7732
04:30:25,000 --> 04:30:25,660
Scary

7733
04:30:31,350 --> 04:30:32,390
You were shivering too much

7734
04:30:34,870 --> 04:30:35,870
You have mail!

7735
04:30:38,340 --> 04:30:44,680
Dummy~! Idiot~!

7736
04:30:38,340 --> 04:30:44,680
Move ahead!!

7737
04:30:38,340 --> 04:30:44,680
Nothing happened~

7738
04:30:38,340 --> 04:30:44,680
m 0 0 l 397.5 0 l 397.5 300 l 0 300 l 0 0

7739
04:30:38,540 --> 04:30:39,590
"Dummy~! Idiot~!"

7740
04:30:39,910 --> 04:30:41,160
"Nothing happened~"

7741
04:30:41,160 --> 04:30:42,580
"Move ahead!"

7742
04:30:42,580 --> 04:30:44,680
So irritating

7743
04:30:44,680 --> 04:30:46,750
It was so heart-pounding. I thought they would do something like break the glass.

7744
04:30:46,750 --> 04:30:49,600
It was so heart-pounding. I thought they would do something like break the glass.

7745
04:30:47,570 --> 04:30:49,700
Yeah, the anticipation...

7746
04:30:48,300 --> 04:30:49,700
Yeah, of course

7747
04:30:49,600 --> 04:30:52,760
Notice board

7748
04:30:49,800 --> 04:30:52,760
Special wing, 2nd floor

7749
04:30:50,070 --> 04:30:50,820
I don't like this

7750
04:30:50,350 --> 04:30:51,360
This is the worst

7751
04:30:52,220 --> 04:30:52,740
What is it?

7752
04:30:52,760 --> 04:30:56,660
Hamada and Tanaka, go up!!

7753
04:30:52,760 --> 04:30:56,660
Matsumoto, go down!

7754
04:30:52,770 --> 04:30:54,840
It says "Matsumoto, go down!"

7755
04:30:54,840 --> 04:30:56,660
and "Hamada and Tanaka, go up!!"

7756
04:30:54,990 --> 04:30:58,360
Ah, so you split up here. That has to be scary.

7757
04:30:56,710 --> 04:30:59,360
This is bad

7758
04:30:57,610 --> 04:31:00,030
No no no no no

7759
04:31:00,030 --> 04:31:01,980
Being alone's bad, but I don't like going with Tanaka either

7760
04:31:01,980 --> 04:31:04,030
Being alone's bad, but I don't like going with Tanaka either

7761
04:31:04,600 --> 04:31:08,520
1st floor route

7762
04:31:04,600 --> 04:31:08,520
2nd floor route

7763
04:31:04,600 --> 04:31:08,520
Split up and search for the key

7764
04:31:04,600 --> 04:31:08,520
m 0 0 l 1684.5 0 l 1684.5 147 l 0 147 l 0 0

7765
04:31:04,650 --> 04:31:08,020
From here, they split up in order to search for the key

7766
04:31:08,520 --> 04:31:10,910
Are you okay, Matsumoto-san?

7767
04:31:09,120 --> 04:31:12,090
What does it mean by "go down"?

7768
04:31:09,540 --> 04:31:12,130
There's no way I'm okay with this

7769
04:31:11,540 --> 04:31:13,410
I think it means to go that way, following the arrow

7770
04:31:12,390 --> 04:31:13,910
The arrow... so to the right?

7771
04:31:14,060 --> 04:31:16,810
Going without a protector...

7772
04:31:19,380 --> 04:31:20,000
for elbows, knees, head... scary

7773
04:31:20,000 --> 04:31:21,290
for elbows, knees, head... scary

7774
04:31:21,290 --> 04:31:21,950
for elbows, knees, head... scary

7775
04:31:21,950 --> 04:31:24,290
for elbows, knees, head... scary

7776
04:31:24,720 --> 04:31:25,520
Us too. Let's go up.

7777
04:31:25,520 --> 04:31:27,120
Us too. Let's go up.

7778
04:31:25,890 --> 04:31:27,140
My... my hands

7779
04:31:27,240 --> 04:31:29,910
Why is it always raining at times like this?

7780
04:31:31,030 --> 04:31:35,970
Special wing, 1st floor, outer corridor

7781
04:31:33,630 --> 04:31:34,980
It's so damp...

7782
04:31:36,900 --> 04:31:37,600
Uwaah!! It's scary.

7783
04:31:37,600 --> 04:31:39,540
Uwaah!! It's scary.

7784
04:31:39,970 --> 04:31:44,310
Matsumoto, who is jumping
at his own shadow

7785
04:31:39,970 --> 04:31:44,310
m 0 0 l 1359 0 l 1359 169.5 l 0 169.5 l 0 0

7786
04:31:43,340 --> 04:31:44,990
I really hated the windows

7787
04:31:45,080 --> 04:31:45,690
Last year, it was both of us too, wasn't it?

7788
04:31:45,690 --> 04:31:48,110
Last year, it was both of us too, wasn't it?

7789
04:31:48,110 --> 04:31:52,480
You're not moving forward at all

7790
04:31:50,860 --> 04:31:52,480
Please move forward

7791
04:31:51,880 --> 04:31:52,900
Why should I?

7792
04:31:52,830 --> 04:31:54,500
There's something there

7793
04:31:53,950 --> 04:31:55,040
He's our sempai

7794
04:31:54,000 --> 04:31:57,520
Mystery lockers

7795
04:31:54,990 --> 04:31:55,920
What's that?

7796
04:31:56,300 --> 04:31:57,270
Eh? Seriously...

7797
04:31:57,600 --> 04:32:01,060
I don't know... Don't push me...

7798
04:31:58,620 --> 04:32:00,290
Peek in!!

7799
04:32:01,290 --> 04:32:02,190
You have mail!

7800
04:32:04,160 --> 04:32:08,780
Hamada, open

7801
04:32:04,160 --> 04:32:08,780
locker number 2

7802
04:32:04,430 --> 04:32:08,080
In the mail, there was an instruction for Hamada to open locker number 2

7803
04:32:08,780 --> 04:32:11,700
locker number 2

7804
04:32:09,070 --> 04:32:10,900
I can't reach it. Do it, Tanaka

7805
04:32:10,350 --> 04:32:11,650
With this, you can reach it

7806
04:32:12,920 --> 04:32:13,720
Really?

7807
04:32:13,450 --> 04:32:14,540
Yes, you can reach it

7808
04:32:13,620 --> 04:32:14,720
Bad feeling about this

7809
04:32:14,620 --> 04:32:15,920
See, you can reach it

7810
04:32:22,250 --> 04:32:30,950
A 2m tall Hamada appears
from the locker

7811
04:32:22,250 --> 04:32:30,950

Here's the exit

7973
04:36:37,200 --> 04:36:43,040
Are the 2 allies?

7974
04:36:38,600 --> 04:36:41,920
Just when you'd think the 2 had come to the rescue...

7975
04:36:38,750 --> 04:36:43,040
Or enemies?

7976
04:36:43,170 --> 04:36:44,390

7984
04:37:04,310 --> 04:37:07,030
Matsumoto-san is now alone, will he be okay?

7985
04:37:05,460 --> 04:37:06,560
Perhaps...

7986
04:37:11,270 --> 04:37:12,700
Uwah it's Matsumoto!!

7987
04:37:12,700 --> 04:37:13,600

04:37:16,240 --> 04:37:17,420
Eh? Something's happening?

7991
04:37:18,940 --> 04:37:22,600
Currently creating a clone of Matsumoto Hitoshi

7992
04:37:22,310 --> 04:37:23,010
Clone?

7993
04:37:23,150 --> 04:37:26,900
In the process of creating
a clone of Matsumoto

7994
04:37:23,150 --> 04:37:26,900
m 0 0 l 1356 0 l 1356 169.5 l 0 169.5 l 0 0

7995
04:37:23,230 --> 04:37:24,110
A clone's being made?

7996
04:37:24,130 --> 04:37:24,930
What?

7997
04:37:29,540 --> 04:37:33,440
The production of a clone of Matsumoto Hitoshi is now complete

7998
04:37:34,890 --> 04:37:38,900
Clone of Matsumoto: completed

7999
04:37:34,890 --> 04:37:38,900
m 0 0 l 1356 0 l 1356 169.5 l 0 169.5 l 0 0

8000
04:37:39,410 --> 04:37:40,830
Hamada, Tanaka!

8001
04:37:41,230 --> 04:37:41,680
It's me. Me. I'm Matsumoto Hitoshi!!

8002
04:37:41,680 --> 04:37:41,930
It's me. Me. I'm Matsumoto Hitoshi!!

8003
04:37:41,930 --> 04:37:42,830
It's me. Me. I'm Matsumoto Hitoshi!!

8004
04:37:42,830 --> 04:37:45,640
It's me. Me. I'm Matsumoto Hitoshi!!

8005
04:37:43,830 --> 04:37:45,640
Help me!

8006
04:37:45,640 --> 04:37:50,590
Changed from Matsumoto
to Matsuno Akemi

8007
04:37:45,640 --> 04:37:50,590
m 0 0 l 1470 0 l 1470 169.5 l 0 169.5 l 0 0

8008
04:37:46,920 --> 04:37:47,870
Help me!

8009
04:37:49,020 --> 04:37:50,690
This is agonizing...

8010
04:37:51,830 --> 04:37:53,490
Really, how long were you going to let me wait?

8011
04:37:53,560 --> 04:37:57,610
A clone (of Matsumoto)?

8012
04:37:54,810 --> 04:37:57,810
Seems like this person is Matsumoto's clone

8013
04:37:57,630 --> 04:37:58,630
Let's head off!

8014
04:37:58,820 --> 04:38:03,450
Off to search together
with Matsumoto's clone

8015
04:37:58,820 --> 04:38:03,450
m 0 0 l 1492.5 0 l 1492.5 169.5 l 0 169.5 l 0 0

8016
04:37:58,980 --> 04:37:59,900
To find the two of them

8017
04:38:00,450 --> 04:38:01,230
How noisy

8018
04:38:01,250 --> 04:38:03,350
Noisy...

8019
04:38:01,840 --> 04:38:03,270
Let's go! Let's go!

8020
04:38:03,620 --> 04:38:10,690
Bridging corridor

8021
04:38:04,470 --> 04:38:05,270
Hm? What?

8022
04:38:05,610 --> 04:38:06,340
You have mail!

8023
04:38:06,370 --> 04:38:06,940
A new message's arrived

8024
04:38:07,320 --> 04:38:15,680
Super rare monsters

8025
04:38:07,320 --> 04:38:15,680
are approaching

8026
04:38:07,320 --> 04:38:15,680
m 0 0 l 397.5 0 l 397.5 300 l 0 300 l 0 0

8027
04:38:07,340 --> 04:38:08,940
"Super rare monsters"...

8028
04:38:08,010 --> 04:38:09,740
..."are approaching"

8029
04:38:10,060 --> 04:38:10,860
Eh, seriously?

8030
04:38:10,690 --> 04:38:13,100
What's this?

8031
04:38:12,930 --> 04:38:14,650
I'm Matsumoto Hitoshi. I was waiting!!

8032
04:38:14,030 --> 04:38:15,120
Yeah we know...

8033
04:38:14,650 --> 04:38:15,680
I'm Matsumoto Hitoshi. I was waiting!!

8034
04:38:15,380 --> 04:38:17,000
Matsumoto-san, are you okay?

8035
04:38:16,430 --> 04:38:19,900
You people, please stop there!!

8036
04:38:16,430 --> 04:38:19,900
You people, please stop there!!

8037
04:38:20,100 --> 04:38:21,120
What is it?

8038
04:38:22,070 --> 04:38:24,270
They appeared!!

8039
04:38:22,470 --> 04:38:24,270
Sexy!!

8040
04:38:25,690 --> 04:38:31,420
We are Sexy Monsters: the Kano sisters

8041
04:38:25,690 --> 04:38:31,420
We are Sexy Monsters: the Kano sisters

8042
04:38:28,180 --> 04:38:29,360
Super rare monsters!!

8043
04:38:29,360 --> 04:38:31,420
Super rare monsters!!

8044
04:38:30,060 --> 04:38:31,530
Yeah

8045
04:38:30,360 --> 04:38:31,080
Super rare...

8046
04:38:32,620 --> 04:38:37,870
Mikachuu

8047
04:38:34,800 --> 04:38:37,870
Thunderbolt

8048
04:38:36,000 --> 04:38:36,900
What?

8049
04:38:45,210 --> 04:38:47,430
Matsumoto got hit

8050
04:38:46,110 --> 04:38:47,030
Yeah

8051
04:38:48,380 --> 04:38:49,130
Huh??

8052
04:38:49,530 --> 04:38:50,600
Getting up?

8053
04:38:49,830 --> 04:38:50,600
Getting up?

8054
04:38:50,700 --> 04:38:54,120
Matsumoto's clone left the key
to the two of them

8055
04:38:50,700 --> 04:38:54,120
m 0 0 l 1365 0 l 1365 169.5 l 0 169.5 l 0 0

8056
04:38:50,850 --> 04:38:51,470
This...

8057
04:38:51,470 --> 04:38:52,440
the key...

8058
04:38:52,750 --> 04:38:53,570
Huh? Matsumoto-san...

8059
04:38:54,120 --> 04:38:54,120
Yes...

8060
04:38:54,120 --> 04:38:56,770
Go save the two of them. I'm Matsumoto Hitoshi!!

8061
04:38:55,970 --> 04:38:56,590
Right!

8062
04:38:56,770 --> 04:38:59,710
Go save the two of them. I'm Matsumoto Hitoshi!!

8063
04:38:59,140 --> 04:38:59,590
Right!

8064
04:38:59,740 --> 04:39:00,710
Seriously, what the--?

8065
04:39:01,850 --> 04:39:02,660
Mikachuu-san, shall we go?

8066
04:39:02,660 --> 04:39:06,180
Mikachuu-san, shall we go?

8067
04:39:03,810 --> 04:39:04,210
Yes, Big-sis-chuu-sama

8068
04:39:04,210 --> 04:39:06,180
Yes, Big-sis-chuu-sama

8069
04:39:06,180 --> 04:39:10,370
The clone died;
the super rare monsters retreat

8070
04:39:06,180 --> 04:39:10,370
m 0 0 l 1582.5 0 l 1582.5 169.5 l 0 169.5 l 0 0

8071
04:39:07,250 --> 04:39:09,050
So the clone died...

8072
04:39:09,100 --> 04:39:10,170
Yeah, that's how it is

8073
04:39:14,620 --> 04:39:16,560
What did the clone say?

8074
04:39:15,090 --> 04:39:16,560
No, I didn't understand

8075
04:39:16,590 --> 04:39:19,660
I don't get it at all

8076
04:39:17,640 --> 04:39:18,560
Yeah

8077
04:39:19,660 --> 04:39:23,000
Putting Matsumoto's clone aside

8078
04:39:22,030 --> 04:39:22,930
That's right

8079
04:39:23,080 --> 04:39:23,730
Matsumoto... They smelled really lovely

8080
04:39:23,100 --> 04:39:23,730
Matsumoto...

8081
04:39:23,730 --> 04:39:28,710
Matsumoto... They smelled really lovely

8082
04:39:25,350 --> 04:39:27,120
To think they'd smell this good... the Kano Sisters

8083
04:39:27,120 --> 04:39:28,710
To think they'd smell this good... the Kano Sisters

8084
04:39:28,710 --> 04:39:29,470
No--

8085
04:39:30,140 --> 04:39:31,090
Ah I hear them

8086
04:39:30,990 --> 04:39:31,940
They're nearby

8087
04:39:32,080 --> 04:39:32,690
Matsumoto-san Hamada -san, Tanaka!!

8088
04:39:32,690 --> 04:39:33,280
Matsumoto-san, Hamada-san, Tanaka!!

8089
04:39:33,280 --> 04:39:36,250
Matsumoto-san, Hamada-san, Tanaka!!

8090
04:39:34,210 --> 04:39:34,780
Okay!

8091
04:39:34,800 --> 04:39:37,430
Endo and Yamasaki had a much easier time of it...

8092
04:39:34,960 --> 04:39:36,710
Over here, we're here!

8093
04:39:37,010 --> 04:39:38,220
Help us!

8094
04:39:39,320 --> 04:39:40,550
Help us!

8095
04:39:41,050 --> 04:39:41,940
We're sorry...

8096
04:39:41,990 --> 04:39:42,650
So that's how it is

8097
04:39:43,920 --> 04:39:45,820
There was a woman's voice

8098
04:39:45,820 --> 04:39:49,960
Ah... that was Matsumoto's clone!!

8099
04:39:47,590 --> 04:39:48,210
Eh? Clone?

8100
04:39:50,140 --> 04:39:54,380
Using the key, they were safely rescued

8101
04:39:50,140 --> 04:39:54,380
Using the key, they were safely rescued

8102
04:39:51,680 --> 04:39:53,250
Matsumoto was captured as well...

8103
04:39:53,380 --> 04:39:54,210
You have mail!

8104
04:39:54,460 --> 04:39:55,880
and a clone or something appeared...

8105
04:39:55,880 --> 04:39:57,980
...the clone was a woman and small sized...

8106
04:39:57,650 --> 04:39:58,320
Yeah

8107
04:39:58,000 --> 04:39:58,400
What is it?

8108
04:39:58,030 --> 04:40:02,320
Check the video

8109
04:39:58,030 --> 04:40:02,320
m 0 0 l 397.5 0 l 397.5 300 l 0 300 l 0 0

8110
04:39:58,030 --> 04:40:02,320
on Tanaka's
smartphone

8111
04:39:58,450 --> 04:40:01,150
"Check the video on Tanaka's smartphone"

8112
04:40:01,220 --> 04:40:02,320
Ah you received some sort of file

8113
04:40:02,470 --> 04:40:03,360
Yeah

8114
04:40:03,110 --> 04:40:04,220
I received it too

8115
04:40:04,340 --> 04:40:05,740
Let's play the video

8116
04:40:06,040 --> 04:40:06,660
Hm?

8117
04:40:09,260 --> 04:40:10,760
It's Kokoro-kun...

8118
04:40:09,260 --> 04:40:12,030
T/N: The boy is Terada Kokoro, a popular child actor

8119
04:40:12,230 --> 04:40:13,500
Everything went smoothly, just as I expected

8120
04:40:13,500 --> 04:40:15,950
Everything went smoothly, just as I expected

8121
04:40:15,950 --> 04:40:17,550
Endo and Hosei were just decoys

8122
04:40:17,550 --> 04:40:19,360
Endo and Hosei were just decoys

8123
04:40:19,360 --> 04:40:21,830
They want to cut you guys off.

8124
04:40:21,940 --> 04:40:24,160
The person I really wanted to capture

8125
04:40:24,160 --> 04:40:24,830
is this!!!

8126
04:40:28,570 --> 04:40:30,000
Sorry guys. I got caught!!

8127
04:40:30,000 --> 04:40:31,640
Sorry guys. I got caught!!

8128
04:40:31,800 --> 04:40:33,800
Hurry up and save me!!

8129
04:40:33,800 --> 04:40:34,570
Fujiwara-san, be quiet!

8130
04:40:34,570 --> 04:40:36,520
Fujiwara-san, be quiet!

8131
04:40:46,020 --> 04:40:49,890
Kokoro-kun's trick (second time)

8132
04:40:52,720 --> 04:40:54,540
And now if you don't hurry up,

8133
04:40:54,540 --> 04:40:55,790
And now if you don't hurry up,

8134
04:40:56,130 --> 04:40:57,110
I'll use Fujiwara-san for my experiments!!

8135
04:40:57,110 --> 04:40:58,900
I'll use Fujiwara-san for my experiments!!

8136
04:40:59,500 --> 04:41:01,260
This year's "No laughing"



is nearing its conclusion.

8137
04:41:01,260 --> 04:41:03,370
This year's "No laughing"







is nearing its conclusion.ASDFQWERASDF

8138
04:41:03,370 --> 04:41:05,640
Good luck!!

8139
04:41:05,900 --> 04:41:07,600
It's getting cold outside so be careful!!

8140
04:41:07,600 --> 04:41:09,210
It's getting cold outside so be careful!!

8141
04:41:09,210 --> 04:41:11,980
What is this?

8142
04:41:10,020 --> 04:41:11,980
If that's the case...

8143
04:41:12,380 --> 04:41:14,710
Matsumoto-san?

8144
04:41:14,710 --> 04:41:16,710
He got cloned and then...

8145
04:41:18,580 --> 04:41:21,550
It was me

8146
04:41:19,280 --> 04:41:21,550
I'm sorry, really, I just...

8147
04:41:20,300 --> 04:41:21,550
That anxious feeling...

8148
04:41:21,550 --> 04:41:22,700
It comes out

subconsciously. Sorry.

8149
04:41:22,700 --> 04:41:24,470
It comes out





subconsciously. Sorry.

8150
04:41:23,420 --> 04:41:24,470
It stinks!

8151
04:41:24,470 --> 04:41:25,260
It's a bodily thing. Excuse me.

8152
04:41:25,260 --> 04:41:27,420
It's a bodily thing. Excuse me.

8153
04:41:26,260 --> 04:41:28,310
You did it so naturally just now

8154
04:41:32,900 --> 04:41:40,040
Tall Hamada appears with Matsumoto

8155
04:41:38,400 --> 04:41:40,300
So damn violent

8156
04:41:41,270 --> 04:41:43,270
He got me too, just now

8157
04:41:43,890 --> 04:41:47,710
Tall Hamada leaves, laughing out loud.

8158
04:41:47,710 --> 04:41:50,510
Are you OK?

8159
04:41:50,630 --> 04:41:52,230
The key! I got it!

8160
04:41:52,230 --> 04:41:54,000
The key! I got it!

8161
04:41:54,200 --> 04:41:54,820
So let's go and save Fujiwara at the yard.

8162
04:41:54,820 --> 04:41:57,070
So let's go and save Fujiwara at the yard.

8163
04:41:56,920 --> 04:41:58,120
Oh so the key is for that.

8164
04:41:58,120 --> 04:41:59,620
Fujiwara?

8165
04:41:59,620 --> 04:42:02,130
They got Fujiwara?

8166

You're just gonna go that way?

8262
04:45:11,080 --> 04:45:13,700

Please pardon me

8268
04:45:21,880 --> 04:45:23,380

8272
04:45:25,600 --> 04:45:27,280
All right, bye bye

8273
04:45:28,260 --> 04:45:31,900

It was very scary

8278
04:45:34,170 --> 04:45:35,070
If you're not told beforehand it's so damn scary

8279
04:45:35,070 --> 04:45:38,840
If you're not told beforehand it's so damn scary

8280
04:45:36,620 --> 04:45:38,420
You just fall so suddenly, huh?

8281
04:45:38,840 --> 04:45:39,840
You suddenly vanished

8282
04:45:39,840 --> 04:45:41,040

04:45:54,090 --> 04:45:55,790
Seriously, what are you doing?

8291
04:45:57,190 --> 04:46:00,330
The key...

8292
04:46:00,660 --> 04:46:03,750
The key is useless

8293
04:46:02,180 --> 04:46:03,600
It's useless...

8294
04:46:02,980 --> 04:46:03,800
Doesn't make sense

8295
04:46:03,750 --> 04:46:06,000

8349
04:47:43,230 --> 04:47:44,500
Thank you for playing with me!!

8350
04:47:44,500 --> 04:47:46,900
Bye bye!

8351
04:47:48,690 --> 04:47:53,440
Science research facility 19 hours in

8352
04:47:49,620 --> 04:47:51,520
3 o'clock at night

8353
04:47:53,940 --> 04:48:02,900
Completing their challenge as scientists

8354
04:47:54,560 --> 04:47:55,760
This year

8355
04:47:55,760 --> 04:47:59,280
the rookie scientists got through a day at the job

8356
04:47:59,280 --> 04:48:00,030
What the hell happened to everyone?

8357
04:47:59,730 --> 04:48:02,170
The five men

8358
04:48:00,550 --> 04:48:01,680
What kind of situation is this?

8359
04:48:03,150 --> 04:48:09,040
Overcoming multiple hardships...

8360
04:48:04,720 --> 04:48:07,290
overcame multiple hardships

8361
04:48:07,390 --> 04:48:08,140
and now

8362
04:48:09,390 --> 04:48:13,100
they welcome a moment of relief

8363
04:48:09,990 --> 04:48:12,700
they welcome a moment of relief

8364
04:48:13,360 --> 04:48:15,210
That camera shot was full of malice

8365
04:48:17,550 --> 04:48:18,200
Everyone

8366
04:48:18,670 --> 04:48:20,700
It was a long day of scientific training. Let's wrap it up.

8367
04:48:20,700 --> 04:48:24,270
It was a long day of scientific training. Let's wrap it up.

8368
04:48:24,770 --> 04:48:27,010
It's ove~~~r

8369
04:48:27,010 --> 04:48:28,910
Finally, it's done

8370
04:48:28,910 --> 04:48:30,060
Matsumoto, how was it?

8371
04:48:30,060 --> 04:48:30,980
Matsumoto, how was it?

8372
04:48:32,320 --> 04:48:34,000
Having to get along with a crossdressing

8373
04:48:34,000 --> 04:48:39,720
Having to get along with a crossdressing

8374
04:48:34,980 --> 04:48:39,720
partner for longer periods is a bit...

8375
04:48:39,920 --> 04:48:42,940
Because he likes it (crossdressing), it can't be helped

8376
04:48:43,090 --> 04:48:48,230
I don't want to discriminate against him.

8377
04:48:48,230 --> 04:48:49,630
He's laughing, you know

8378
04:48:49,580 --> 04:48:50,600
No way

8379
04:48:50,230 --> 04:48:51,730
So, shall we go?

8380
04:48:50,950 --> 04:48:52,650
You're totally laughing

8381
04:48:56,520 --> 04:48:58,220
It was tough!

8382
04:49:01,360 --> 04:49:03,880
It really takes a lot out of you

8383
04:49:04,680 --> 04:49:07,550
If we've come this far, then that means...

8384
04:49:07,550 --> 04:49:09,300
We're in the new year, right?

8385
04:49:07,550 --> 04:49:10,620
Research facility entrance

8386
04:49:09,300 --> 04:49:11,950
Oh yeah

8387
04:49:12,120 --> 04:49:13,170
It's 2017

8388
04:49:13,170 --> 04:49:15,890
It's 2017

8389
04:49:15,890 --> 04:49:16,740
Congratulations!

8390
04:49:17,310 --> 04:49:18,210
This year...

8391
04:49:17,790 --> 04:49:19,660
Congratulations!

8392
04:49:18,910 --> 04:49:20,210
Look who we have here

Professor Ein-suga-ein









QSuga Kenji Producer

8394
04:49:22,770 --> 04:49:24,030
This year is a rooster year.

8395
04:49:24,030 --> 04:49:26,740
This year is a rooster year.

8396
04:49:26,740 --> 04:49:27,770
And because it's a rooster year, let's have an AUWE... AIUEO composition.

8397
04:49:27,770 --> 04:49:28,270
And because it's a rooster year, let's have an AUWE... AIUEO composition.

8398

And because it's a rooster year, let's have an AUWE... AIUEO composition.

8399
04:49:30,070 --> 04:49:31,890
Of course, we should

8400
04:49:32,340 --> 04:49:32,780
Every single year!!

8401
04:49:32,780 --> 04:49:36,210
Every single year!!

8402
04:49:37,630 --> 04:49:39,080
Why...

8403
04:49:39,320 --> 04:49:40,180
It's the basic AIUEO

8404
04:49:39,320 --> 04:49:41,200
Note: AIUEO are the first letters of the Japanese alphabet, like ABC

8405
04:49:40,530 --> 04:49:41,930
For 11 years...

8406
04:49:40,680 --> 04:49:42,020
What is wrong with you?

8407
04:49:46,360 --> 04:49:49,740
AIUEO composition

8419
04:50:11,810 --> 04:50:13,470

Perfect Timing

8423
04:50:26,010 --> 04:50:26,510
They won't ease up until it's over

8424
04:50:26,510 --> 04:50:28,900
They won't ease up until it's over

8425
04:50:28,030 --> 04:50:30,030
Nope

8426
04:50:29,180 --> 04:50:30,030
It's cold

8427
04:50:30,350 --> 04:50:31,000
Let's go

8428
04:50:32,000 --> 04:50:34,420

I thought about that too, but whatever

8436
04:50:42,110 --> 04:50:44,180
They're so strict for me!

8437
04:50:46,680 --> 04:50:54,590

04:55:31,900 --> 04:55:33,290
Absolutely never

9944
04:55:34,300 --> 04:55:36,010
