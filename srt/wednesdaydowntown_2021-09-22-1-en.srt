00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:07,220
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,420
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:14,060
Who?
-Who's here?

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,370
I'm looking forward to it!
-Who is it?

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,090
It's Welcome to Koga!

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,410
We are Welcome to Koga, hello everyone!

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,720
It's Koga Ken!

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,110
Ah, thank you.
-WHAT ABOUT ME!?

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,750
Oda's here too, it's not just him

10
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,010
We are a group called Welcome to Koga

11
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,580
I was going to talk about you soon

12
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,890
Usually there is no separate introduction, right?

13
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:34,550
It's not bad, is it?

14
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,220
Why don't you just say Welcome to Koga?

15
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,320
This is the first time we were asked to come, and I'm really glad

16
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,390
Speaking of the theory we bring today

17
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,720
When you think of me, usually musical segments come to mind

18
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,000
Famous music theories of this program include

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,380
The chorus of the song happens to be a tearful difficult one

20
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,740
Yes, yes, yes, it's been done

21
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,740
Does that ring a bell?
-It does

22
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,170
This time we have a new version of that theory

23
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,160
The latest theory is "Song X Tears"

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,510
Please take a look

25
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,580
It is impossible to cry while dancing the Matsuken Samba

26
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,290
I see.
-This is a good theory

27
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:09,560
What do you all think?

28
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,250
Ah, what else can be said?

29
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,360
No, no, no, that's too much

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,140
The results are unclear, we need to see it first

31
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,190
Please chill out, Matsumoto

32
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:20,690
This is not only an upbeat song, but it's also the type that makes one feel ashamed

33
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,420
It's not shameful
-Stop it! Stop it! You can't say that!

34
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,630
There is no shame in it at all

35
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:29,780
And so, the challenge of crying Matsuken Samba unfolds

36
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,110
And

37
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,380
The "Make Your Partner Do a Double-take" Championship

38
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:58,970
It is impossible to cry while dancing the Matsuken Samba

39
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,990
This time, all the challengers will be challenged to

40
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,830
The Matsuken Samba II, which is synonymous with upbeat songs

41
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,200
They will have to dance and sing at the same time

42
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,640
For 57 seconds from the beginning of the second verse to the end of the chorus

43
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,020
Will they be able to cry?

44
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,530
And so

45
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,020
Thank you for having me

46
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,790
Ogata

47
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,120
The first challenger is

48
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,430
Panther's Ogata

49
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,150
May I ask what method you are going to use to cry?

50
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,280
Before I used cheating... the thought of my wife cheating on me

51
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,650
It was messed up

52
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,650
Something similar was done before, right?

53
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,320
On Wednesday Downtown?
-Yes

54
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,890
So I'm going to imagine my wife cheating on me

55
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,130
That's all I can do, if I want to cry

56
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,770
Really?

57
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,350
By imagining the infidelity of his beloved wife

58
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,380
Can he smoothly shed tears?

59
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,320
Not bad, not bad

60
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,090
Letting go is good

61
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,970
It's really good. It's good

62
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:15,920
Bang the bongos, play the samba, and dance the Southern Carnival

63
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,280
Pretty good

64
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,780
Not bad, very into it

65
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,780
Good appearence

66
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:25,030
No matter who you are, let's party together and start sweating glitter

67
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,890
Nice, nice performance

68
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,910
This is where it really starts

69
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:32,370
In the hot wind, I'll put my body on the line and keep dancing until I'm satisfied

70
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,970
It's brewing. It's brewing

71
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:41,120
The waves also sing the samba of love, and the heart is filled with this rhythm

72
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,620
What's going on now?

73
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,390
Yeah, it's hard to say

74
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:59,730
O-le Ole Matsuken Samba O-le Ole Matsuken Samba

75
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,800
Still dancing well

76
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,520
So funny

77
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,970
Really serious dancing

78
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,010
Not bad

79
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,970
Ah, fall in love, my friend, let's dance together, Miss

80
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,880
Only 20 seconds left!

81
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:09,480
Even forget to sleep and dance until dawn

82
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,880
No time!

83
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,540
Put more into it!

84
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,830
The dance is good

85
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:22,620
Samba Viva Samba MA-TSU-KE-N Samba O-le!

86
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,490
The dance is really good

87
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,490
Really pretty good

88
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,270
Still hasn't cried?

89
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,830
Ah no time left!

90
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,250
It's impossible!

91
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,150
It's not going to work, is it?
-It really doesn't work

92
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,560
No, no, no, it's not working

93
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,470
It's not possible

94
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,930
Impossible!

95
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,220
Of course

96
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,700
Can't do it! Dammit!

97
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,710
Defeated by Matsuken!

98
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,510
That's for sure!

99
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,940
The power of Matsuken Samba is similar to that of an excavator

100
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:52,810
Absorbing all the sadness in the world

101
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,170
The Devil's Song "Matsuken Samba"

102
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,170
What the hell is the devil's song?

103
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,170
The next challenger is

104
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,150
Who?

105
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,580
Thanks for having me

106
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,760
Doesn't seem like the crying type

107
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,080
Suzuki Mogura

108
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,800
May I ask when was the last time you cried?

109
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:15,040
Watching the movie "Major League" was particularly moving

110
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:15,040
※1989 comedy film based on MLB

111
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,060
Can't see it at all

112
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,040
Seriously?

113
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,880
Major League?

114
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,010
Yes, Major League, that's correct

115
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,080
That film came out quite a long time ago

116
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,080
Yeah

117
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,720
Indeed ... but I watched it in a small booth

118
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,790
In a small booth films feel more close

119
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,930
Doesn't crying affect the mood?

120
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,400
I was able to adjust immediately!

121
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,810
What are you talking about?

122
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,550
The mole (Mogura) who switches moods instantly

123
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,980
Can he switch quickly between laughing and crying?

124
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,240
Looks like a rich person

125
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,910
Will he cry?

126
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:57,990
Bang the bongos, play the samba, and dance the Southern Carnival

127
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,810
Impressive

128
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:07,730
No matter who you are, let's party together and start sweating glitter

129
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,420
Something fell

130
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,960
What?

131
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,090
It's not easy to cry now

132
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:05,980
Seriously

133
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,820
Too much concern

134
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:14,900
In the hot wind, I'll put my body on the line and keep dancing until I'm satisfied

135
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:24,850
The waves also sing the samba of love, and the heart is filled with this rhythm

136
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,560
What is this situation?

137
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,300
The belly is too big, the belt is gone

138
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:41,800
O-le Ole Matsuken Samba O-le Ole Matsuken Samba

139
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,730
Well...it's hopeless, right?

140
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,000
Ah, fall in love, my friend, let's dance together, Miss

141
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,850
Even forget to sleep and dance until dawn

142
00:06:51,850 --> 00:07:06,090
Samba Viva Samba MA-TSU-KE-N Samba O-le!

143
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,790
Ah but the eye sockets are wet

144
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,170
Can he cry?

145
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,810
Impossible, no time left

146
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,120
5 seconds left

147
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,230
Such a shame

148
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,690
This has been dropping since the beginning

149
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,200
Yeah

150
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,350
You'd be concerned

151
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:24,670
If I step on the microphone I may have to pay 200,000

152
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:29,210
Such distractions kept recurring in my mind

153
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,970
So I couldn't do it!

154
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,870
The next challenger is

155
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,810
There is no chance for this one, right?

156
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,020
Thank you for having me

157
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,490
Plus Minus' Iwahashi

158
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,560
May I ask what method you are going to use?

159
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:49,160
At first, I was thinking to remember my four grandparents who have passed away

160
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:54,070
But the flavor of Matsuken Samba is too overpowering, I think

161
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,790
Yeah

162
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,400
So that made me think "maybe cry tears of joy"

163
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,680
So i'm going to try shedding tears of joy through the power of Matsuken Samba

164
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,400
Good idea

165
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,620
Maybe i'll cry that way

166
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,950
I see

167
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,400
Either way, just cry

168
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,700
That's my strategy

169
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,950
Well ... as long as you can cry then its fine

170
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,240
This might be a good idea

171
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,870
But he may not be truly ready to cry

172
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,190
After all, he has to be really joyful

173
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:28,970
Bang the bongos, play the samba, and dance the Southern Carnival

174
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,180
This idea could work

175
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,180
You just have to mobilize the emotions

176
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,320
Like you're going to receive some kind of award

177
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:37,710
No matter who you are, let's party together and start sweating glitter

178
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,080
Yes that's true

179
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,850
If so, he may be successful

180
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:45,710
In the hot wind, I'll put my body on the line and keep dancing until I'm satisfied

181
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,410
Eyes as wide as a cow's balls

182
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,050
This is truly a different approach

183
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,610
A despicable approach

184
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:55,300
The waves also sing the samba of love, and the heart is filled with this rhythm

185
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,560
His eyes must be very dry

186
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,500
Such dry eyes
-Definitely a good way to get dry eyes

187
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,500
Aren't tears of joy required?

188
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:12,650
O-le Ole Matsuken Samba O-le Ole Matsuken Samba

189
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,070
This wont lead to crying, right?

190
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,010
Maybe you can't just rely on emotions

191
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,320
Indeed

192
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,010
A purely physical approach

193
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:16,420
Ah, fall in love, my friend, let's dance together, Miss

194
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:22,120
Even forget to sleep and dance until dawn

195
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,490
Is his dry eyes ready to cry?

196
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:35,470
Samba Viva Samba MA-TSU-KE-N Samba O-le!

197
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,350
So scary!

198
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,890
There's no time left. It's hopeless

199
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,040
Will anyone succeed?

200
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,410
There is not much hope

201
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,170
Not much hope indeed

202
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,640
A vile "dry eye" battle

203
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,940
Although physical means were used to try to shed tears

204
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,890
It still failed

205
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,890
This is not good!

206
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,190
You were happy right, doing the dance?

207
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,620
After all, we were dancing to such an upbeat song

208
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,750
But I still have to try and cry

209
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,200
You can all try, try at home, and then you will certainly feel what I feel

210
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,360
It's a great song!

211
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,910
What are you doing?

212
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,090
The next challenger is

213
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,090
Thank you for having me

214
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,710
Matsumoto Akiko

215
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,380
Hard to tell

216
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,720
Strange choice

217
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,410
May I ask what method you are going to use?

218
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:18,150
Although they are no longer alive

219
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,450
My parents always looked forward to seeing me on stage or on TV

220
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,720
They were very happy for me every time

221
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,850
While recalling my parents

222
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,640
Should you think of them when dancing a dance like this?

223
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:30,460
I'll concentrate on the idea of making them hear, making them see

224
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,260
And that will make me cry

225
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,930
Ah, they were singers

226
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,900
So it's like this!

227
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,020
Cute!

228
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,340
Really cute, ah so cute

229
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,730
Looks like a little kid

230
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:54,320
Bang the bongos, play the samba, and dance the Southern Carnival

231
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,110
It isn't clear yet

232
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,770
She's so suitable for this

233
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:04,390
No matter who you are, let's party together and start sweating glitter

234
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,870
Is it okay to dance this?

235
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,020
Cute

236
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,380
Seriously cute

237
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,740
Super cute!

238
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,490
Big round eyes

239
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:11,270
In the hot wind, I'll put my body on the line and keep dancing until I'm satisfied

240
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,550
Is the feeling there?

241
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,090
Can she cry?

242
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,830
She's a professional, after all

243
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:19,810
The waves also sing the samba of love, and the heart is filled with this rhythm

244
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,720
I hope Akiko can succeed at least

245
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:38,590
O-le Ole Matsuken Samba O-le Ole Matsuken Samba

246
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,540
Dancing very seriously

247
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,110
Very swift movement

248
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,620
Impressive

249
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,200
Really impressive

250
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:42,500
Ah, fall in love, my friend, let's dance together, Miss

251
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:48,340
Even forget to sleep and dance until dawn

252
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:48,340
There is a chance, there is a chance, there is still time

253
00:11:48,340 --> 00:12:01,350
Samba Viva Samba MA-TSU-KE-N Samba O-le!

254
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,960
Eye sockets are a little wet

255
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,310
10 seconds

256
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,690
No time!

257
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,640
Ah, no time!

258
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:01,630
Is it impossible?

259
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,480
She tried her best, at least

260
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,870
Nice expression

261
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,760
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.

262
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,730
No need to apologize!

263
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:13,910
By the way, Harada Ryuji came to challenge

264
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,100
Eh?

265
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,470
Really?

266
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,470
My uncle's son?

267
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:26,840
He came to my house the day before the meeting

268
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:33,310
It was Harada's mother, my husband and me

269
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,300
※Ryuji Harada was invovlved in an infidelity scandal

270
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:37,300
We conducted a "who gets the car" meeting

271
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,920
That 4WD car

272
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,950
For the testimony of her sister-in-law, Harada said this

273
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,920
There's no need to talk about such things

274
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,990
It wasn't so much a meeting as it was a session

275
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,830
Session?
-Session

276
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:47,830
What?

277
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:52,930
It's not a meeting when people are just getting together

278
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,040
I see

279
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,400
What was the topic of conversation?

280
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:59,310
I've ah...forgotten

281
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,530
You start like this!?

282
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,110
Did we need that part just now?

283
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,020
Not bad not bad

284
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,610
After all, he's an actor, so maybe he can cry

285
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,720
Yes, after all, he is an actor

286
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,430
Depends on his abilities

287
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,220
Seems to be the most likely to achieve success so far, right?

288
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:21,060
Bang the bongos, play the samba, and dance the Southern Carnival

289
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,600
Not the sound I imagined

290
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,850
Dance is a bit general

291
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:31,070
No matter who you are, let's party together and start sweating glitter.

292
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,520
Although the melody is still very steady

293
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,540
But the dance is...

294
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:38,880
In the hot wind, I'll put my body on the line and keep dancing until I'm satisfied.

295
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,610
Here we go. Here we go

296
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,470
It feels like it will work

297
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,850
I want to see it succeed

298
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,510
Suddenly into it

299
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:47,120
The waves also sing the samba of love, and the heart is filled with this rhythm

300
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,900
The possibility of success is still there

301
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,080
Not bad for an actor

302
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,610
Yeah, it's good

303
00:13:47,120 --> 00:14:05,440
O-le Ole Matsuken Samba O-le Ole Matsuken Samba

304
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,480
It's not going to work, is it? Can you cry?

305
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,850
Almost 20 seconds left

306
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,510
Ah, fall in love, my friend, let's dance together, Miss

307
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,740
You can do it!

308
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:15,320
Even forget to sleep and dance until dawn

309
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,330
Running out of time!

310
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,660
Ryuji!

311
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:28,660
Samba Viva Samba MA-TSU-KE-N Samba O-le!

312
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,340
Work harder!

313
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,300
10 seconds left!

314
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,140
Ah, there's no time.

315
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,940
What the hell is up with you?

316
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,460
No, no, no, you're too strict

317
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,240
Too strict

318
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,370
And so, the last challenger is...

319
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,930
Thank you for having me

320
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:39,980
He can do it

321
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,040
TKO Kinoshita

322
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,670
He can always cry

323
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,770
It'd be strange if he couldn't
-True

324
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,920
TKO Kinoshita

325
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,900
I still have strong emotions

326
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,510
I think I can shed a tear

327
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,140
It can be done

328
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,720
May I ask when was the last time you cried?

329
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,530
Recently i've been crying a lot

330
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:17,520
That's true

331
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,970
The last year i've been crying more than ever

332
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:19,970
Benevolence appears

333
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,610
He can do it!

334
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,820
So may I ask what method are you going to use to cry?

335
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,710
I have a 20 year old daughter

336
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,740
She's 20?

337
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,290
We haven't seen much of each other lately

338
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,760
Since when?

339
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,480
Probably before everything happened

340
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,770
After I resigned from my agency, I created a Youtube Channel

341
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:45,070
Although I deserved it

342
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,940
My apology video got 450,000 dislikes

343
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,210
Japan's most disliked video

344
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:54,110
I didn't want my daughter to see that video

345
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,650
Then I called my daughter and said, "Daddy will work hard"

346
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:02,060
"It may be harder now, but you have to work hard." After saying that

347
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,860
My daughter said, "I also disliked the video"

348
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,950
Disliked it?

349
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,770
Not bad, he can do it

350
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,290
Adding all these memories

351
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,910
Indeed.
-Yes, yes

352
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,960
Use your memories!

353
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,960
Hopefully he can vent it all here

354
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:27,750
Bang the bongos, play the samba, and dance the Southern Carnival

355
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,500
Very loud

356
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,770
Quite suitable.
-Nice

357
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:37,120
No matter who you are, let's party together and start sweating glitter

358
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,430
From here

359
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,310
Here is the important part

360
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:45,000
In the hot wind, I'll put my body on the line and keep dancing until I'm satisfied

361
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,490
Come on, come on, get in the mood

362
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,890
Think quickly

363
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:53,340
The waves are also sing the samba of love, and the heart is filled with this rhythm

364
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,400
Think fast!

365
00:16:53,340 --> 00:17:11,930
O-le Ole Matsuken Samba O-le Ole Matsuken Samba

366
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,990
He's got it

367
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,430
Emotions are evident

368
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,260
Do it!

369
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,180
Feels like it will work

370
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:15,930
Ah, let's fall in love, my friend. Let's dance together, Miss

371
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,930
How's it going? Any luck?

372
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:21,270
Even forget to sleep and dance until dawn

373
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,410
You've gotta cry!

374
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,890
Feels like it will work

375
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:34,920
Samba Viva Samba MA-TSU-KE-N Samba O-le!

376
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,580
No time left

377
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,610
No time!

378
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,900
Did he cry?

379
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,390
Cried?

380
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,390
What?

381
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,840
Just cry already!

382
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,260
Did not cry at all

383
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:49,450
I had to dance and sing and think of my daughter

384
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:53,300
Too busy!

385
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,440
Ah but after a long absence in the studio

386
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:03,310
My emotions are all messed up

387
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:10,710
Matsuken Samba is still seeking challengers!

388
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,280
Too tough!

389
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,420
Yes, no one was able to do it

390
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,040
It's true.
-What do you think?

391
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,300
If Matsuken dies then maybe someone will cry

392
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,380
No no no, it doesn't have to go that far

393
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,330
This is not the kind of project you do when someone's died.

394
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,550
It'd be impossible for them to pass on

395
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,050
Do you have any candidates in mind?

396
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,290
I think child actors should be able to do it

397
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,430
Little actors
-I guess so

398
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,110
They can get into it easier

399
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:40,330
What about overseas actors like Steven Seagal?

400
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,450
I can't imagine him crying at all

401
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,500
Why would he accept a job like this?

402
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,580
No matter what, his expression remains the same

403
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,590
No expressions at all

404
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,880
It seems that Seagal's wife hates him

405
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,710
No, no, no one knows that

406
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,660
That's bad

407
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,510
She's sick of waiting for Seagal to start conversations

408
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,260
Let's welcome the next presenter

409
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,380
Rare

410
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,120
Laughing Rice

411
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,070
It feels like it's been a long time since I've seen these two

412
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,040
This show

413
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,280
Twice or so.
-Twice?

414
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,380
The show has been running for a long time and you've only appeared twice?

415
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:22,980
Yes

416
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,040
It's your first time standing here, right?

417
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,900
First time, yes

418
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,510
First as presenters

419
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,880
What was the previous project?

420
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,940
A long time ago

421
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:34,690
The judge is very good at stopping himself from laughing

422
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,290
A theory that a judge will never laugh

423
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,690
We performed a sketch in front of a judge

424
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,810
The worst reaction ever

425
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,150
Really?

426
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,160
It was indeed very cold

427
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,980
Let's put that aside for now

428
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,400
Although a bit abrupt

429
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:51,350
In the past, there was a "something you can't help but look at twice"

430
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,970
Do you remember, Downtown?

431
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:56,410
Something was written on the green room

432
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:57,850
Written by Osamu Tezuka

433
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,850
Yes yes yes

434
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,320
It was too niche

435
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:09,030
This time brought the hypothesis about double-takes

436
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,630
The "Make Your Partner Do a Double-take" Championship

437
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,830
Maybe easier than before

438
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,540
Yes, because there is an understanding

439
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,870
What do you think, Cookie

440
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:26,420
When looking at Meruru's mouth, I saw a lot of silver teeth and couldn't help but look twice.
-That's awful

441
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,010
I don't have any

442
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,140
It's a shock, isn't it?

443
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,210
Please stop lying

444
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,240
They're showing, it's best not to open your mouth

445
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,650
So awful

446
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,320
If the tattoo on Hamada's back disappeared, I wouldn't be able to not do a double take

447
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,590
Hey, you

448
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,560
Oi!

449
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:48,250
The "Make Your Partner Do a Double-take" Championship

450
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:52,610
I'll make him unable to not do a double-take

451
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:54,970
I'll give him something he can't help but do a double-take at

452
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,680
I'm confident

453
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,590
He's pretty aware of his surroundings

454
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,560
Tsuda?
-Yes

455
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,660
A favorable situation or an annoying one

456
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,890
I'll use both of these types

457
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:10,190
In this way, I should be able to achieve my goal

458
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:13,870
Can't stare at it

459
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,780
Staring doesn't count

460
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,710
Can't help but look twice without saying anything

461
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,910
I'll make him look three or four times

462
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,380
I'll make him look six trillion times

463
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,680
Six trillion times!

464
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:34,280
These five will concoct scenarios impossible not to look at twice

465
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,040
And will target their partners

466
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:39,970
And so

467
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,970
The first challenger is

468
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,190
Diane's Yusuke

469
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,660
Each challenger prepares two seperate scenarios

470
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:55,080
What is the first?

471
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,010
Complimentary meal service

472
00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:02,020
The only complimentary meal in the lounge is white rice

473
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,650
White rice

474
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,040
We often talk about bento

475
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,150
"How's the bento? How's the free food" etc

476
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,610
It makes people angry

477
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,450
We often talk about it on the radio

478
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,460
He'll definitely pay attention to it

479
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,360
I think it will work

480
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,400
And so

481
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,220
Yusuke personally places the white rice in the best position

482
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,940
I think it will work. In this position

483
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,390
Can Tsuda not help but look at it twice?

484
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,840
You don't have to open it to know

485
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,620
He's coming

486
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,920
Here we go, here we go, here we go

487
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,360
He's put his bag down

488
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,860
Where's he going?

489
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,600
Probably to the bathroom

490
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,810
Then, after coming back from the toilet

491
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,860
In position

492
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,550
Going well

493
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:04,750
He doesn't notice the white rice as he instead goes over a fake script for 3 minutes

494
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,190
What's he doing?

495
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,490
Wiping his eyes...

496
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,080
What is this rubbing method

497
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,740
Ah, he looked twice!

498
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,740
Indeed

499
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,670
Tsuda looks twice with a frown

500
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:43,420
What's up with that look

501
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,850
Slightly pissed off...

502
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,220
Slightly pissed off...

503
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:49,020
He's probably angry because he feels like he's being looked down on

504
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,480
And after that

505
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,500
Very restless

506
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,180
This guy's eyes are so fierce

507
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,680
What's wrong?
-What's wrong?

508
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,920
It's gotten weird

509
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,760
What's going on? His movements are so disgusting

510
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,680
Say something!

511
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,790
He's looked so many times!

512
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,220
Seriously so many times

513
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,490
Picked it up

514
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,080
What's going on here?

515
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:30,100
Before even picking up the white rice, he looked at it a total of 13 times

516
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,770
Thus, the first round is a success

517
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,240
Success

518
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:40,340
Next is Yashiki's challenge

519
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:44,340
Wada Akiko looks after us

520
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,080
I'm using her name

521
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:52,320
There will be graffiti on a tag with her name on it

522
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,400
Yashiki prepares the prop himself

523
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,600
A little sloppy will be better

524
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,000
So cheesy

525
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,390
Then

526
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,000
This is his room

527
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:12,070
He's always in this room

528
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:14,080
So it should be more familiar than most rooms

529
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,540
Being wary of noise

530
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:18,810
It's common to look at who's next door

531
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:23,950
So you'd be surprised to see something like this

532
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:23,990
I see

533
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:30,660
Envoking the actions of Shimada, will this plan succeed?

534
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,860
Don't talk about "power harassment"

535
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,930
He's here, he's here

536
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,450
Will he look twice?

537
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,570
Once

538
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:51,510
He just glanced as he slipped straight into the room

539
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,000
But

540
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,000
What?

541
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,240
What's happening?

542
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,070
Does this count?

543
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,720
Can't help but look again?

544
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:21,910
The time in-between is too long right, it doesn't count

545
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,780
Not this kind of twice

546
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,780
He looked twice

547
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,130
But not in the sense of a "double-take"

548
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,470
So this attempt is a failure

549
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,860
Probably too scared to hang around there

550
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,330
Otherwise he may be considered to be involved

551
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,750
If she suddenly appeared

552
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:46,630
Next is Laughing Rice's Nishida

553
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:49,300
Tetsuo likes Buddhism

554
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,840
He has a lot of prayer beads

555
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,270
Because he carries his own beads

556
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:57,140
He'd probably be conscious of other people having it too

557
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:01,880
Like "that's a huge one"

558
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,890
You couldn't not notice this one

559
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,190
Good idea

560
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,040
I'm choosing this one

561
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:08,190
Can't miss it

562
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,180
Isn't this Samoan stuff?

563
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:18,900
And so, Tetsuo is invited out to a meeting about a fake fireworks show

564
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,090
Notice the beads, Tetsuo

565
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:24,390
※Singer

566
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:24,390
Dressed up like Naoto Inti Raymi

567
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,880
Slowly the giant prayer beads appear

568
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,710
Huge!

569
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,710
This is obvious, right?

570
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,730
What will happen?

571
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:36,150
How do you enjoy fireworks?

572
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:41,420
I don't use my phone to film it

573
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:44,120
And I won't let the people with me do it either

574
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,090
From the beginning to the end of the fireworks

575
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:50,000
Watching it through the screen

576
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,470
I've seen people like this

577
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,930
I think its really a waste

578
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:59,720
And so, the beads are shown to Tetsuo

579
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:05,650
Giant prayer beads that could be considered a small firework

580
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:08,520
Will he look twice?

581
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,460
Do you have a recommendation for a fireworks convention?

582
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,640
How can I put it? The famous place...

583
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,870
There's major fireworks conference

584
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:22,960
Did he look?

585
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,060
He saw

586
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,060
He saw it

587
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:25,570
Is this considered a look?

588
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,630
Looked then looked again

589
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:32,510
Looked twice.
-Beautiful

590
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:35,030
Although it is impossible to tell from the live monitor

591
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,960
He did indeed look twice

592
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,090
And

593
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:44,780
The three major fireworks are Toura and that one, right?

594
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:49,760
Where else?

595
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:57,320
Possibly due to being shaken up inside, he's suddenly speechless

596
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,930
That shocking?

597
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:03,340
I feel like I'm watching something I shouldn't...

598
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,430
He's even playing with his hair

599
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:08,580
After the prayer beads came out

600
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,010
The vibe got kind of weird

601
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,770
Possibly due to terror

602
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:22,110
Tetsuo doesn't dare to look at the beads again

603
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:25,390
It's power is too strong

604
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,650
It's too big.
-It's scary

605
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:31,970
Next up is Cookie

606
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:37,300
He has a habit of staring at people

607
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,540
So we should have someone stare daggers at him

608
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,440
He's very good at glaring at people

609
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:47,510
Considering his overactive eyes

610
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:50,640
Overall the best choice is

611
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,670
Shizuru's Ikeda

612
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,180
Really?

613
00:29:54,090 --> 00:30:00,470
Ikeda will be brought into the large lounge where Rossy is having a meeting

614
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,590
Later

615
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:03,860
Begin

616
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:07,050
Staring daggers at Rossy, LETS GO

617
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:16,940
He looked

618
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,120
The camera angle is too good

619
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:22,320
Can't not notice!

620
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,950
Go on, go on like that

621
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,870
Didn't realise

622
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,770
Keeps looking over here, wait a second

623
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,490
Eh?

624
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:46,370
He only looked once

625
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,610
Keeps looking over here, wait a second

626
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,830
He's laughing

627
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:56,220
So tough

628
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,650
Sorry, it was too tough
-No need to apologise

629
00:30:58,650 --> 00:30:59,980
I'm really sorry

630
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,260
In short, this time it wasn't possible

631
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,990
Yeah, sorry

632
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:07,690
Let me punch you in the stomach

633
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:13,190
Next is Lalande Saaya's first attempt

634
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:18,000
This time is special

635
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,560
Nishida respects Yamazato of Nankai Sweetheart

636
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:27,550
So, as the person who acts as an assistant to the host

637
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:30,120
Nishida will be selected

638
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,190
The plan will be stated on the whiteboard

639
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:38,260
As the focus is Nishida himself I think she'll notice

640
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,390
He'll be excited

641
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:45,160
It's deliberately not written at the top

642
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:49,270
It looks like people have been crossed out and Nishida's left

643
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:52,270
In this case, it's more difficult to not look twice

644
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,320
Very practical

645
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:56,320
At a whiteboard that someone forgot to erase

646
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,030
Can he not help but look twice?

647
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:03,870
Please wait here
-Thanks

648
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:06,050
The writer-director should be coming soon

649
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:09,000
One moment, please. Sorry.
-I'll wait

650
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,180
Hasn't looked at the whiteboard

651
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:19,860
For the next 10 minutes he doesn't look at the whiteboard

652
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,860
He's not looking

653
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:27,100
Good things are written right there!

654
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:27,860
Indeed

655
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,800
And then

656
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,790
He looked

657
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,950
Beautiful

658
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,820
Nicely done!

659
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:52,630
A textbook double-take

660
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:52,960
Laughing too

661
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:58,030
Followed by constant staring

662
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,370
Looking for ages

663
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,780
Keeps snickering

664
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,050
Always looking

665
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:14,120
Very nice

666
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,210
Kinda scary

667
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,570
And

668
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:20,390
Taking photos

669
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,730
He'd definitely do this

670
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,960
Very happy. Click, click, clicking!

671
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:32,730
He looks so pleased with himself

672
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,510
So

673
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:38,730
The results of the first round are shown above

674
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:44,580
And so begins the second round

675
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:48,080
An even bolder section

676
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,400
First up is Lalande Saaya

677
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,520
The second scenario

678
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:57,060
This time is the opposite scenario

679
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:00,070
The worst-case scenario

680
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,470
In the corridor

681
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:05,770
Suddenly there will be loads of holes in the walls and a lot of charms on the side

682
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:11,140
And so the second attempt to elicit a double-take

683
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,490
That's creepy

684
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:15,780
What will happen?

685
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:19,650
Will it work this time too?

686
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,790
This is super scary

687
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:22,920
Suddenly seeing a large number of talisman paper

688
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,920
Here we go, here we go, here we go

689
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,710
You'd have to look at something like this

690
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:42,890
He looked once

691
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:46,060
Not twice
-This is the kind of situation where you stare

692
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,370
Because the scenario is too shocking

693
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:55,640
He can't help but hold his breath

694
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,860
Standing still and staring

695
00:34:57,810 --> 00:34:58,860
I see

696
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,260
And so, the truth is revealed

697
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,930
How do you feel?

698
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,470
What?
-How about it?

699
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:09,300
What?

700
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,640
The last time you just stared

701
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:15,210
Something on the wall?

702
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:18,680
This time it's "get your partner to do a double-take"

703
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,150
I see

704
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:25,220
The first time you did a double-take, the second you just looked once

705
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:28,000
Ahh!

706
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,050
Very disappointing

707
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:32,210
So, Lalande wins one and loses one

708
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,620
Next is

709
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,530
I have confidence this time

710
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,530
Yes, this time you have to go for it

711
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:40,030
Seeing someone kneeling with female high school students on the side of the road

712
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,710
This time will involve Makkun of Bakkunmakkun

713
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,970
Why Makkun?

714
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:48,840
Makkun is the most likely person to do this, right?

715
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,040
You are bad!

716
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,810
Kneel down?

717
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:52,440
For a high school girl

718
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,300
It feels like a real scenario

719
00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:03,180
Will Rossy look twice at Makkun kneeling?

720
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,300
This is miserable for Makkun to do

721
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,170
What will happen?

722
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:11,560
Why did Tsuda wipe his eyes like that?

723
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,300
It was horrible

724
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,360
Super gross

725
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:19,460
It wasn't like wiping crust, more like chasing a runaway tick

726
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:24,430
And so, the Makkun kneeling double-take challenge begins

727
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,650
What will happen?

728
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,300
I'm really sorry. I have a family

729
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,820
The police are coming

730
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,050
Don't be so loud...

731
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,440
I'm sorry.
-I don't care

732
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,950
No no

733
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,110
What?

734
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,320
I'm sorrry

735
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,910
He looked

736
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,380
He looked twice

737
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,300
Indeed a double-take

738
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,500
You'd have to look

739
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,210
Looked once and then...

740
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,450
Looked twice

741
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:54,080
Although it took a little long

742
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,740
He couldn't help but look twice

743
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,740
I'm really sorry

744
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,410
No, no, no. Please wait

745
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:02,750
Ah, he looked, looked for the third time

746
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:05,480
The truth is revealed

747
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:04,910
Rossy

748
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,640
Thanks for your hard work

749
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,190
What the hell?

750
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,270
Thank you for your hard work

751
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:11,390
What what what?

752
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,930
Great! It worked!

753
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:13,650
What worked?

754
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:15,220
Ah, great!

755
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,650
What is, what is, what is, what is, what?

756
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,330
Did you see?

757
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:22,090
I saw, it seems that someone is being scolded

758
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,320
Who is being scolded

759
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,070
I don't know who it is...

760
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:26,870
Eh?

761
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,640
A fierce-looking guy is being scolded by a student

762
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,210
Didn't look closely

763
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:33,580
Seems like a very Tokyo thing to happen

764
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,120
It's Bakkunmakkun's Makkun

765
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,950
An impressive person

766
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:40,620
It wasn't what I thought it would be, but you couldn't help but look a few times

767
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,110
Anyway, thanks for passing!

768
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:47,840
So, Yasei Bakudan also get one success and one failure

769
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:51,460
Next is Laughing Rice's second attempt

770
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,460
To what extent will Testuo look?

771
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,640
Hello everyone, I'm Tetsuo of Laughing Rice

772
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,700
Sorry

773
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,330
Why do you have phlegm at the beginning?

774
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:03,480
Sorry

775
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,370
Cough it up before appearing on camera!

776
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:09,870
The reopening of the Nara Grocery Store

777
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,880
Testuo participates in a fake on-location shoot

778
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,760
Tetsuo is a special tourist ambassador for Nara

779
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:24,400
So he's interested in Nara more than the average person

780
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,840
"Nara's getting a new train station"

781
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,440
We made posters about it

782
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,030
And posted it in the store

783
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:39,080
He has to walk this way

784
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:42,570
He'll be surprised if he sees it

785
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,350
Indeed

786
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,510
No one else would look

787
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:56,030
Decision to open Nara Station

788
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,000
Eh?

789
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,630
Is that it?

790
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,670
It's a good thing

791
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,890
Didn't look twice, just stared

792
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:03,390
Stared

793
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:05,430
Just stared...

794
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:08,140
Is it that surprising?

795
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,940
The truth is revealed

796
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,770
Did you look?

797
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:09,440
What?

798
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,780
Have you seen it? Have you seen it? Have you seen it?

799
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,010
What what what?

800
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,650
Didn't see anything very interesting?

801
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:16,080
Saw something awesome

802
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,650
But i'm scared. I'm consistently scared

803
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,110
I'm scared, the prayer beads were huge

804
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:24,380
Still thinking about it

805
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,280
It was scary

806
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,630
No, the prayer beads were so big, so i'm still scared

807
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:32,100
People with such large prayer beads are very scary

808
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,100
And it's not easy to talk about it

809
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:37,320
Because of the prayer beads

810
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:37,320
Cared so much

811
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,810
Testuo failed to take much notice of the poster

812
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,440
Constantly thinking about it

813
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:46,290
So far it's all one win and one loss

814
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:47,680
No two wins in a row.
-That's right

815
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,950
Next up

816
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:52,750
Simple and straightforward from the outside

817
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:57,090
The other party of a meeting is young master poverty

818
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:57,490
※A manga character who used to be a young master of a high class family and then fell into poverty

819
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:00,320
But if you see it all at once

820
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,530
You'lll just stare

821
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,700
So it needs to be reflected in a mirror

822
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,270
Just barely visible

823
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:07,800
Maybe it's better this way

824
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:10,340
"Huh? Is that real?"

825
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,000
Make him be unable to not do a double-take

826
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,980
This time I want him to look twice beautifully

827
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,480
With this as the goal

828
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,740
And so

829
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:26,490
Good morning, thank you very much today

830
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,170
Please sit down.
-Excuse me

831
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:31,250
I'm a choreographer.
-Please take care of me

832
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,660
It's important to be able to see it straight away

833
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:38,060
In short the first look is very important

834
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,670
Then

835
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,590
And so

836
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:42,780
It's easy to get sleepy

837
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:49,730
This and the teachers...

838
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:52,280
I don't know if I can ask

839
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,280
Won't look twice?

840
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,690
What is this?

841
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:58,350
Eh?

842
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:02,340
Can you calm down a bit?

843
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:06,190
This and the teachers...

844
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:09,240
Noted

845
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,180
Shimasa seems to laugh

846
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:15,050
But does not look twice

847
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,010
The truth is revealed

848
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,520
Sorry, thank you very much

849
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:30,150
Come on, what is this?

850
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,550
What do you think it is?

851
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,940
Gotta be Wed, right?

852
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,660
Abbreviated to "Wed"

853
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:40,890
This was to get people to do a double-take

854
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:43,060
I glanced

855
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,970
The moment I saw a naked body

856
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:49,070
I had a vague feeling it was this

857
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:49,640
Wednesday Downtown?

858
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,910
A tired feeling swept over me

859
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,120
How about over there?

860
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,410
The lounge before the meeting?

861
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:58,330
That one too?

862
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:00,780
After a while you went to see it again, right?

863
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:01,810
What the hell

864
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:04,550
I really wasn't sure about that one

865
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:07,620
The first time I was scared so I pretended not to look

866
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:10,220
We occasionally star in "Leave it to the Son!"

867
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:16,160
So it'd be impossible to even say "there's a sign like that in the lounge"

868
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,180
I just pretended not to see, I was too scared

869
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:23,230
New York didn't get even a single one

870
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:23,230
What will happen with Diane?

871
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:28,210
The hope of continuous success falls to Diane

872
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,440
Here we go

873
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,050
This is a very popular matcha smoothie

874
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:35,710
Looks good

875
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:39,520
This screams "goigoisu"

876
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:40,780
Enough of that

877
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:41,050
Right?

878
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:43,770
The overall feeling is a bit anxious

879
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:44,890
This happens a lot

880
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:49,120
The trap for Tsuda in the fake food outing is

881
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,120
Why is this product popular?

882
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:52,970
The trick is two-fold

883
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:56,740
In the cafe

884
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,960
There will be a weird sumo wrestler and his entourage

885
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,240
Although the followers are fat

886
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:05,380
The actual sumo himself is very thin

887
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:08,850
An extremely thin guy will walk in

888
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:10,620
I think he'll look

889
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:14,620
The first time has proven that he will not be able to resist looking twice

890
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,990
This time will be successful

891
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:19,430
First he'll look, and then...

892
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,920
I hope it'll be on this level

893
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:28,940
Will Tsuda be able to resist looking twice?

894
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,080
Actually

895
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,070
Please come in

896
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,300
Welcome

897
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:46,220
Ah, he looked

898
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:49,440
It's much better than the first

899
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,490
Welcome, please feel free to sit down.

900
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:57,790
Tsuda can't help looking twice in a row

901
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:03,940
And so the truth is revealed here

902
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,180
Ah! It hurts!

903
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:07,450
I caught my finger

904
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,450
What are you doing?
-What are you doing?

905
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:11,440
Thank you. Thank you.
-What?

906
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:09,540
So redundant!

907
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,650
I knew it was too weird

908
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:15,500
What is this?

909
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,630
Why did you pinch your finger? What?

910
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:21,490
But you achieved the achievement

911
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:23,920
Achieved?
Yes

912
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,430
This is the "make your partner do a double-take" championship

913
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:33,560
Did you notice that you couldn't help but look twice? Was it conscious?

914
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,630
No memory at all

915
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:35,870
Unconscious?
-Yes

916
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:37,840
Super thin...

917
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:42,570
I just couldn't work out this weird occurrence

918
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:45,270
Shouldn't it have been a bit more topical?

919
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:52,410
And so, the winners are Diane

920
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:53,850
I see

921
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:55,580
There we go

922
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:57,410
Tetsuo was carried away by the prayer beads

923
00:44:57,410 --> 00:44:59,880
Afraid of the beads

924
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,050
What's wrong with that? When you see large prayer beads, you stop talking

925
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:05,790
It is really unsettling

926
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:08,920
As I was talking a lot about fireworks

927
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,560
I suddenly thought "oh, is there fireworks on it?"

928
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:14,300
What?

929
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:16,530
So it was scary

930
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:19,030
It could suddenly explode.
-Indeed

931
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:20,970
What would I do if it suddenly blew up?

932
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:22,200
How is that possible?

933
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,740
You think too much

934
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,090
Cookie's ones

935
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:29,210
Casting errors...

936
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:36,750
That Makkun was not recognized is the biggest mistake

937
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:39,810
Originally, I invited Ishizaka Koji

938
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:41,450
It's impossible for him to do that

939
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:42,790
Who would do it?

940
00:45:42,790 --> 00:46:24,760
