00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,850
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,100
Thank you

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,050
OK

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:07,790
Lets get on with it

5
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,400
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,320
It's Ooki

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,510
Thanks for having me

8
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,410
Good eveni-mi

9
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:22,840
Ah, good eveni-mi

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,040
It's been a long time since I've heard it said

11
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,670
It's been a long time since anyone has said it to me

12
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,480
It's been a long time!

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,820
It's been a long time

14
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,010
I proposed a theory 7 years ago

15
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,020
Does anyone else remember?

16
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,520
Ah, I remember

17
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,020
I remember it too

18
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,680
There has been some similar to it

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,710
Yes, there has

20
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,780
Finding out whether certain people are still alive

21
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,920
Yes, you remember

22
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,860
What was it?

23
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,690
There are people that saw the living Tokugawa Keiki that are still alive

24
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,530
It turned out to be true

25
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,850
Indeed, it was quite interesting

26
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,580
So, theories related to people who have seen things like this

27
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,350
This time, i've brought another

28
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,650
This is it

29
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:06,450
There are people that saw the real Hachiko that are still alive

30
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,780
Ah, that's awesome!

31
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:09,950
Really?

32
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,280
It's Hachiko!

33
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,430
How long ago was it?

34
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,550
Hachiko died in 1935

35
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,590
Showa year 10

36
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,700
About 87 years ago

37
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,730
It was the Showa era?

38
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,630
As they'd have to be about 4 or 5 years-old to remember

39
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:30,250
The people likely to have seen Hachiko would have to be 90 and upwards

40
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,420
It's still very possible
-Indeed

41
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,110
I see
-That's it

42
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,730
What do you think, Shigemori? Do you know anything about Hachiko?

43
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,950
It's the dog that Takamori Saigo had, right?

44
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,170
No, it's not
-Is that wrong?

45
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,020
Completely incorrect
-Really?

46
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,180
That dog was called "Tsun"

47
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,190
I don't know then

48
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,760
I'm really sorry. Please don't ask me anything else today

49
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,660
Shibuya's Hachiko, you really don't know it?

50
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,890
Ah, I've seen the statue of Hachiko in Shibuya many times

51
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,960
That's a statue
-Yes, yes

52
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,730
It's based on a real dog

53
00:01:58,810 --> 00:01:59,430
Really?

54
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:22,460
There are people that saw the real Hachiko that are still alive

55
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:28,020
Hachiko appeared at Shibuya Station in the early Showa period

56
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,990
At that time, Shibuya was served by the Yamanote Line and above-ground trains

57
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,140
Tokyo Metropolitan Electricity Tamagawa Train Interchange

58
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,090
And had various stores around the station

59
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,770
That's impressive

60
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,150
It has existed from the early Showa period when Hachiko was alive until now

61
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:51,490
There is even a store in front of the Shibuya Yagyu exit that is still there

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,540
Shibuya Nishimura Fruit Bar

63
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,040
Oh that is there

64
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,000
We're looking for someone who has seen Hachiko in person

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,260
This store was opened in January of Showa 10

66
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,300
Hachiko died in the spring of the same year

67
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,470
It was established basically in the last few months of Hachiko's life

68
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,310
Our store does have some connection to Hachiko though

69
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,980
My grandmother said, "I fed Hachiko"

70
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,720
My father said, "I remember it was a very big dog, it walked slowly along the road."

71
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,290
I've heard them say this

72
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,480
Although the bronze statue in the shape of a small dog

73
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,800
Hachiko was actually an Akita, a large breed of dog

74
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,460
It's not completely accurate

75
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,660
At that time in the alley where Central Avenue is currently,

76
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,100
There were many yakitori stores opening one after another

77
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,520
When Hachiko approached

78
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,770
Drunken guests would feed it with leftover chicken

79
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,840
I've heard them talk about it

80
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:51,450
Unfortunately, both of these people have since passed away

81
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:57,920
Is there anyone from this area in that period still alive?
-I'm not sure

82
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,730
If they were alive, they would be 95 years old or older now

83
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,160
At that time, the Chamber of Commerce was in the shopping street

84
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,400
But I don't think it's easy to go access to now

85
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,200
Next up

86
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,350
Operating in Shibuya since the Taisho era,

87
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,840
Fresh Fish Shop: Fish Power

88
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:27,250
Yes, I've heard about Hachiko from my grandmother who has passed away

89
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:32,660
My grandmother once said, "I saw Hachiko with my own eyes."

90
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,190
She said on the night we watched the movie about it

91
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,660
It was so memorable

92
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,420
That movie was

93
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:47,670
"The Story of Hachiko" which was released in 1987

94
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:55,040
After watching the film, he was moved by his grandmother who told of seeing the living Hachiko with her own eyes

95
00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:00,180
He said, "Hachiko was great, he came here every day, what a great dog."

96
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,850
There were yakitori shops around the station

97
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,290
He went there everyday

98
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:10,490
People eating there would feed him with bits of it

99
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,760
After the last train, the stores closed

100
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,150
Then Hachiko went home

101
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:20,740
I heard that every day he did the same thing

102
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,990
Stop talking about it

103
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,560
Now that I think about it

104
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,010
I'm not sure if it's true or not

105
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,010
Definitely fake

106
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,030
So, Hachiko's main purpose

107
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,850
Was it to wait for the master, or for scraps of chicken?

108
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,850
It's for the master!

109
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,750
Wait a minute. Wait a minute

110
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,380
Just think of it as waiting for the master

111
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,460
Even the owner of the old store that has been opened until today

112
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,200
Doesn't know if any of the people who saw Hachiko in person are still alive

113
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:51,070
Next, we asked nursing homes and day care facilities around Shibuya

114
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:55,000
I remember a few years ago there seemed to be some

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,540
But now it seems there aren't any left

116
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,750
People who saw the dog must be 90 years old or older

117
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,660
We asked about 20 people here

118
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,420
No of them saw Hachiko in person

119
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,070
It seems it's not that easy to find

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,930
However, after talking to elderly people living in Shibuya...

121
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:26,610
How Shibuya used to be is surprising

122
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:33,200
This is what this elderly woman, who has lived in Shibuya Kamiyama-cho since she was 3 years old, had to say

123
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,550
My home was completely burned down during the war

124
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:40,550
Small houses were built on the ruins

125
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,880
The market in front of the station was very impressive

126
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:50,190
Shibuya burned to the ground when Tokyo was bombed

127
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:57,070
After the war, crowds gathered in front of Shibuya Station due to the expanding market

128
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:02,210
Now the Central Street side, the General Store Street side...

129
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,480
There are many small shops

130
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,750
Suspicious items were sold in bulk over there

131
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,750
Suspicious items

132
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,670
Six years after the end of the war

133
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:16,420
With the gradual revival of Shibuya, something appeared

134
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:22,600
An amusement park opened on the roof of the East Hall in Toyoko

135
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,360
A small cable car was built at the time of the opening of the West Pavilion

136
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,770
Cable car?
-Yes

137
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,770
Cable car?

138
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,120
A cable car connecting the two East and Cross Halls

139
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,850
A photo at the time shows it

140
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:43,320
The two sections separated by the station

141
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,620
Had a cable car connecting the rooftop amusement park as an amusement facility

142
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,570
It started operating in 1951, but only for a year and a half

143
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,000
In addition, there was...

144
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,240
What did you do for a living?

145
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,030
I'm a Geisha, I'm still in the business

146
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,460
Even now

147
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:10,740
Koito, who started as a Geisha at the age of 20 in the streets of Shibuya, is now 93 years old

148
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,340
Was there Geisha in Shibuya?

149
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,280
There used to be about 100

150
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,410
But now there are only four
-4?

151
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:21,610
Four

152
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,610
From the Taisho to Showa era

153
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:29,620
Maruyama-cho in Shibuya had many Geisha

154
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:36,530
At its peak, there were more than 100 Geisha

155
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:40,300
Later the stores were closed

156
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,970
And then they became love hotels

157
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,480
But the stores didn't directly change into love hotels

158
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,550
All along the Yamanote Line is the Hanayagi Street

159
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,820
Were there hundreds of people everywhere?
-Yes, yes

160
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,960
There was one near every station, like Shinjuku

161
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,160
But now it is in decline

162
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,660
There is only one left

163
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,670
Is it here in Shibuya?
-Yes

164
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:14,830
Although we gained a lot of interesting information related to Shibuya

165
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:18,670
We had still not found anyone who had seen Hachiko

166
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,700
Pretty difficult

167
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:25,510
Next, we located a researcher at the Shibuya City Museum of Localities, which is the most knowledgable of Hachiko

168
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:29,460
We enquired with Matsui

169
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,220
Hachiko was born in November of the 12th year of the Taisho era.

170
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:43,200
The following year, in January of Taisho 13, he was brought to Shibuya for breeding

171
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,270
The owner was from Tokyo Imperial University

172
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,040
Professor Eizaburo Ueno

173
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:55,040
But Professor Ueno died just one year later

174
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,350
After the death of Dr. Ueno

175
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:00,550
The story is, Hachiko went to Shibuya every day

176
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:06,690
Published in a Showa 7 newspaper

177
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:12,460
"The big dog in front of Shibuya Station waiting for its deceased owner."

178
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,730
Everyone knew this story

179
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:20,270
"What a faithful dog", everyone thought

180
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:27,330
After 7 years of continuous waiting for the owner, Hachiko had received coverage

181
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:32,680
And became a popular star at Shibuya Station in one fell swoop

182
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,420
The day after the story was published

183
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:42,560
In order to touch the head of Hachiko, schoolchildren formed a long line

184
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,620
His popularity was high

185
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,500
In front of the station, "Hachiko rice" and "Hachiko pancakes" appeared

186
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,410
There was a wide range of goods named after Hachiko

187
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,660
Until the death of Hachiko in Showa 10

188
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:04,220
Shibuya Station "Hachiko Fever" lasted for three years

189
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,750
An especially surprising pice of information pertains to the bronze statue of Hachiko

190
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,890
When was the bronze statue built?

191
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,490
A year before the death of Hachiko

192
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:17,770
It was completed before the death of Hachiko?
-Yes

193
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,650
Before passing away

194
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:24,760
Yes, newspapers state that Hachiko himself was at the unveiling of the statue

195
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,600
Attended in person

196
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,030
An accomplishment most people, except dictators, are unlikely to experience

197
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,700
A celebration of his life while he was still alive

198
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,860
This statement is too...

199
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:38,220
We are searching for surviving people who have seen Hachiko in person

200
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,220
Are there any still alive in 2022?

201
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,820
I think there is

202
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,360
But it'll be tough to find

203
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:53,660
I personally know the son of the veterinarian who treated Hachiko

204
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,630
I asked him a lot of questions about Hachiko

205
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,770
But he passed away in December of last year

206
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,340
From our museum's perspective, we would very much like to find someone who is still alive

207
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:06,140
I'd like to ask them about Hachiko, but it's getting harder and harder

208
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:13,000
Even after becoming world-famous, Hachiko still came to Shibuya Station almost every day for 3 years

209
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,790
So there must have been many witnesses

210
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,460
Thus, we continued our investigation for three weeks

211
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,790
And finally got some valuable information

212
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:45,500
The words "It is possible that I saw Hachiko with my own eyes"

213
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,450
We travelled to Narita City in Chiba Prefecture to meet an elderly person

214
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,890
Where did you live in Shibuya at that time?

215
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,560
About 2-3 minutes walk from the station

216
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:03,430
In front of my house was the head office of Tokyu

217
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,240
There was a long row of wooden buildings

218
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,460
We're looking for someone who saw Hachiko in person

219
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,880
Yes, I saw him

220
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,910
He was very large

221
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,960
Success!

222
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,450
Finally, a person who saw Hachiko has been found

223
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,090
Said so readily

224
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,260
When I was about 4 years old

225
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:36,500
In front of my house, my father said, "Hachiko is coming"

226
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,600
Looking out from inside the store, he passed by in a whoosh

227
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,970
I just saw him like this

228
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,900
Makino, whose home was a hardware store

229
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:51,180
Saw Hachiko walk past the store, though only for a moment

230
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,890
He really did go there every day

231
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,950
I heard that Hachiko was always around the station

232
00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:00,190
At that time, there was so many food stalls in front of the station

233
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,330
She's definitely gonna tell this story again

234
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:08,530
People drinking there would throw chicken or bones or something to him

235
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,580
Can we stop talking about yakitori?

236
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:12,180
I've heard Hachiko ate this sort of stuff a lot

237
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,560
It seems that this is indeed true

238
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,170
And another...

239
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:19,680
I saw Hachiko crossing the street at the Yamanote Line

240
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,140
While looking out of the train

241
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,500
Saw Hachiko outside?

242
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:29,820
Kuroi, from a train, saw Hachiko crossing the street

243
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,220
Eyewitnesses are suddenly appearing

244
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:35,730
First he looked left, and then looked right, and then crossed the road

245
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,730
What a great laugh!

246
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,490
I saw this

247
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:44,160
And this lady who used to visit Shibuya Station at that time

248
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,800
I was born in Showa 3

249
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,500
Hachiko died in Showa 10, right?

250
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,500
Yes

251
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,350
I can still remember things very clearly from when I was 7 years old

252
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,710
It was at the ticket gate

253
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:03,070
He was hanging around

254
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:08,190
Just kept turning around

255
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:13,100
Was it common for Hachiko to be at Shibuya Station at that time?

256
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,200
Yes, lots of people went over to pat him on the head

257
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,040
He was a very calm dog

258
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,640
Pale yellow

259
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,440
How can I put it? He wasn't that good-looking

260
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,240
And...

261
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,750
Ah, professor!

262
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,910
This Shibuya-born inventor

263
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,750
What?

264
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,080
Have you ever seen Hachiko with your own eyes?
-Yes

265
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,920
I am now considered to be a long-term experienced individual

266
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,920
Seriously!?

267
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,260
I created this "Long Experience Platform"

268
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:48,100
The most important is that the narrator of history

269
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,000
I've witnessed a lot of events over the years

270
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,200
※A failed mutiny that occurred in Japan on February 26, 1936, in which some young officers of the Imperial Army led more than 1,000 soldiers to assassinate the "unificationists" and opponents of the government and senior members of the military, and the coup was eventually crushed.

271
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,210
For example, the February 26th Incident

272
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:59,880
Machine gun teams lined up on the street in what is now Harajuku

273
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,110
Although we are also interested in the February 26th Incident

274
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,380
We would most like to ask about Hachiko
-Yes, Hachiko

275
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,280
Lying there, sleeping

276
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,990
Baaaaa, lying there as if asleep

277
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:15,760
No "barking" at all

278
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,490
No response

279
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:24,730
Just waiting there for his master patiently, same as is known

280
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:31,470
Also, there is Daigo, who likes dogs

281
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:35,710
I'd like to ask you about Hachiko
-Hachiko, a very loyal dog, right?

282
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:39,250
Have you seen him with your own eyes?
-Well, when I was in kindergarten,

283
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,550
I lived in Osaki at the time.

284
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:45,150
I used to get the Yamanote Line at Shibuya

285
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:49,090
At the ticket gate outside, Hachiko was there

286
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:53,400
I used to go and pat him on the head

287
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,400
You patted him?
-Yes, I did

288
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,280
Touched Hachiko!

289
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:01,270
I was in kindergarten so him and me had the same eye-level

290
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:06,720
Not only seeing him, we also found people who have touched Hachiko with their own hands

291
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,720
Awesome!

292
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:13,020
Not only that, but we also found genuine footage of Hachiko

293
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,250
Please watch this rare footage

294
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,790
Faithful Dog Hachiko

295
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,690
Yakitori!

296
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:25,820
Is that him?

297
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,820
He's huge!

298
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,630
You also came to see the dog that moves people?

299
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,960
Why are you touching the dog? Come here

300
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,440
Why should only teachers should come here?

301
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,480
This is the real Hachiko

302
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,210
And a little off-topic

303
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:46,820
When I was walking near Sakuranagi on a quiet road

304
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,490
Across the street came a man of my age now

305
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:55,830
He said, "My mother fed Hachiko," and I was shocked to hear that

306
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,400
The left ear was folded

307
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,400
It's true

308
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,020
And "my mother sewed it"

309
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:06,440
The tip of the ear was broken when he returned from a fight outside

310
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,840
She did the stitching, but because it was done by an amateur,

311
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,410
After the injury it wasn't restored to its original state, it remained in this folded state

312
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,040
This is what I heard

313
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,510
You just came across this person?

314
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,080
Yes, I was surprised to come across this information completely by chance

315
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:24,550
To sum up
There are plenty of people still alive that saw Hachiko

316
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:27,220
Impressive

317
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,750
There's still some people that saw him

318
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,420
Quite a lot this time

319
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,590
Wasn't he in a movie?

320
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:37,090
He acted in Showa 9
-Indeed in a movie

321
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,100
"It Started in the Alps released in Showa 9

322
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,440
But he was really big
-Really big!

323
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,100
Very impressive

324
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,020
But there were many derogatory statements

325
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,070
About Hachiko...

326
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:51,080
Not loyal to his master but just wants to eat chicken, right?

327
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,080
I guess so

328
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,880
And that one...

329
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,220
Bronze statue built before death 'like a dictator"

330
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,150
It's better not to say this sort of thing

331
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,790
"Surprisingly dirty"
-Yeah, yeah, yeah

332
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,090
We don't need this kind of information

333
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,930
The old man sitting on his doorstep at the end

334
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:10,430
Was he waiting for his mother to get back?

335
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:13,680
He's not the kind of grandpa who waits for people on the side of the road

336
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,300
Let's welcome the next presenter

337
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:27,070
It's FUJIWARA!

338
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,370
Thank you
-Thank you

339
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:36,290
Previously, there was a project that had junior comedians performing

340
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:41,500
And FUJIWARA's Haranishi made it very awkward for them by saying "I have a similar joke, are you copying me"?

341
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,630
We had a project like this.
-Do you remember?

342
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:49,930
Haranishi was shown a segment by a junior comedian and improvised a similar segment

343
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:53,210
Then, he made it difficult for them by attempting to prevent them from performing it

344
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:57,740
As a result, basically all of the junior comedians' sketches were successfully suppressed

345
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,940
Originally, it was just a joke

346
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,750
Indeed, but after I met one of the juniors

347
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,680
He said he never performed the joke after that

348
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,690
I don't know but i'm still feeling weird about it
-It obviously wouldn't be performed again

349
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:12,620
So this time, we've come up with another diabolical theory

350
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:19,830
It's hard to overcome a senpai who insists on playing the same character as you and says "I did it before you"

351
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,240
Certainly difficult

352
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:31,480
And so, the first test subject invited to a fake shoot was

353
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,980
Thank you for having me

354
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,780
With three years of experience: Yasuko

355
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,380
Yasuko

356
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,680
I was a self-defense officer

357
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:43,720
Last year, she became popular with her Self Defense Force persona

358
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:47,260
The one who is going to make things difficult for her this time is

359
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,930
Thank you for having me

360
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,920
With 20 years of experience: Texas

361
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,770
So experienced!

362
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:54,170
Self-defense force after all
-Looks the part

363
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:57,230
Like Yasuko, he was also a former member of the Land Self-Defense Force

364
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,680
A pioneer of self-defense comedy

365
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,810
Looks very convincing

366
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,580
Next

367
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,140
Documentary skit

368
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,510
Wow, I forgot the lines. What was it?

369
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,740
We let Yasuko, who is yet to shoot,

370
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:17,810
And Texas, who just finished filming, meet in the lounge

371
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,190
Wow
-Good morning

372
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,360
Good morning

373
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,300
Texas?
-Yeah, it's me

374
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,430
Wow!
Thank you, Yasu

375
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,060
Thanks for your hard work
-Thank you for your hard work

376
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,270
I'm sorry
-No

377
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,830
We're meeting for the first time, right?
-Wow, wow

378
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,340
First time meeting, excuse me, excuse me

379
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,610
I'm really, really sorry. I'm really sorry

380
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:36,370
I've always wanted to meet you

381
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,170
No, no, I don't dare

382
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,910
I always follow you on TV

383
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:40,910
No need to be so polite. Sit down, sit down

384
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:45,720
Oops, no

385
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:52,720
Yasuko is very frightened to meet her senpai for the first time

386
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,590
Yasuko is usually like this

387
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,400
Must be scary

388
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,590
How many years have you been doing this?

389
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,090
Just two years so far

390
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:00,000
1 term?
-Yes

391
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,590
The conversation between the two naturally comes to the Self Defense Force

392
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,470
What rifles did you use?

393
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,510
Type 89 Rifle
-89 ah

394
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,810
Did you use 64?
-Yes

395
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:11,840
Wow!

396
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,340
What are you talking about?

397
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,480
What are you talking about?
-I don't understand

398
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:16,980
Have you ever thrown a hand grenade?

399
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,480
I have

400
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,120
You can't throw it without an order?
-Yes

401
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:24,490
That must be tough
-Yes it is

402
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:29,840
First, we let the two happily talk about the self-defense force

403
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:36,030
And then, the difficult challenge begins

404
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:39,970
I don't mean anything by this but

405
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:45,640
Our two personas are really pretty similar, aren't they

406
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,080
Starting with clothing

407
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:54,320
Oh I don't mean anything weird by it
-Yes

408
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:58,170
As an unexpected attack is unleashed

409
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:01,190
Yasu can't help but suddenly sit up straight

410
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,160
And then

411
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:08,570
After all, it was me who started using the Self Defense Force persona first!

412
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,320
Here we go

413
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,700
There is indeed a bit of similarity... regarding this

414
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,970
By the way

415
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:19,980
Can you stop using the Self Defense Force persona in the future?

416
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,610
Self-defense force persona...waaaa

417
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,250
What do you think?

418
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:32,390
Waaaaaa... how...

419
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,630
I'll stop being a self-defense comedian

420
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,690
Yasuko chooses to give up the self-defense force persona after a painful internal struggle

421
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,020
Really?

422
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,910
Can you really?

423
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,180
The orders of commanding officers must be absolutely obeyed

424
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,550
If you want to wear camouflage, then I won't wear it anymore

425
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,330
You are not in the service now

426
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:57,210
Really, sir, your orders are absolutely correct

427
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:03,620
Then I'll...waa waaa ehhhhh ummm

428
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:09,100
Yasuko painfully decides to give up her persona to the other side

429
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,100
What a face

430
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,430
In future we can still coexist in separate domains

431
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,100
Thank you for giving me this opportunity

432
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,160
No, no, I'm the one who should be thanking you

433
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,800
OK, "yes, sir!"

434
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,180
What's going on?

435
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:22,400
Out of respect for her superior, she decides to relinquish elements of the Self Defense Force

436
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,680
Do you have a favorite camouflage style?

437
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,950
I like the blue camouflage of the Maritime Self-Defense Force

438
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,580
So you can wear blue camouflage?

439
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,080
Fiiiine

440
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:36,800
Regarding the five different kinds of crawling

441
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,930
The first four are one's that i'll use from now on

442
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:42,790
No problem at all

443
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:46,060
Waaaaa! I don't know

444
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,100
Eh? Is it okay or not?

445
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:48,730
No problem

446
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:49,830
It's okay?
-Yes

447
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:57,760
After that, all kinds of unequal treaties were decided upon, from the one-shot technique to the way of speaking

448
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:03,050
Yasuko literally always dresses like this

449
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,850
What is this?

450
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:10,890
What are you going to do if you don't work as a SDF comedian anymore?

451
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,660
I'm SONY, so I'll go naked

452
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,930
Cover here with a pan

453
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,600
Isn't that also plagiarism?

454
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,330
Ah, is it plagiarism? Wow, I'm sorry

455
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:24,170
I... i'll wear a loin cloth, loin cloth...

456
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:26,900
And swallow fire

457
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,110
What the hell?

458
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:30,910
The next target is

459
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,580
Excuse me. Good morning

460
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,850
I'm Elf Arakawa, thanks for having me

461
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:38,900
With six years of experience: Elf Arakawa

462
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,060
Happiness~

463
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:47,080
She is now gaining popularity as a gyaru comedian

464
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:49,460
The one who will make things difficult for her is...

465
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,420
Is this joke bad?

466
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:59,540
A gyaru comedian with 11 years of experience: U-BEAM☆

467
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,530
These two are also meeting for the first time

468
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:07,040
And so the challenge begins

469
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,810
How can I put it?

470
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:16,250
Some seniors often tell me that our two personas collide

471
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,620
Seniors said that?
-Yes

472
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,760
It's a clash, right?

473
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:24,360
In terms of the gyaru persona then I guess there is a bit of a clash

474
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:29,200
I also often feel, like, "aren't I the one that started it?"

475
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:33,140
Have you ever considered giving up being a gyaru comedian?

476
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,010
This...no longer a gyaru comedian?

477
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,880
Are you being serious about this right now?

478
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,560
It's serious!

479
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,420
Yeah

480
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:50,950
I think... the entertainment business is a place where losing is tantamount to dying

481
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,790
But I just want to do the same thing as U-BEAM by chance

482
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:58,630
So if personas are colliding, perhaps this could just be seen as a healthy competitive relationship

483
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:02,130
Like, I don't want to lose to you but I don't mean any offense by that

484
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,700
Hmm...

485
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:09,970
I'm sorry if you see it that way, but I can't give up

486
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,400
Very bold
-Arakawa, right?

487
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:16,850
Faced with the unreasonable difficulty of trying to monopolize the gyaru persona that is not exclusive to anyone

488
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:22,350
Arakawa decisively refuses the request with careful expressions

489
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,600
Thus, U-BEAM ☆, the senpai, counters

490
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,530
Do you have any signature joke?

491
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:34,030
First of all, I usually open by saying "Yay!", right?

492
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:39,070
When I see your "Yay!" I have the feeling of "Wow, so similar"

493
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:42,110
Isn't that how you lot all say hello?
-Yes

494
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:46,980
The topic shifts to accusations of joke stealing

495
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:51,450
I might also say "Happiness" and "Hashtag"

496
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,820
I also do, how should I put it...

497
00:27:54,650 --> 00:28:00,390
To make things difficult for the other party, U-BEAM ☆ starts to improvise and create a joke that clashes with the other's

498
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,840
And so

499
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:06,700
"From Happiness to Loneliness, Bring the Chef out!"

500
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,630
I have a joke like this
-No way!

501
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:09,720
And,

502
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:12,700
Also "Storm Crying Wailing"

503
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,710
I have "Wailing in Moderation"
-Really?

504
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,140
The quality of jokes is significantly lower than the other's

505
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,110
It's improvised after all

506
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:24,210
What about "pretending to apologize but actually showing off Chanel"?

507
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:28,090
"Thank you-Chanel!"

508
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,950
No way...

509
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,850
U-BEAM☆ holds on tightly

510
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:38,060
And so, Arakawa, who had been very strong before...

511
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,730
I'm really sorry about this

512
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:43,930
I feel like we both can't get away with "Chanel"

513
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:47,470
I won't touch "Chanel"
-Really?

514
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,740
Yes

515
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:51,910
"The best good, GUCCI" is okay?

516
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:55,080
This seems more interesting

517
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,320
What the hell is interesting?

518
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:00,580
Chanel becomes exclusive as the other is allowed to change to Gucci

519
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,990
What are you talking about?

520
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:04,830
And so, the truth is revealed

521
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,830
I'm afraid, I'm afraid

522
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,560
This is Wednesday Downtown

523
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,330
No way!

524
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:17,000
The whole time I kept thinking "please let this be a prank!"

525
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,100
U-BEAM☆ that was really messed up

526
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,840
You must've thought I'm awful

527
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,540
It sucked, seriously, what a shitty person!

528
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,210
No question!

529
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,830
I'd definitely think that

530
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:29,380
And so, the last target is...

531
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:32,620
Hello, I'm JP, a parody comedian, thank you for having me

532
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,500
With sixteen years of experience: JP

533
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:43,730
Appearing on Wide na Show as Matsumoto recently helped boost his popularity significantly

534
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,850
He is ranked top amongst all Matsumoto Hitoshi impersonators

535
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,530
The one who has come to make things difficult for him is...

536
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,070
Thank you for having me

537
00:29:55,970 --> 00:30:01,680
With 30 years of imitation experience as Downstutowntsu's Matsumoto Hitoshi

538
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,810
Not at all alike

539
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,150
Do you have confidence?

540
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:07,550
Not really, but I I I I will work hard will work hard

541
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:15,060
It's true that... yes, people with a long history... are long... yes

542
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,930
His speech is so wasteful

543
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:24,560
These two met once ten years ago

544
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,500
How did it go?

545
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,110
Good Morning
-Good morning

546
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,970
What's going on?

547
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,340
It's been a long time, please let me know your contact information

548
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:34,680
I'm not being rude, am I?

549
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,580
I don't even know how to get anything up on my phone
-Really?

550
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:41,790
Yes, basically, I let my wife or Hamada do it when he's around

551
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,790
Who?

552
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,490
His partner, right?

553
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:44,350
Downstutowntsu's

554
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:49,590
The two reunited Matsumotos have a nice chat

555
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:52,100
Can you show me Matsumoto's laugh?

556
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,160
Ah a laugh

557
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,130
Really similar

558
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,500
The pose is also similar

559
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:59,470
I'll mimic the laugh too

560
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:04,520
The quality...
-Terrible

561
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:11,110
A low-quality Matsumoto

562
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:13,960
Begins using his seniority to be unkind

563
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,900
Will it work?

564
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,390
Go ahead
-How should I put it? The imitation of Matsumoto

565
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:32,470
If I tell JP directly, if it's okay, don't do the imitation

566
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,510
Saying it in person, what will happen?

567
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,310
Ah... eh... what do you mean?

568
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,440
Do you want me to talk to Matsumoto?

569
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,380
No, no, it's me telling you

570
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:46,820
If its okay to stop doing it, like this...

571
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,090
What if I told him in person?

572
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,550
What do you mean?

573
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:53,690
What's he talking about?

574
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,460
Uh... what are we talking about? I'm sorry

575
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,730
I forgot what we were talking about

576
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:03,890
It's a long, complicated sentence like a Kamaitachi skit

577
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:09,010
Matsumoto Hitoshi isn't getting his point across at all

578
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:10,970
His conversation skills...

579
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,080
To put it bluntly, can you not...
-Please tell me, tell me

580
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:13,610
What?

581
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,720
Can you stop imitating Matsumoto?

582
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,350
Should have just said that to begin
-Yeah

583
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,820
Don't do it... eh, now?
-Yes

584
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,420
I value the viewers' opinions

585
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:31,930
If people like to see it, then I want to keep doing it

586
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,230
Reluctant to give up?
-Reluctant to give up

587
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:40,230
JP politely expresses that he will continue to imitate Matsumoto

588
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:43,240
Matsumoto continues to express himself

589
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,740
JP, i'm just telling you here

590
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:49,450
I have Matsumoto's contact info
-Is that so?

591
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:57,420
I personally feel that Matsumoto actually acknowledges me more

592
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:00,820
That's for sure. I don't think there's anything wrong with that

593
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,150
Definitely not so

594
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:08,260
Implicitly revealing to the other party that Matsumoto is more accepting of him

595
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:10,630
How dare you say that!

596
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,870
Hamada is also very good to me

597
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,580
The actual Hamada?
-Of course

598
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:20,730
He's saying he is supported by Downtown

599
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,380
Wow

600
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:23,510
Showing off his good friendship with Hamada

601
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:29,160
And stressing the superiority of using real hair instead of a wig

602
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,360
How to say

603
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:39,060
If you can give it up then I will also be happy

604
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,000
What kind of tone is this?

605
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,500
Yes, I understand

606
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:46,940
To be honest, I do it because I really like Matsumoto

607
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:45,060
Also note the Kansai accent

608
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:53,980
The fact that I am able to do this today, my own efforts don't even account for 0.1%

609
00:33:53,980 --> 00:34:00,380
Its all thanks to the help and support of Matsumoto

610
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,350
It's all really due to Matsumoto

611
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:06,020
If that...

612
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:11,730
If possible

613
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,270
Sorry, I'm getting a little carried away

614
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:21,070
I feel a lot of emotions inside, sorry

615
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,210
Let me think about it

616
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,680
I'm really sorry

617
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:27,650
What a face that was

618
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,510
Please let me continue...

619
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:29,650
What an expression

620
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:29,850
Excuse me

621
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,250
You're not the real person you know

622
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:36,920
I sincerely ask you to let me continue to imitate Matsumoto in the future

623
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:41,390
Facing JP's plea with tears in his eyes

624
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,360
Please let me imitate Matsumoto, please!

625
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,360
Ok

626
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:53,200
Inexplicably, one impersonator allows another impersonator's impersonation

627
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,410
Who the hell are you?

628
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:57,240
The main purpose seems to have changed

629
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,580
Here the truth is revealed

630
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:01,840
Who are you?
-He's Hitoshi!

631
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:02,780
Why do you get to make the decision

632
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,780
Why does he decide on my behalf?

633
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:07,280
That... no... that...

634
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,050
Sorry, I have to put the wig on

635
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:16,240
JP thought it was the fake segment for an online show

636
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,120
But we informed him it was actually Wednesday Downtown

637
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:26,340
Seriously!?

638
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,340
No way!

639
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,690
Great!

640
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,410
Thank god!

641
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:37,150
I thought...

642
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:42,290
I'm so happy
-I was having a tough time too

643
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:54,100
I really thought I couldn't do it

644
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,110
Impressive

645
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,270
I'm sorry. I'm sorry

646
00:35:56,270 --> 00:36:00,170
I've made it this far...

647
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:04,110
I thought I was going to lose everything

648
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:09,680
To sum up
Losing one's persona can be so painful that one cries out in pain

649
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,090
Impressive

650
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:15,190
An impressive VTR
-How was it?

651
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:17,220
I didn't expect Matsumoto to cry at the end

652
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,330
I also didn't expect to see such a thing unfold

653
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:22,770
How do you feel about JP?

654
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:27,100
His love and respect for you overflowed on the screen

655
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:31,030
He is a good guy, so I guess its too be expected of him

656
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:34,080
Compared to him, Hitoshi is really...
-It's true

657
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,540
Looking at him pisses me off

658
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,490
He's become more and more unlike you in recent years

659
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:41,710
A number of unexplained phenomena have occurred

660
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:45,420
I'd like to see the real Matsumoto giving Hitoshi a hard time

661
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,300
If you gave me the chance I wouldn't stop!

662
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,190
Saying anything is incredibly fair

663
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:59,530
Next is everybody's theories

664
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:02,000
Tonight's presenters are

665
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,030
Onigoe Tomahawk
-Thanks for having us

666
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:10,040
Anti-social, anti-social people
-No no no

667
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:17,220
Without further ado, this time we bring you a hypothesis related to one of Yoshimoto Kogyo's senior members

668
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,520
Please have a look

669
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:23,020
There are no young comedians who know the real name of Honkon

670
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,360
Probably not

671
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:33,260
He was using his  real name until the end of "Gottsu ee Kanji"

672
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:36,300
Then changed it to his stage name

673
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,070
Changed to Honkon?
-Yes

674
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,470
How long has it been since he changed to Honkon

675
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,480
25 years

676
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,820
By the way, Iizuka, do you Honkon's real name?

677
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:48,340
Well, I watched Gottsu Ee Kanji

678
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:51,460
It's Kurano, right?

679
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:54,980
Yes, his first name is Kurano

680
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,300
Matsumoto certainly knows, right?

681
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:02,430
No, my memory is a little hazy

682
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,900
Takahiro

683
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:11,400
We're not really sure

684
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,440
What?

685
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,620
You're asking the question but you don't know?

686
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,910
I'm sorry

687
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,690
Originally the group was called Hong Kong Macau

688
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:23,420
The group disbanded, leaving only Hong Kong

689
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:26,440
For some reason people started calling him Honkon Honkon

690
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,150
So that's where he got his stage name I guess

691
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,090
Yes

692
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:36,830
There are no young comedians who know the real name of Honkon

693
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:46,500
To verify, young comedians who debuted after Honkon's name change were tested

694
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,330
First

695
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,480
Good morning

696
00:38:53,790 --> 00:39:00,020
Debuting just six years ago, The Mummy

697
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,450
Please listen to the question
-Ok

698
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:02,520
Question?

699
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,360
Who is this?

700
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,360
Hello
-Hello

701
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,430
Honkon？

702
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,030
Correct

703
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,160
Yes
-Yes

704
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,130
Have you ever worked with Honkon?

705
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:19,940
We worked with him twice in Osaka

706
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,100
What impression did you have of him

707
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:26,910
He wears glasses backstage

708
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:31,010
When reading the newspaper or something, it's kind of scary

709
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:34,180
He's a very nice guy though

710
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:35,950
Please listen to another question

711
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:41,730
What is Honkon's real name?

712
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:49,130
This is a bit...

713
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,370
Honkon's real name?

714
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:54,440
He has a pretty unique and interesting name

715
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,570
It's more of a beautiful name

716
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,810
What is it...

717
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:00,240
It's more like a handsome man's name, right?

718
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,750
Nakayauchi Mao

719
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,040
Is that a handsome man?

720
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,250
Incorrect

721
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,420
As expected, they don't know

722
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,690
Too tough

723
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:17,190
Next is Hanako Kikuta, who has experience in co-starring with a different agency

724
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:20,430
What impression do you have of him

725
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:27,700
He sometimes... makes political statements

726
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,830
This is what has happened recently

727
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:32,380
A little... a little scary

728
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,280
Is that okay? He won't be mad will he?

729
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:42,080
So, what is Honkon's real name?

730
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:47,320
Eh? Honkon's?

731
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:51,830
What was it? I should know

732
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:53,160
What is it?

733
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,900
It has "Kura" in it

734
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:00,900
Kurama Toshikazu

735
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,410
No? Who knows?

736
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:11,470
The next question is a junior comedian who belongs to the same agency as Honkon

737
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:07,960
"Kura" was right at least

738
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:19,290
And is also a regular on "Marco Pololi"

739
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:18,900
Must know then

740
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:24,480
What is Honkon's real name?

741
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,770
Kurano...

742
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:38,070
Kurano Yoichi

743
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:40,080
Wrong?

744
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:46,580
But we really...

745
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:52,290
I haven't been a regular member for six months

746
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:54,760
We're not that close, really

747
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,410
Excuse!

748
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:55,510
Is that the issue?

749
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,420
The next challenger is...

750
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:02,060
Miki should know, right?

751
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:06,870
Not only do we often meet on shows, we also perform at the Lumine Theater once a month

752
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:09,070
We're often together in the green room

753
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:13,210
Wait, what? What? So scary!

754
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,380
I'm scared of...

755
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:19,220
I don't really want to talk about Honkon

756
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,920
This is the most unacceptable

757
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,520
Still
-What's wrong?

758
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:28,190
He's been angry with me several times

759
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,590
I did indeed do something wrong

760
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:33,530
Said my greeting was too shallow
-Too shallow?

761
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:33,620
Greeting was too shallow?

762
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,400
He told me "say good morning properly!"

763
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,530
"Saying "morning" isn't good enough"

764
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:41,270
"Look down and say "good morning" properly!"

765
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:43,640
"What you're doing isn't a real greeting"

766
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:48,580
He got angry at the show's celebration party, where Higashino and all the staff were present

767
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:54,250
I also had a meal with him at Lumine once

768
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:55,890
Honkon asked, "What are you going to eat?

769
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:56,920
"Soba noodles"

770
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,750
"Oh really?" "Yes."

771
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:01,360
"Is it good?" "Yes."

772
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,290
He scolded me, saying, "don't you wanna have a conversation!?"

773
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:07,330
Don't want to

774
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:13,440
I was shouted at for not wanting to start a conversation over lunch
-I've been shouted at a few times for the same thing

775
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,400
Doesn't want to

776
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,610
"Say something!"

777
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:19,680
And he'd tell me "don't answer so boringly"

778
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:24,540
As we now know that Miki and Honkon are very close, let's get to the point

779
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:28,300
Known

780
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,120
What is Honkon's full name

781
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,290
Really?
-See!

782
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:34,890
Honestly, I might actually know

783
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:38,630
After all, you'd definitely know important senior comedians

784
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:39,630
You know?
-Yes

785
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:43,770
Seriously, I can't think of even a single character

786
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:45,740
It is similar to Honkon?

787
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:48,800
I'm not saying anything
-Can't think of a single character

788
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:51,710
Forget about the validity of this theory or anything

789
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:55,280
Not being able to answer is very rude to Honkon

790
00:43:55,650 --> 00:44:02,890
Homma... Homma Daisuke?

791
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,360
Too much

792
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:06,660
That was very rude
-This is gonna be bad

793
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,690
Can I say it?
-Please do

794
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:12,120
Kurano Takahiro

795
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:12,660
Correct

796
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:13,830
Very good

797
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:16,230
Very good

798
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:17,530
Its Kurano!

799
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:19,040
Everyone is so rude

800
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:24,770
Regarding Gottsu Ee Kanji, people always think of Downtown, Imada and Higashino

801
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:25,910
These main characters

802
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:27,240
Ah wait what i'm saying is too much....

803
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,950
I don't really understand what he's getting at

804
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:35,520
To sum up
Honkon's going to shout at everyone

805
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:39,270
I'm sorry
-This is bad

806
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:43,530
If Honkon sees this he'll be angry

807
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:44,860
He watches all shows
-Literally everything

808
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:47,170
You are the ones who brought this theory

809
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:50,130
We haven't met him yet

810
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:53,240
If possible, I hope to reach the end of my career without meeting Honkon

811
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,220
No way, you haven't met at all?
-No, not at all

812
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,860
Really?
-Not at all

813
00:44:58,860 --> 00:44:59,480
Really!?

814
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:04,550
Many young comedians have warned us over the years to be careful

815
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:09,050
We also watched Honkon when we were young

816
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:13,240
But why are Downtown's henchmen still held in such high regard?

817
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,060
Shut up!

818
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:15,120
That's scary!

819
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,560
This should absolutely never be said!

820
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:20,530
Hamada, this is the guy that said it

821
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:22,470
Even juniors wouldn't dare say such a thing!

822
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:26,780
I'm sorry, this guy is really...

823
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,750
We are currently recruiting women who really like Kuro-chan

824
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:35,240
Although the planned program is not yet confirmed

825
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:39,890
The specific plan will be determined according to the situation of the recruited people

826
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:41,960
Please go to the program website to state your interest!

827
00:45:43,050 --> 00:46:14,750
