1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
The Second Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende Chiki-Chiki

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:08,000
Yamasaki Hosei's Ass Revenge "Ass-1 Grand Prix!!"

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,760
So that's his last wish

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,360
That is so, he absolutely wants to do it

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,260
That's his wish to end this year

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,260
Well, about that

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,760
I can understand why he wants that

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,160
He would hate not doing it so much.

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,760
Wouldn't you feel the same?

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,860
He always did what he wanted to

11
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,660
Anyway he wants to do it this month and year

12
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,260
He's very encouraged. I see.

13
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,260
Without further a do

14
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,300
Let's see Yamasaki on the stage

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,900
He's on it

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,900
Yamasaki san

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,100
Good day. Come on in

18
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,100
Frankly speaking, I'm so angry today!

19
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,500
What are you angry about?

20
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,000
I must be the one to do it

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,700
You see, last time I didn't fight to the fullest

22
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,400
Didn't you?

23
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,100
Honestly, I was overpowered by Moriman

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,800
I see. Honestly, in many aspects

25
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:13,100
But last time before the match with Moriman you were saying how you'll beat everyone

26
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:22,500
Before today's match he came to me and said "she's a bit mean to me, I don't understand that", isn't that hilarious?

27
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,500
Last time Yamasaki fought with an Ass-match champion Moriman

28
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:33,100
Where Yamasaki fought with a steel will in a match where the existence and the survival were bound together

29
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,100
I'm sorry for last time

30
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,100
I'm sorry for that.

31
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,700
I'm really sorry, can grab your attention for a moment?

32
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,000
Look at this

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Who's that? That's mine

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,600
So that's you? Yes

35
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,700
I've injured my fourth and fifth ribs

36
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,100
But there's nothing at all!

37
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,500
I did! Look there!

38
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,500
But it's all white, I don't understand what you mean

39
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,600
How can you not see anything on it?

40
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,800
Wait a moment, then what do you want to say with that? You want to quit today?

41
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,800
If that's possible...

42
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,500
Then why you came?

43
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:18,900
I'd like to quit it, but I won't be fighting like last time

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,300
Last sparring was about physical condition

45
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,000
As we've seen. So what's your plan for today?

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,100
Today this sparring will not be about physical condition. This time, as I don't have much power, I'll be using a lot of technique

47
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:33,500
Is that so?

48
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:38,500
If I'll be doing that, I'll definitely beat Moriman

49
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,200
Then call your sparring partner

50
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,200
Hey, mister!

51
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,200
What a tough-looking fella

52
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,700
Hello, is that your friend?

53
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,300
Good day

54
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,000
Is that so? You must be joking

55
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,700
Heipo, are you going to fine?

56
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,400
I think I'll be alright

57
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,300
He looks quite ready

58
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,700
I'm looking forward for it

59
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,600
"Revenge" (rule-free mixed martial arts match to grab one's ass)

60
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,600
Looks good

61
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,400
He's attacking!

62
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,200
What's Heipo doing?

63
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,300
You fought like a 40 year old office worker

64
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,700
Yamasaki san, that was good

65
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,300
You did really good

66
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,100
You understood how to get an advantage over the opponent?

67
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,400
But as we've seen previously, Moriman slaps the face

68
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,100
Is that so?

69
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,100
Do some guard work

70
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,200
Let's go

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,400
"Assuming a champion's attack, sparring again"

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,700
Just like that, throw these punches, Heipo!

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,300
Yamasaki san, that's not how you do it

74
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:41,700
I would like to see a fight for the last bowl of rice between Moriman and Heipo

75
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,600
Wait there a moment!

76
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,200
Give me another chance! But that's not the matter!

77
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,800
Give me another try! Why you're asking for that?

78
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,700
I'll do my best

79
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:57,700
I understand. So this time, Yamasaki san do your best at this match with Moriman

80
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,000
"Fate deciding match - Moriman vs Yamasaki"

81
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,000
"The outcome will be seen at the second half of this program"

82
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,760
Matsumoto san, this time at the seats by the sparring ring

83
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,830
Are quite filled, aren't they?

84
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:21,630
Are they really going to come out from there? It was quite difficult buying tickets for that

85
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:25,230
Even if a celebrity would like to watch it, it'd be quite a task to get here

86
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,330
Even for Uchida Yuki

87
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,930
Today

88
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,430
So, enough of chit-chat, let's start

89
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,430
Yamasaki became a challenger now, didn't he?

90
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:44,030
First, the entry of the Challenger!

91
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,430
"Challenger Yamasaki Hosei"

92
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,430
You fools!

93
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:04,930
Whom are you telling this?

94
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,930
Fine, fine, we know you're angry

95
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,930
He's already undressing

96
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,830
Why did take that off already?

97
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:19,830
Next up in is the Champion's entry!

98
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:26,730
"Ass-match champion Moriman"

99
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:27,930
There she is
"Ass-match champion Moriman"

100
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:28,930
"Ass-match champion Moriman"

101
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,130
Long time no see

102
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,830
One point scored

103
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,530
There are no snots

104
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,130
What was that?

105
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,330
Are you an idiot? There's nothing coming out

106
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,230
What's the matter with him?

107
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,130
There's a flower ceremony for both parties

108
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,230
What a sight! Both sides should do their best today

109
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,730
Are you touched?

110
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,730
I'm very moved

111
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:29,230
So, without further ado, let's begin the match

112
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:36,330
Don't forget what you practiced before!

113
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:37,830
Don't give up!

114
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,530
Looks great!

115
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,230
That doesn't look good

116
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,930
"Champion Moriman victory"

117
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,630
This looks so pathetic

118
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:20,430
Yamasaki, that was too much

119
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,730
What are you going to do now?

120
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,830
Where are you going?

121
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,130
What was that?

122
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,130
Moriman, you idiot!

123
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:42,130
What's the meaning of this?

124
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,130
What are you doing?

125
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:47,630
How long have you waited for this day?

126
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,530
Why did I have to go through all this?

127
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,130
That's all because you're so damn weak

128
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:54,430
Shut up!

129
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:57,630
The hell you're talking about, you weakling

130
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,630
Shut up!

131
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:02,730
That's too harsh. That's bad.

132
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:07,730
You're 29 years old already and soon will be a 30-year-old

133
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,730
A 30-year-old

134
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,230
Shut the hell up yourself!

135
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,230
Stop talking about my private life!

136
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:18,030
We understood it, we understood

137
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,730
What are you going to do?

138
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,730
My privacy was exposed
