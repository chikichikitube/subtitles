The Future Century
Squadron: The Five Rangai 2001!

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,000
Takashi. Takashi, I have...
- Takashi and Yuko are so in love.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,800
We are newly wed. And tonight, in the bed
we are gonna . . . (humming).

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,970
Takashi.
- What.

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,450
I have to tell you something
I've never told you. - What?

6
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:25,820
I'm sorry I've never told you
this before. I... I, before I met you...

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,420
What? What is this?
- I's ... it's nothing.

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,420
Coming.
- Hey!

9
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,320
Long time, huh?
- Yes, long time.

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,970
How long is it since last time?
- Well... it's 3, 4... - Who he?

11
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,150
Takashi, he is...
- Who is he?

12
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,670
I got married.
- What?

13
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:50,050
He's my husband, Takashi.
- So, you are her husband.
- Yes. And you are?

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,570
Why haven't you told me?
- Hey! What you doing to Yuko?

15
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,000
You don't know our relationship?
- What?

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,220
No! There's no relationship!
In fact I don't even know him.

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,070
How come you don't know each other?!
- Hey! What's the matter with you?

18
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:04,570
This is just how he is.
- She was my sex slave.
- Sex what?

19
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,150
No he's lying!
- What does he mean by "sex slave"?
- Don't listen to what he's saying!

20
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,750
Hey! What are you doing?
- Heeelp!

21
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,200
Stop!

22
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,850
Red Rangai!

23
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,900
Yellow-Green Rangai!

24
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,300
Dark Green Rangai!

25
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,500
Greenish Rangai!

26
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,070
Let me spawn!

27
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,050
Our powers combined!

28
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,700
The Five Rangai!

29
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,350
Guys, run. Now!

30
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,100
Wait. Stop it.

31
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,620
I understand it's been a long time.
But, this is 5 Rangai, right?

32
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:55,170
You. Step back for a while.
- Let's me spawn!

33
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,150
Let me spawn like that night!
- I'll get back to you later.

34
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,300
What are you?
- Red Rangai!

35
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,900
And you?
- Yellow-Green Rangai!

36
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:12,300
Why Yellow-Green? And don't you think
your cap is little unmatched?

37
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,900
I took balance into consideration,
I mean, with other guys.

38
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,800
How about you?
- Greenish Rangai!

39
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,600
Why greenish?
You should be Green Rangai if anything.

40
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:31,050
If I call myself Green Rangai I have to
look perfectly green to anybody.

41
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:36,800
And people tend to have different
opinions about colors.

42
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:41,770
I'm just  Greenish so they can't say
I'm not Green.

43
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,250
What happened to you?
- Dark Green Rangai!

44
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,400
Originally I was Green Rangai.
- Is that so?

45
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,870
Can I have a few minutes?

46
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,050
Last night, I was washing my costume.

47
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,550
It's so careless of me.
I throw in this black sweater.

48
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,300
Dark Green Rangai!

49
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,100
I can say I'm Green.
But I don't want lie.

50
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,220
But why  you guys all stick to green.

51
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,900
Our team concept this time  is planning a
greening, a sort of.

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,150
To protect environment.
- Then you should get green costume too.

53
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,500
I wanted to give viewers
more impact by starting normally.

54
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,300
I came out as Red and other guys
betray their expectation. - I see.

55
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:40,720
You guys don't think of anything about
him when you came out with him?

56
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:58,500
Green is the color for this time, right?

57
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:06,200
And this was what I definitely wanted
to do when I thought of green.

58
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:16,300
But everything have its limit.
Especially when you try to help somebody.

59
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,050
This guy is insane.

60
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:32,500
I can understand your reasons.
Not this!

61
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,050
Ouch!

62
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,300
He's just insane. You should tell him.
You are the leader aren't you?

63
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:50,900
You are, because you are Red, right?
You should tell him when you gather up.

64
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:56,070
You should tell him he can't wear this.
- I respect their personalities.

65
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,100
But we can't tolerate everything for the
sake of respecting personalities.

66
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,900
Please not the belly.
- Just because you are a team doesn't
mean you should be so protective.

67
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,620
I could play my role if you guys
just do a decent job.

68
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:13,120
You have a point, but it's been
a long time. So just fight us, please.

69
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,470
Just bring it!
- Let me spawn!

70
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,600
Greenish Rangai!
- Dark Green Rangai! Ouch!

71
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,150
Get the hell out of here!

72
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,350
I've been saying this so many times
for so many years!

73
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:33,320
Do the job! Just once!
What are you trying to do?

74
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:38,450
Not the belly, please.
- Seriously not my belly...
- I don't give a damn! Out!

75
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,820
You're not going to fight?
- Just get out!

76
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,450
Wrong, wrong, wrong. You are the
only one. But I can't fight just with you.

77
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:50,300
It's your fault! You are the leader!

78
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:55,900
Hey! - Red Rangai!
- What kind of leader are you?

79
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,500
You piece of shit!
Quit it!

80
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,600
If you are too chicken-hearted
to say things straight just quit!

81
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:15,470
It's been a long time. I was
looking forward to do these actions.

82
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,900
Now, get out. Go.

83
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,720
Go!

84
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,750
Hey! Are you ok?

85
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,070
Just get out!

86
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,520
Itao, are you ok?

87
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,750
The Future Century Squadron:
The Five Rangai 2001!   The end.
