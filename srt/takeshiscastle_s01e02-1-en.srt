UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF MEDICAL EXPERTS,

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,870
TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE HEALTH

00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,670
Gather round,

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,030

00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,500
THE YEAR 1986

00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,570
Charge!

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,730
In 1986, a colossal battle broke loose.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,970
THE IMPENETRABLE CASTLE

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,330
A castle so impenetrable,

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,100
only eight out of 127 battles
have ever seen its halls.

11
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,170
8 WINS, 118 LOSSES, 1 DRAW
WIN RATE 0.06%

12
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,400
That dreadful castle has reemerged
in the Land of the Rising Sun.

13
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,470
JAPAN

14
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,770

00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,470
Takeshi's Castle is back!
Fortified with extravagance and fortitude,

18
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,470
packed with new games,
it's the palace of your dreams!

19
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,070
WHO WILL EMERGE
AS THE BOLDEST WARRIOR?

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,630
NO TIME FOR FEAR

21
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,730
I'll bring justice upon you numbskulls!

22
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,130
Have a look and see for yourself.

23
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,070
TAKE NO PRISONERS

24
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,270
Victory is ours!

25
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,100
I'm gutted!

26
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:13,630
Tear it down

27
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:15,600
to take home...

28
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,000
ONE MILLION YEN

29
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,830
I will destroy you!

30
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,400
I made it!

31
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,630
Here we go!

32
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,500
Fall, fall till you can fall no further.

33
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,670
Struggle as you may,
he has you in the palm of his hand.

34
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,030
DANCE...

35
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,200
The man of the hour
that you've all waited for...

36
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:41,270
IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND

37
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,530
ARMY VS TAKESHI

38
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,230
Takeshi's Castle!

39
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,900
TAKESHI'S CASTLE

40
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,330
An attack force
of 100 brave warriors has been sent

41
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,600
to bring down the first fortress,
Ueda Castle,

42
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,430
and its protector, Shinya Ueda.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,570
In the 34 years since its last battle,

44
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,470
Takeshi's Castle
has strengthened its defenses

45
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,970
and started vanquishing warriors
one after the other.

46
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:22,030
Sixty warriors have survived
and passed the third fortress.

47
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,170
SURVIVORS
60 WARRIORS

48
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:28,530
The road ahead forks in two directions,
with more battles waiting ahead.

49
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,730
FIRST CASTLE
UEDA CASTLE

50
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,900
That's funny.

51
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,930
After this, I'd like to move on

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,470
to a new game
that was developed for this event.

53
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,630
-New game?
-Yes, we created new and dynamic games.

54
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,570
FIRST CASTLE LORD
SHINYA UEDA

55
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,700
Can't wait to show you.

56
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,400
OSAMU SHITARA - YUKI HIMURA

57
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,400
-Good.
-But our staff is cruel.

58
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,370
It's clear they don't want
anyone to succeed.

59
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,530
This show has always been that way.

60
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,130
Listen up, the next game is Strong Arms!

61
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,530
ARMY CAPTAIN
SUBARU KIMURA

62
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:05,800
I doubt you've ever seen or heard of it.
Don't be intimidated!

63
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,370
I believe in your abilities to succeed.

64
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,170
Let's begin! Charge!

65
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,800
There are more of them than before.

66
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,430
TAKESHI'S ARMY
NISHIKIGOI - HASEGAWA AND WATANABE

67
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,600
It's the Nishikigoi duo.

68
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:25,530
Listen, Army,
not a single one of you will pass!

69
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,300
You shall not pass.

70
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,770
With these handles, I'm in control.

71
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,300
Think again if you think
you'll make it through here.

72
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,870
Hey!

73
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,100
ROTATE CLOCKWISE

74
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,500
You broke it, dummy!

75
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,670
Hey, what are we going to do about this?

76
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,430
Breaking a set prop
is the biggest fear of young comedians.

77
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:52,770
STRONG ARMS
DIFFICULTY RATING: 92%

78
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,400
-I'll do my best!
-She's a narrator.

79
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,500
NARRATOR
SHIZUKA KAWANA

80
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,030
-You got this!
-Go for it!

81
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,100
Stay calm!

82
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,330
RULES
DODGE THE ARMS AND GET TO THE OTHER SIDE

83
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,830
-You got this!
-She's making it!

84
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,800
Jump over it. Jump!

85
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,700
-Go for it.
-That was dangerous. She's tough.

86
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,270
Can she keep moving forward like that?

87
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,770
-It pushed her back.
-It totally got her.

88
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,170
-That's not good.
-Jump over it!

89
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,570
She's got great balance!

90
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,170
-Go!
-Well done!

91
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,030
She needs to hurry.

92
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,770
The next arm is coming.

93
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,900
-Good.
-Get back up.

94
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,200
She keeps getting pushed back.

95
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,970
-Keep moving after you jump!
-Take your time.

96
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,770
There she goes. She went for it.

97
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,970
Once you lose your balance, you'll fall.

98
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,230
So true. It's difficult.

99
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,700
Takeshi, I'll try my best!

100
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,800
HOUSEWIFE
MASAKO TOMITA

101
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,230
She's back after 35 years.

102
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,530
-She's a careful woman.
-Good. Easy!

103
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,830
Don't grab the bar.

104
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,970
This one's very difficult.

105
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,400
-Easy!
-Don't grab the bar.

106
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,070
-Here he comes!
-It's Chiitan.

107
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,770
OTTER FAIRY
CHIITAN (ETERNALLY 0 YRS OLD)

108
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,070
What is that thing?

109
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,270
What is that?

110
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,200
-That's Chiitan.
-Chiitan? Okay.

111
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,400
-Chiitan!
-That's gonna be tough.

112
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,530
-Everyone's excited.
-They're pumped.

113
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,800
Keep your guard up!

114
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,800
-Chiitan!
-Follow the arms.

115
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,130
-He's doing great.
-So far, so good.

116
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,200
No, be careful.

117
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,030
His head is too big.

118
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,800
-You got this!
-Go, Chiitan!

119
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,270
-Look up.
-His head is a nuisance.

120
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:36,970
Man!

121
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,200
That was silly.

122
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,370
BOULDERING WALL FAIRY
BORUNEESAN (FOREVER 33)

123
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,500
-Here comes another one.
-It's Boruneesan.

124
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,330
It's another yuru-chara.

125
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,300
What's that konjac ghost looking thing?

126
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,270
Neither of them can see their footing.

127
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,600
-Great move.
-No...

128
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,500
Too bad.

129
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,370
It looks like no one can do it.

130
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,730
NARRATOR: JUN HATTORI

131
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,700
Suddenly, the Army gained
a powerful helper!

132
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,130
CELEBRITY IMPERSONATOR
JACKIE-CHAN

133
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,500
Jackie-chan, known for his impersonation
of Jackie Chan takes on the challenge.

134
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:14,600
-He's a very strong athlete.
-Full steam ahead!

135
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,330
-Good job!
-It's like watching a Jackie Chan movie.

136
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,400
Kind of, yes.

137
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,770
-Nice! What?
-What's he doing?

138
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,000
He was supposed to be a ringer,

139
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,270
but fell into the water
after the second arm.

140
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,000
No way!

141
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,570
Why did they even bother calling him?

142
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,030
-You'd think he would do well.
-Right.

143
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,070
DAI HIRAYAMA (31)

144
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,800
The warrior's brave attack continued.

145
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:40,830
IMARI HIRAOKA (12)

146
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,500
-That was dangerous.
-Watch out!

147
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,470
That was dangerous.

148
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,100
Meanwhile, Macaroni
a member of Sengoku Resistance

149
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,030
came close to winning.

150
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,930
Hey, fall in! Fall into the water!

151
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,970
SENGOKU RESISTANCE
MACARONI

152
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,030
Just fall in!

153
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,800
You're doing great! Good job!

154
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,500
-He's doing it!
-Careful!

155
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,230
No! That's not good!

156
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,270
He was one arm away from the goal.
That was so close.

157
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,030
I thought he was gonna make it!

158
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:20,100
That was a close call. He got way too far.

159
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,330
Things are getting hairy.

160
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,430
From now on, we'll use a new weapon.

161
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,530
BUBBLE MACHINE

162
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,800
We'll make it even harder for them
to make it across using this machine.

163
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,700
Things just got a lot trickier!

164
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,730
Damn you, Nishikigoi!

165
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Our next challenger
is here looking for love.

166
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,600
-It's me. Here I go!
-It's Mayaya.

167
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,700
Go get 'em!

168
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,600
That's scary!

169
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,770
She's just looking for love.

170
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,400
LOOKING FOR MARRIAGE
MAYAYA (35)

171
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,600
Keep going, don't hold back!

172
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,730
Go!

173
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,270
-What happened?
-How did she...

174
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,200
Bubbles or not,
she lasted a mere six seconds.

175
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,170
Done way too soon.

176
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,870
Imoto, who came with her son,
has something to confess.

177
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,130

-I heart you!
-Right back at you.

181
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,070
-Good job!
-It's an all-out attack!

182
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,330
Keep going!

183
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,300
-Defeat her!
-Jump over it!

184
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,830
-Go!
-Hang in there!

185
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,870
You're doing great!

186
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,200
No!

187
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,700
She fell.

188
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,700
Any parting words for the captain?

189
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,200
I love you, Captain!

190
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:39,000
Thank you! Thanks for trying your best!

191
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:45,400
Unafraid of the bubble machine's power,
the army charges forward!

199
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,270
It was tough, wasn't it?

200
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:21,300
-I have no idea what just happened.
-Are you okay?

201
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:26,070
Next up, with an average age of 50,
is the Hibiya Horizontal Bar Club.

202
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,400
They're middle aged elites,
who work for major corporations.

203
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,670
HIBIYA HORIZONTAL BAR CLUB

204
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,600
I've already visualized
how we're gonna beat this game.

205
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,030
-We're absolutely ready.
-Yes.

206
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,300
I want to see them do well.

207
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,230
-I got this!
-Go for it, you 55-year-old.

208
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,670
HIBIYA HORIZONTAL BAR CLUB LEADER
TOSHITAKA HOSOI (55)

209
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:46,170
Go Hosoi, go!

210
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,830
The first one up is Hosoi,
who works for a foreign finance company.

211
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,130
-All right!
-Good job!

212
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,030
-Don't rush...
-No!

213
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,070
That ended too soon!

214
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,630
Why did he try to move so soon?

215
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,200
WHY DID HE TRY TO MOVE SO SOON?

216
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,630
Next up, Yoshio Yoda, an elite
from The University of Tokyo

217
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,470
and the oldest member of the team.

218
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:11,270
Move faster! Yes, he made it through.

219
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,970
His face is covered in bubbles.

220
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,800
-Nice, keep going!
-Come on!

221
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,530
-He's at the last arm!
-Look at him go.

222
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,400
What? Why did he fall?

223
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,370
-He was covered in bubbles.
-So close!

224
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,270
That's not good.

225
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,830
Yoda lost his vision
because of the bubbles.

226
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,800
He lost his balance
and fell in the final stretch.

227
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,230
The bubbles are working.

228
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,770
It's okay, we're doing better each round.

229
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,700
HIBIYA HORIZONTAL BAR CLUB
IPPEI SUYAMA (50)

230
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,170
Go, Team Hibiya!

231
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,170
Our third warrior, Suyama,
is a former elite diplomat.

232
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,230
Get past these bubbles if you can.

233
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,930
He's the same age as me.

234
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,000
-Try it.
-Hang in there. Nice.

235
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:51,470
-Wow! He's going for it!
-He passed the second arm.

236
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:54,630
-Keep going!
-He's one of the youngest in the club.

237
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,630
Get up! Get up and jump!

238
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,870
-Go!
-Jump over it!

239
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:02,370
-Come on, jump! Keep going!
-Almost there. Go!

240
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,700
He did it! He's doing it!

241
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,500
-He made it!
-Will he...

242
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,800
He did it!

243
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,670
-I did it!
-Nice job, Horizontal Bar Club.

244
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,030
-Well, look at that.
-Bubbles from head to toe.

245
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,900
He made it. Everyone is happy for him.

246
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,070
Take that!

247
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,630
-I did it!
-Great job!

248
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,900
-Aren't they his enemies?
-You're right.

249
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,170
-We're his enemies.
-They finally remembered.

250
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:35,600
He successfully made it over the third arm
that no one else had been able to clear.

251
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,400
At last, he's the first one
to clear the game.

252
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,270
He's our enemy,
but I'm happy he cleared it.

253
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,630
True, it feels nice.

254
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,470
-You're the first one to clear it.
-Really?

255
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,030
-Yes, you are.
-All right!

256
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,500
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

257
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,300
Even your enemies, the Nishikigoi,
were so happy, they high-fived you.

258
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,700
Follow his lead, everyone!

259
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:59,500
Make us proud, Marshall. You're our star.

260
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:04,700
Next up is the club's youngest member
and best athlete. Can he clear it?

261
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:07,830
-I'm afraid that they're gaining momentum.
-It's a problem.

262
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,830
-Let's stay on guard...
-Here he comes!

263
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,470
HIBIYA HORIZONTAL BAR CLUB
MARSHALL IKEDA (38)

264
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,030
-I'll do my best!
-Here he is.

265
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,930
Let's go!

266
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,870
-He's young.
-He's the youngest member.

267
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,570
Go, Marshall!

268
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,270
-Good pace.
-He started off...

269
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,200
-Wow!
-His movement is dynamic.

270
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,870
-It's like something out of a manga.
-Close call.

271
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,600
Nice, he's going to make it.

272
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,500
-The Horizontal Bar Club has great moves.
-He's gonna make it.

273
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,730
He's using the net to boost himself up.

274
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,130
Amazing.

275
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,630
Is he for real?

276
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,570
The Horizontal Bar Club is impressive.
Another one made it.

277
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:53,370
-Damn it, man!
-He beat us!

278
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,670
Let's keep up the good fight!

279
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,600
Tasked with following
those consecutive wins is this legend...

280
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,500
Here he comes.

281
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:04,100
A competitor
in the world-renowned show, Sasuke.

282
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:07,470
Katsumi Yamada, age 56,
is known as Mr. Sasuke

283
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,500
because he's been a contestant
since the show's first episode.

284
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,770
"MR. SASUKE" KATSUMI YAMADA

285
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:15,100
He arrived at Takeshi's Castle
carrying his historied reputation.

286
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,930
However, he failed to impress
at the Dragon God's Pond.

287
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,000
-He'll do better in Strong Arms.
-You think?

288
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:25,830
I'm challenging myself
to complete in all the games,

289
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,300
and show you every bit of what I can do.

290
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,100
It's meaningless
if I don't make it to the end.

291
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,270
He has no right to act so cool.

292
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:39,100
Yamada is set on winning
the title of Mr. Takeshi's Castle.

293
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,900
-His story can't end here.
-Good luck, Yamada.

294
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,570
MR. SASUKE
KATSUMI YAMADA (56)

295
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,100
He needs to redeem himself.

296
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,230
-Make sure he fails!
-Jump over them, Mister!

297
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,800
He has to win.

298
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,130
-Stay calm!
-He seems calm.

299
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,500
Go!

300
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,630
Jump over it!

301
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,400
Jump, now!

302
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,430
-Go for it!
-You can do it.

303
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,730
Hello!

304
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,770
No way!

305
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:13,570
That was the dumbest way
to go down. What was that?

306
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,770
That was awful. What was he thinking?

307
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,000
Why do we call him, "Mr. Sasuke"?

308
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:22,400
-That was awful!
-What happened, Yamada?

309
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,970
-No way!
-Why did he fall so soon?

310
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,030
-Can we see it again?
-It was just awful.

311
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,370
Mr. Sasuke tried to jump,
but couldn't find his footing.

312
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:34,070
He fell without ever getting
the chance to jump.

313
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,130
-Amazing.
-Man!

314
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,730
What went wrong, Legend?

315
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,530
-The bubbles...
-Yes?

316
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,330
The bubbles?

317
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,370
-...made things slippery.
-Obviously!

318
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:46,070
Bubbles are like that.

319
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,370
He's the worst!

320
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,530
The legend has failed,
but how about these guys?

321
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,970
The popular YouTube group, AUN.

322
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:59,030
Two out of their four team members
cleared Beach Boys and Girls.

323
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,000
Their physical abilities
are very promising.

324
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,200
They'll probably win the whole thing.

325
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,070
-They're strong contestants.
-They are.

326
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,400
ACROBAT YOUTUBERS
AUN - ACRE

327
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,970
-I'll show you how it's done!
-All right!

328
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,470
Acre!

329
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,130
First up is their leader,
who's been having a tough time.

330
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,530
Will he be able to redeem himself?

331
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,030
-He's the group's leader, right?
-Correct.

332
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,300
He's not that good.

333
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,830
ACROBAT YOUTUBERS
AUN - KANTA

334
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,630
-It's Kanta.
-I'll be the Team's first clear!

335
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,370
-Let's go, Kanta.
-Go, Kanta!

336
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,170
Next up is Kanta,
who has zero losses so far.

337
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,000
Wow!

338
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,500
-Great!
-Interesting choice.

339
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,300
-Well done, Kanta.
-Nice.

340
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,600
He's showing us some new tricks.

341
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,070
He's making good time.

342
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,870
-One more arm left.
-He'll make it.

343
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,770
-No...
-Wow.

344
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,330
-Well done!
-He made it happen.

345
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,600
Great. I think Kanta
should be their leader.

346
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,700
Don't say that.

347
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,600
-Nice!
-Great job, Kanta!

348
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,330
-He's excellent.
-Great.

349
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,930
-Clear!
-Well done, Kanta.

350
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,900
You made it look so easy,
like it was your daily commute.

351
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,070
That's a very short road.

352
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,270
No, this is not my commute.

353
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,330
In the end, five people beat Strong Arms,

354
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,500
and five received
the Fighting Spirit Award.

355
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,770
10 WARRIORS REMAIN

356
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,700
Five people made it.

357
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:26,600
Onto the next fortress, fearless Army.

358
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,070
Once again,
Yamada's performance was terrible.

359
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:33,030
You shouldn't talk down to him like that.

360
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,700
What has he accomplished?

361
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:38,770
In this one,
he just stood there, then he fell.

362
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,130
Wasn't that terrible?

363
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,930
Well, he's getting up there in age.

364
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,800
-It angers me.
-His body is deteriorating.

365
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,530
Don't compete then.

366
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,900
He's hilarious!

367
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,370
I have hope that he's gonna pull through.

368
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,630
That's why we keep giving him
the Fighting Spirit Award.

369
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,770
Haven't you given him too many chances?

370
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,970
Next up, a game as notorious
as the Dragon God's Pond,

371
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,570
"the Devil's Domain."

372
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,900
AVOID DEMON ATTACKS
AND MAKE IT THROUGH THE MAZE

373
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:12,100
This game has seen many iterations,
but what new traps will await this time?

374
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:26,200
Warriors, great job in making it this far.

375
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,170
Do you still have enough energy?

376
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,070
Yes!

377
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,530
Can you keep going?

378
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,430
Yes!

379
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,700
Good. Now look,

380
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,570
the structure behind you
is the Devil's Domain.

381
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:41,170
It's time, attack the next fortress!

382
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,330
Yeah!

383
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,630
Great!

384
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:51,130

387
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:56,570

That's awful.

-It's very disorienting in there.
-It really is.

406

Out you go!

407
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,570

00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,930
I thought he was a demon,
then he yelled at me.

IF YOU RUN INTO HIM,
HE'LL YELL AT YOU

422
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:44,330
-He just started scolding me.
-And how did you feel?

423
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,230
I was dumbfounded.
I wasn't expecting it.

424
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,730

-Watch out!

-He jumped in on his own.

-Keep going!
-Go! No, they got her.

483
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,200
No, they got her!

484
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,270
She was so close!

485
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,800
Just one door away!

486
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,500
That's the worst.

487
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,030

-Get out!

488
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,200
She's was right there.

489
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,330
Look at that.

490
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,630
The demons were onto her
but she ran away swiftly.

491
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,870
When they finally caught up to her,

492
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:57,270
the finish line
was just a stone's throw away.

493
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,770
What a shame!

494
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:04,100
How did I do? Did I get far?

495
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:07,100
-Yes, you were just one door away.
-Really? Just one door?

496
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,530
-Yes, you were so close.
-How frustrating!

497
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,300
When the target is a woman,
Kurochan can magically see through walls.

498
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:16,800
-I heard it's his special skill.
-That's not fair! He's the worst!

499
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:21,730
-I'll beat those demons!
-All right, here we go.

503

You're a blue demon now,
let's get married!

-She's trying to escape.
-No, Kurochan.

508
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,000
Why did he fall too?

509
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,470
Hey, why did you drag me with you?

510
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:56,500
-What happened?
-Tell us, what's going on?

511
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:01,000
He asked me to marry him,
so I brought him down with me.

512
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,130
-You jumped into the water with him?
-Yes.

513
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,700
-What? Can you explain what happened?
-Tell us.

514

The staff's gonna get mad at me again!

515
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:12,800
The next team hails
from the Shonan region.

516
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,800
Two families brought together
by the mothers' friendship.

517
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,130
Kids, are you watching?
Daddy will try his best!

518
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,270
-He's a young father.
-Very young.

519
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,770
-Go get it!
-You got this!

520
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:28,500
SHONAN FAMILY BESTIES
TAKAAKI SUGIYAMA (41)

521
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,370
-Nice.
-They haven't found him yet.

522
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:33,000
-Look at that.
-He might actually make it.

523
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:36,670
-No!
-He was so close.

524
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:38,570
Too bad for you!

525
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:44,570
The next door was the exit.

526
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,570
-That's right.
-I made a big mistake.

527
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:49,530
-There was no way for me to slow down.
-I see.

528
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,700
SHONAN FAMILY BESTIES
MISATO SUZUKI (34)

529
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,370
I will avenge my family!

530
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,300
-You can do it, Misato!
-Why is she giggling?

531
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,130
She's from the Shonan Family team.

532
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:03,800
-She's good.
-That's an old trick to not get caught.

533
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:04,970
She's doing great.

534
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,300
No! They're gonna get you!

535
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,800
-Nice. Run away!
-She's starting to panic!

536
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,130
-She's in trouble.
-No, she ran into the scolding man!

537
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,570
That guy is the creepiest of them all.

538
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:18,930
-No, don't put that on me!
-They got her!

539
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,030
-That old guy is the scariest.
-Agreed.

540
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,900
He's a random guy out of nowhere.

541
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:25,530
Your pretty face is ruined.

542
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:29,730
-Oh, no, Shonan Family.
-Whoa, they threw her out.

543
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,870
You're done for.

544
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,000
The strongest athletes
almost make it to the finish line.

545
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,100
SLACKLINING WORLD CHAMPION
KOI OKAZAWA (13)

546
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,330
Even the pro slackline rider, Matsumoto,
was one door shy.

547
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,230
-He was so close.
-Nearly there!

548
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:53,430
-No one has made it.
-It's a tough one.

549
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,200
Perhaps it's time to call on the gods.

550
00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:01,370
A young Shinto priest, Ikeno, who manages
three shrines will be put to the test.

551
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,800
A priest or a demon, who will win?

552
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,400
Let's go.

553
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:08,470
SHINTO PRIEST
YOSHIHIRO IKENO (27)

554
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,630
Here he comes.

555
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,900
Nice. He's doing great.

556
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,530
-He's fast paced. Will he make it?
-Nice. No, go around.

557
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:23,700
Hey, you. Wait.

558
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,200
-He made it.
-Wonderful. Well done.

559
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,870
-Way to go, priest.
-He knew where to go.

560
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:33,900
-Maybe god's will is real.
-Amazing job.

561
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,000
Well done. He was so calm.

562
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,870
What amazing luck.

563
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:42,230
The door he opened to escape a demon
was exactly the finish line.

564
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:47,500
And he just barely escaped another demon
coming in from the side.

565
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:51,400
Thus becoming the only person
to beat The Devil's Domain.

566
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,300
ONE WARRIOR REMAINS

567
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:55,100
-How cool. The lone winner.
-He is?

568
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:58,630
-Congratulations on your win.
-Thank you. I did it.

569
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,300
-You were very fast.
-Did you have amulets up your sleeve?

570
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:08,930
However, the real challenge
is making it to the final stage.

571
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,270
At this rate, the army will be wiped out.

572
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,800
It's been a tough fight.

573
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,530
Get him!

574
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,100
What the hell?

575
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:32,130
-We've got you now.
-Hold him down.

576
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:39,830
The demons got a hold of Captain Kimura...

577
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:47,030
and froze him in carbonite.

578
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,530
Why bother with these random storylines?

579
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,870
-I was--
-Lord Ueda, with this attack, the army

580
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:02,730
-won't be able to hold its ground.
-That's right.

581
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,570
We have their captain,
so the battle is ours now.

582
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,330
Serves you right.

583
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:14,870
Wait, I can't change characters quickly.
Don't drag me into this storyline.

584
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:19,370
An army without their captain
has no sense of direction.

585
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,470
-Was Kimura double-booked or something?
-No.

586
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,270
-That's not the reason.
-Not at all.

587
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,930
Let's see what AI count thinks about this.

588
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,970
-It's great that you've captured Kimura.
-Agreed.

589
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:35,000
-We've got him.
-Now the castle is safe.

590
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:38,630
Yes. But can we still host
the consolation games?

591
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,900
We want to see more.

592
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:43,070
You hear that? What do you think,
Ms. Momoi Kaori?

593
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:46,400
What do I think?

594
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:50,670
I can't be bothered with such a trivial--

595
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,400
What a bad impersonation. Who was that?

596
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,900
The ones he's not good at really stink.

597
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,000
CONSOLATION GAMES
REGISTER HERE

598
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,970
There are two fortresses remaining.

599
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:09,270
WIN ONE OF THREE GAMES
TO RETURN TO BATTLE

600
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:13,730
Consolation games are the last chance
for fallen warriors to return to battle.

601
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,930
Good luck.

602
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:20,300
The first consolation game is called
You Can't Save The Ball.

603
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:23,830
-I'll make miracles happen.
-Here's Rocket News.

604
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,370
ROCKET NEWS, EDITOR
MASANUKI SUNAKOMA (41)

605
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,630
This is good
since they're not good quizzers.

606
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,200
You're right. Hurry, hurry up.

607
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,700
Too slow. Like I said, too slow.

608
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:37,670
Those stairs must be taller than we think.

609
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:40,170
-They're pretty steep, too.
-You're right.

610
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:42,330
-Nice, it's right in the center.
-Go!

611
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,330
SENGOKU RESISTANCE
MARCO

612
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:48,730
Though he's the club leader,

613
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,300
Hosoi hasn't been able to contribute
to the team's success.

614
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,230
-Come on, leader.
-You got this.

615
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,100
HIBIYA HORIZONTAL BAR CLUB
TOSHITAKA HOSOI (55)

616
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,330
-He did it.
-Well done.

617
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:02,900
-The team must be elated.
-Yes! I passed!

618
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:03,900
RETURN TO THE FRONT

619
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,370
I did it!

620
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,800
-He's so happy. Did you see that?
-He made a comeback.

621
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:12,370
The next consolation game is called
Slip-and-Slide Quiz.

622
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,470
The quiz...

623
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:16,030
I'll win this round, no matter what!

624
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:21,630
Question, what color
is a giant panda's tail?

625
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,630
-Color of a panda's tail? Maybe white?
-A, white.

626
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,830
-B, black.
-Black or white...

627
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,830
-I think white.
-They're all the same?

628
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,200
TV PERSONALITY
MIYU KANDA (25)

629
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,400
-It was white.
-Oh, dear.

630
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,670
CORRECT ANSWER
A: WHITE

631
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:38,270
-It's not black?
-Nope. It's white.

632
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:42,000
-Which belongs to the dog family?
-Chiitan!

633
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:45,830
-A, cheetah. B, jackal.
-They look even dingier than before.

634
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,570
You got this, Chiitan.

635
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:52,070
-Chiitan is back in the game.
-So Chiitan had registered for it.

636
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:53,770
CORRECT ANSWER
B: JACKAL

637
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:56,700
Surprisingly,
Chiitan's trivia skills are strong.

638
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,970
RETURN TO THE FRONT

639
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,870
Chiitan is back in the game.

640
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,130
The last consolation game is called
Tug of War.

641
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:07,830
Here it comes.

642
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,730
-You got this.
-They're Sengoku...

643
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,400
-What was their name again?
-Sengoku Resistance.

644
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:16,230
Look, it's the AMA-WRES KYODAI.

645
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,270
Go for it!

646
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:19,400
Ready, go!

647
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:23,670
-This might be a good match.
-Those two are strong after all.

648
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:26,530
Winner, Takeshi's Army.

649
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,800
Ready, go.

650
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:34,100
In this game, your fate lies
in the opponent you draw.

651
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:35,330
COMPANY MANAGEMENT
TOMOYA NAKAMURA (45)

652
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:40,570
A weak opponent guarantees
your return to the frontline.

653
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:41,900
RETURN TO THE FRONT

654
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,330
TAKAGI BAKUFU LEADER
ASUKA TAKAGI (29)

655
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:48,100
But there were times the game
unfolded differently.

656
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:50,570
No... here he comes. It's Yokokawa.

657
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,770
Beware, the strength of a bodybuilder.

658
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:55,170
I feel bad,
so you ladies can work together.

659
00:31:56,170 --> 00:32:00,300
-He gave them a leg up.
-Two women set up to the plate.

660
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:02,270
-Start!
-Come on, you got this.

661
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,070
They might do it.

662
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,430
-This is a good match.
-Come on, I'm rooting for the women.

663
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:12,700
-They couldn't make it.
-Winner, Takeshi's Army.

664
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,800
You liar!

665
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,130
FEMALE COLLEGE STUDENT TEAM
MIRI KATO (21)

666
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,130
The team's last chance to stay in the game
rests on their leader, Kato.

667
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,530
-Who will be her opponent?
-Go get them.

668
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,770
-It's sumo wrestlers.
-That's a tough opponent.

669
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:30,700
-You got this.
-What--

670
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:32,230
Come on all of you, together!

671
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,000
The whole team?

672
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,900
Is that okay?

673
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,830
This battle will be two on five.

674
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:39,830
What will happen?

675
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,970
They're not budging.

676
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:46,570
-Wait, they might make it.
-Go, go, go!

677
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,100
They did it.

678
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:52,200
The other guy just stood there.

679
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,430
RETURN TO THE FRONT

680
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:57,500
-That's great. Well done. They're back.
-Thanks a bunch.

681
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:02,330
With brilliant teamwork, the crew
makes it back to battle. Congrats.

682
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:03,970
Nice job.

683
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:10,900
Our 29 heroes head to the sixth fortress,
hopeful to make it to the final battle.

684
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:11,900
29 WARRIORS REMAIN

685
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,600
Next up, an old audience favorite,
Mushroom Plop.

686
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:19,570
HOLD ONTO THE MUSHROOM
AND LAND ONTO THE FLOATING ISLAND

687
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,570
To check how tough it is,

688
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:25,970
a warrior from Takeshi's Army
tested it out.

689
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,500
TEST PLAYER
YUKI HIMURA, BANANA MAN

690
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:30,930
-It's high up here.
-I went to test it.

691
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,130
-They had you do it?
-Yes, I tried it out.

692
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,270
This is way too high.

693
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:37,730
Here I go. Really?

694
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:41,870
So like this--

695
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:48,200
Seriously? I can't even grab hold of it.

696
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,070
How does everyone else do it?

697
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,930
Just grab it.

698
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:58,870
-Are you serious? Hold on.
-There's no way I can do this.

699
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:02,500
-You're supposed to test it.
-Sorry, I can't get up there.

700
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:07,830
-An apology is not enough.
-You were supposed to test it out.

701
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,470
What the hell was that?

702
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:14,000
Honestly, I'm not even sure
why they used this clip.

703
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:18,400
With my weight and weak grasping power,
it's impossible.

704
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:20,130
Is it that hard?

705
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,730
We've brought the actual mushroom
to the studio.

706
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,400
Your arms won't make it around,
so use this rope.

707
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,870
-Hold like that.
-Do you want to try?

708
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:31,400
-Be careful.
-Please do.

709
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,700
Amazing!

710
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,030
-See, I did it.
-You're amazing.

711
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,900
That just wasn't a good day
for you, right?

712
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:42,030
-You might be right.
-It'll work today.

713
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,230
Maybe use momentum
to get your legs around.

714
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:50,830
I'm hopeless.

715
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,830
-Terrible.
-I can't do it.

716
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:57,570
This level is called Mushroom or Splash.

717
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:00,400
How many warriors
do you think will succeed?

718
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:03,370
Release the mushroom at the right time.

719
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:04,730
Exactly.

720
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,170
Well, that's the kind of game it is.

721
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:14,700
MUSHROOM PLOP
DIFFICULTY RATING: 90%

722
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:16,000
BIG FAN OF CAPTAIN KIMURA, HOUSEWIFE
KAORU IMOTO (45)

723
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,670
This is impossible.

724
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:18,900
Right?

725
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:20,270
I'll try my best.

726
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,800
-At least she's not slipping.
-Wow.

727
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,030
HOLD THE MUSHROOM
AND LAND ON THE FLOATING ISLAND TO WIN

728
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,230
-She's hanging on.
-Amazing.

729
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,300
This looks impossible.

730
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,130
-Good try though.
-She was close.

731
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:36,400
This is a difficult game.

732
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:40,470
TAXI DRIVER / MODEL / ACTOR
DAI HIRAYAMA (31)

733
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:43,300
It's tough even without it rotating.

734
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:44,470
That's dangerous.

735
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,300
He landed on his face.

736
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,430
DANCE LOVING DUO
MAYAYA (35)

737
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,600
Once I grab you, I won't let go.

738
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:56,170
-It's Mayaya.
-She's got a tight grip, too.

739
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,500
She might make it.

740
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:02,330
She fell. There she goes.

741
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,600
It's hard to stay on
once it starts turning.

742
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:10,530
Mayaya, who is looking for love,
fell much before the target,

743
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,130
arms and legs flailing in all directions.

744
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:15,400
I'll try my best.

745
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:17,200
Good luck.

746
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:18,930
SHED TEARS AT THE POND
IMARI HIRAOKA (12)

747
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,530
Nice. Keep going.

748
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,370
-You got this. Look carefully.
-Go.

749
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:24,930
So close.

750
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:29,900
That was really close.

751
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:34,570
Her timing was perfect,
but her aim was too far to the right.

752
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:38,030
-True. That looks painful.
-She's flexible though.

753
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,200
I'll try my best.

754
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,530
-Good luck.
-Shizuka!

755
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,830
NARRATOR
SHIZUKA KAWANA

756
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,030
You can do it!

757
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,270
-It's going fast. She made it.
-She did it.

758
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:53,630
-No way. Will it count?
-Seriously?

759
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,400
Really?

760
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:06,700
Lord Ueda, we put some slime on it.

761
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:09,870
So you have no plans
of letting them succeed?

762
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:10,800
Awful.

763
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,100
The game that's tougher than it looks,
Mushroom or Splash.

764
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:18,730
It's even hard to stay
on the floating island.

765
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,130
Best of luck, army.

766
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,630
-How do you beat it?
-It's so difficult.

767
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,830
Now, two guys
from popular YouTuber, Aun team.

768
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,470
ACROBAT YOUTUBERS
AUN

769
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:34,130
I've yet to fail any game.

770
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:38,030
Surprisingly, Kanta has won
every stage so far.

771
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,730
Can he achieve a complete victory?

772
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:44,500
On the other hand,
I've failed at everything.

773
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:48,000
-But I've won every consolation game.
-That's because he's Ryu the Phoenix.

774
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:52,670
Ryu is like a phoenix rising from
the ashes at every consolation game.

775
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,630
Let's hope he passes this round.

776
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:58,000
He's their leader, but we might not
see much of him.

777
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:00,070
TAKESHI'S CASTLE

778
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:04,270
The sun has set, plunging the stage
into a mysterious atmosphere.

779
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:06,470
-It's nighttime.
-This makes it harder.

780
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:10,000
First up is Kanta who hasn't failed yet.

781
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,970
I won't be defeated by a mushroom!

782
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:15,700
-This guy is strong.
-Will he achieve total domination?

783
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:19,970
Get it.

784
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,970
As expected, it's too tough.

785
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,900
-He slipped right off.
-It's a tough one.

786
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:31,230
-It's not easy to land that.
-It looked so slippery.

787
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:35,070
He let go of the mushroom
a smidge too late.

788
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:38,300
The dream to win all levels
disappeared in one fell swoop.

789
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,900
-Takeshi's Castle isn't that easy.
-That's no surprise.

790
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,930
Ryu, you got this.

791
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,370
You can count on me!

792
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:50,330
The lucky guy who crawled back
from two consolation rounds, Ryu.

793
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,270
PHOENIX WITH 2 CONSOLATION GAME WINS
AUN: RYU

794
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:56,130
-Wow. Amazing.
-Whoa.

795
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:00,470
-Wow. Amazing.
-Whoa.

796
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:01,870
How did he do it?

797
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:03,670
-This is incredible!
-The Phoenix!

798
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:11,230
-He did it, wow.
-I didn't think anyone would make it.

799
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:15,670
Yes, Ryu!

800
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,630
-This is great.
-Well done.

801
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,370
-Did you see that?
-He's loving it.

802
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:29,330
AUN's phoenix has risen again
to become the first person

803
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:33,800
to win in Mushroom or Splash
and move onto the final stage.

804
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:35,800
PASSED THE FINAL BATTLE
BEFORE UEDA CASTLE

805
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:38,130
-That was great to see.
-He did it.

806
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,930
-Congrats.
-Thank you.

807
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,100
This is first official game that I won
and I couldn't be happier.

808
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:45,830
Who would you like to shoutout to?

809
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,200
Shoutout to Japan...

810
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:50,530
No, shoutout to people all over the world.

811
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,930
-You had to think about it?
-Why did he switch gears?

812
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,470
-Isn't this a lucky streak?
-It is. Hope to keep it going.

813
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:03,930
This is the radiologist, Matsumoto,
who was able to beat Strong Arms.

814
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,270
Will he succeed
in Mushroom or Splash, too?

815
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,000
-He cleared it.
-He sure did.

816
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:12,030
I won't fail!

817
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:17,600
RADIOLOGIST
TOSHIHIRO MATSUMOTO (34)

818
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,170
He might do it.

819
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,870
Got it.

820
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,970
-How did he do it?
-Wow.

821
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:28,000
He's right on target.

822
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:30,330
How did he not slip off?

823
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:34,330
-I made it!
-Incredible.

824
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:38,570
-Incredible.
-That's amazing.

825
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:43,070
After landing, he almost slid off,
but managed to hold his ground.

826
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:45,270
-He almost fell.
-But he held on.

827
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:49,430
A momentous occasion of two winners
in a row. See you in the final battle.

828
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,230
PASSED THE FINAL BATTLE
BEFORE UEDA CASTLE

829
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:56,070
Hey, what's the deal?
The army is gaining in on us.

830
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,570
-I won't let them win any more battles.
-It's dire.

831
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,430
Take these additional rules.

832
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:06,530
We now have an added rule.

833
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,070
SMOKE MACHINE

834
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:12,530
You can barely see the floating island
through all that smoke.

835
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:17,830
Don't back down, fearless army.
Keep charging forward.

836
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:23,170
Why is the count suddenly so impatient?
Only two people passed the game.

837
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,030
He's ruthless.

838
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:28,970
Next up is Kato, the only warrior left
from the Female College Student Team.

839
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:32,130
-Good luck.
-I'll try my best.

840
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,730
-The island is hidden, right.
-It's terrible.

841
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,770
FEMALE COLLEGE STUDENT TEAM
MIRI KATO (21)

842
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:39,900
-Where is it?
-You can't see anything.

843
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:41,830
You got this.

844
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:49,830
Between the smoke and the lighting,
it's hard to gauge distance.

845
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,130
-That's too bad.
-How'd it go?

846
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,400
That smoke wasn't fair.
I couldn't see anything.

847
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:59,270
It obscured your vision.

848
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:01,830
-The smoke is too much.
-Even after this,

849
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:05,400
the Smoke Machine
continued to give the army a hard time.

850
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:07,930
-Why add it before the college girls?
-Yeah, why?

851
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,700
The difficulty rating
has dramatically increased.

852
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:15,070
One after another, the army
were plunged into defeat.

853
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:16,970
-It's unfair.
-The lighting is on, too.

854
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:19,530
Only two warriors have managed to win.

855
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:23,300
Not much of the army remains.

856
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,200
Look at all that smoke.

857
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,230
So close!

858
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,930
-But how will this man fare?
-Oh, yeah, this guy.

859
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,170
NO LOSSES SO FAR
WILL HE WIN THEM ALL?

860
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:38,070
Ikeno, the priest,
who has won all games so far.

861
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:40,270
Can he conquer Takeshi's Castle?

862
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:42,470
-He's amazing, isn't he?
-Yeah.

863
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,270
Here I go.

864
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:50,030
NO LOSSES SO FAR
SHINTO PRIEST, YOSHIHIRO IKENO (27)

865
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,670
-He failed.
-But he came close.

866
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:57,770
What a shame.

867
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:00,400
-He has lots of potential.
-Yes, he does.

868
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:03,230
It seems better to land on your back.

869
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,330
He let go just in time to land,
but landed in the water

870
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,900
due to too much momentum.

871
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:11,330
-Missed by a hair.
-He slipped.

872
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:14,530
But not all hope is lost.

873
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,030
HIBIYA HORIZONTAL BAR CLUB

874
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:19,100
Elite uncles with high potential,
the Hibiya Horizontal Bar Club.

875
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:25,930
Their strength is in their ability
to analyze their failures.

876
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:31,970
Not only did they enlist
their analytic flair to beat Strong Arms.

877
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:36,700
These heroes did it twice in a row.

878
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:39,100
They're our heroes.

879
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:41,130
This team really delivers.

880
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,670
We're finally utilizing
our full potential.

881
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:45,530
Your voice is ragged.

882
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:50,300
These guys are the athletes
and I'm the official cheerleader.

883
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:52,770
That's why my voice is ragged.

884
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,430
First up is team leader, Hosoi.

885
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:00,300
HIBIYA HORIZONTAL BAR CLUB LEADER
TOSHITAKA HOSOI (55)

886
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:05,000
-How do you stop with that momentum?
-You can't.

887
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:12,100
He managed to hit the target,
but couldn't stick the landing.

888
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:15,470
Is it better to jump from further ahead?

889
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:20,970
Next up is Suyama,
who was the first to win Strong Arms.

890
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:22,870
-You got this.
-You'll make it.

891
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:26,300
-Oh, no.
-No win this time...

892
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:29,100
You can do it, Marshall.

893
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:32,830
-What a shame. But he will.
-Marshall can do it.

894
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:36,130
Carrying the hopes of the team,

895
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,430
is Marshall Ikeda, the elite
who was born and raised in Canada

896
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,230
and speaks fluent English.

897
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:45,470
-Final stage, here I come.
-Marshall, Marshall!

898
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:49,330
The youngest star player. Will he make it?

899
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:52,870
There he goes.

900
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:57,630
Awesome!

901
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:01,600
Landing on your back is the key.

902
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:04,100
-You're right about that.
-Well done.

903
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:07,200
-How did he not slip?
-He's great.

904
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:10,870
-He did it!
-The Horizontal Bar Club is promising.

905
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:12,570
He jumped too late...

906
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:16,100
He made it, he did it!

907
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:17,800
I did it!

908
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:21,400
-He's the third one to win.
-I did it!

909
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:26,730
He quickly lifted his legs to keep
his balance just as he was about to fall.

910
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,000
He did do that.

911
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:31,770
He pulled through
and won his place in the final battle.

912
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:33,630
PASSED THE FINAL BATTLE
BEFORE UEDA CASTLE

913
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:36,430
-It's great, the guy before me cleared it.
-It's our guy.

914
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,930
-It's great.
-Right?

915
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:44,400
Our last warrior of the night is
Katsumi Yamada, aka Mr. Sasuke, 56.

916
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:47,130
He might put up a good fight after all.

917
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,830
He had high hopes of winning
the Mr. Takeshi's Castle title,

918
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:56,100
but his track record has suffered
not having a win since the Border Wall.

919
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,700
I keep falling but,
the Fighting Spirit Award has carried me.

920
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:04,070
So I hope to win
and have everyone congratulate me.

921
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:07,530
-Good luck!
-You got this!

922
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,430
Let's go!

923
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:14,930
Mr. Sasuke head to battle.

924
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,430
Yamada!

925
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:20,170
-Come on, Yamada, it's your last chance.
-He'll do it.

926
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:22,830
-I'll believe in him, too.
-He's Mr. Sasuke.

927
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:25,030
-Yamada!
-Yamada!

928
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,570
Everyone is so excited.

929
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:28,030
I'm ready.

930
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,600
-Yamada!
-Yamada!

931
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,970
Come on, hit the mark.

932
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:36,800
-Find the target.
-Wow!

933
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:40,370
Wow!

934
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,070
He couldn't stick it.

935
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:54,230
-He hasn't won a single game.
-No, he hasn't.

936
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:57,500
He hit the target in the middle.

937
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,070
It seemed like the perfect shot.
However...

938
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:06,070
Sadly, Mr. Sasuke slid overboard.

939
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:10,330
He's been falling in water all day.

940
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,300
-Not just here. All day.
-Sadly, he fell.

941
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:15,100
3 WARRIORS REMAIN

942
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:20,200
With three warriors remaining,
we now move on to the final battle.

943
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:23,370
We can stop calling Yamada back now.

944
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:26,870
We finally saw his final round.

945
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:28,400
I must say,

946
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:33,730
our staff is horrible
at gauging difficulty levels.

947
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:38,530
You're telling me they even put slime
on the floating island?

948
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:42,130
Lord Ueda, please keep your voice down.

949
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:46,100
It's supposed to be a secret.
When I went to test it,

950
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:50,500
the senior staff member
was tossing something like this.

951
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:53,870
I can't say for certain
whether it was slime or not.

952
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:56,330
There's no doubt about it.

953
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,430
-Anyhow, we have three warriors remaining.
-Amazing.

954
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,330
We'll fight them in the final round.

955
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,130
3-ON-3 FIGHT WITH THE LORDS
ARMY GETS A MILLION YEN IF THEY WIN

956
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,200
The three of us will fight them?

957
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:11,430
Yes, Lord Ueda,
you'll be in the final battle.

958
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:14,400
-It's a good number to battle with.
-That's right.

959
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:17,500
-Correct, our staff is very smart.
-Okay, I see.

960
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:22,300
Shall we say hello to the AI count
before the final battle?

961
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:26,500
-I thought there should be more slime.
-There was plenty.

962
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,400
-That's why he's the count.
-It wasn't enough?

963
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:33,300
You better win.
Three warriors made it to the end.

964
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:37,770
We'll be okay. Our staff doesn't want
to give a million yen to anyone.

965
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:42,200
Can we have a word of support, Mrs. Dewi?

966
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:47,730
I was playing a game
called Laugh or Splash.

967
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:52,370
I also played Sumo or Splash,
Calligraphy or Splash, splash, splash...

968
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:56,770
That's what I was doing with my time.

969
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,870
What horrible quality.

970
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:03,530
At this point, Count Takeshi
is simply having fun roasting people.

971
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:07,500
Let's do our best in this final battle.
Shall we get going?

972
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:09,070
All right, let's win.

973
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:18,930
The army is at a disadvantage
without their Captain Kimura.

974
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:24,130
Nonetheless, our heroes head to
the final battle ground, Ueda Castle.

975
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:32,230
The Lord will now make his appearance.

976
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:40,830
You already broke it.

977
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,900
He's already breaking things.

978
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:44,600
THE FIRST CASTLE'S LORD
SHINYA UEDA

979
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:47,270
I'll bring justice upon you fools.

980
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:51,730
-This lord is a little unhinged.
-See this.

981
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,430
Now it's just a dead weight.

982
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:58,030
I'll attack them by throwing this.

983
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,300
He's off his rocker.

984
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:04,730
Lord, Captain Kimura
is already our prisoner.

985
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:09,370
I've seen many props in my day,
but this has the least production value.

986
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:13,070
-Don't say that. Look there.
-Don't say it.

987
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:18,570
Look at the three warriors
just standing there, defenseless.

988
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,030
You fools.

989
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,300
-We have to say something back.
-Yes.

990
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:25,570
Tell them how you're all feeling.

991
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:27,530
You've made it this far.

992
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:30,330
-I'll do my best.
-Sounds good.

993
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,670
-I'll conquer this battle!
-Great.

994
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:35,970
I'll give it my all.

995
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:37,400
-There you go.
-Excellent.

996
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,700
-How about that?
-They're riled up.

997
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:44,330
-What do you think?
-They're no match for us.

998
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,030
-Then let's finish this swiftly.
-Not a problem.

999
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:49,270
YABUSAME

1000
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:51,100
The final battle is called Yabusame.

1001
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:53,470
HIT THE OPPONENT'S TARGET ON THE CARRIAGE
DRAW IF BOTH PLAYERS HIT

1002
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:58,530
A warrior from each team rides a carriage,
but only the army's will pass by.

1003
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:02,630
Shoot and aim for the target
on the opponents carriage.

1004
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:08,200
The army wins if their ball makes it
into the red basket.

1005
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:12,300
Takeshi's Army wins
if they hit the blue target.

1006
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:17,270
But if both teams hit their target,
it's a draw and no points are granted.

1007
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:20,870
Here comes the launching carriages.

1008
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:32,330
-I like how flashy it is.
-Let's head over to it.

1009
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,900
-Nice and flashy.
-Lord Ueda, you're up first.

1010
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:40,830
I like it.
It kind of feels like I'm stepping into

1011
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:44,900
-a Gundam robot or something.
-Yes. Because it has a cockpit.

1012
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,870
The first warrior is...

1013
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:53,370
Lucky boy, Ryu, from AUN. The phoenix who
keeps returning from consolation games.

1014
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:56,530
He proved his athletic abilities

1015
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:00,130
after beating the challenging game,
Mushroom or Splash.

1016
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:04,070
I will win. No matter what.

1017
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:08,600
We're honored that our teammate
is in the final battle.

1018
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:11,170
-We are.
-I'm so proud of him.

1019
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:13,670
I hope he brings us to victory.

1020
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,830
The army's target is a hole
that's barely wide enough for the ball.

1021
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:25,230
Can he bring down Takeshi's Army
in this unfavorable situation?

1022
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,600
RYU VS SHINYA UEDA

1023
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:31,630
Lord Ueda will face the army
in the first round.

1024
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:32,900
What will happen?

1025
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:38,370
YABUSAME
DIFFICULTY RATING: 200%

1026
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:41,270
-Now for the final game, Yabusame.
-All right.

1027
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:43,370
A SINGLE ARMY WIN EQUALS
THE ONE MILLION YEN PRIZE

1028
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:46,630
Lord Ueda, beware.
Those are some tough warriors.

1029
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,300
Leave it up to me.

1030
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:51,300
-All I need is one shot.
-Sounds good.

1031
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:54,130
Let's begin the first round.

1032
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:01,470
Begin!

1033
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:22,770
-You hit it!
-You got it!

1034
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:26,030
-You got the target.
-See that.

1035
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,800
-Damn it!
-Okay!

1036
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:29,830
THE ARMY HAS FAILED

1037
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:34,630
Is that game over?

1038
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:37,300
Winner, Lord Ueda.

1039
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:40,030
TAKESHI'S ARMY WINS

1040
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:42,700
It happened so fast,
I don't know what happened.

1041
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:44,700
Isn't it too difficult?

1042
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:51,330
The army's ball came close to the target,
but didn't hit the bullseye.

1043
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:57,330
In comparison, Lord Ueda
missed with the first five balls,

1044
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:01,570
but hit the target
with the sixth and seventh.

1045
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:05,600
Ryu, the army's first warrior,
is defeated.

1046
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:07,400
DEFEAT

1047
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:08,930
Was it hard?

1048
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,130
Well, the carriage moves faster
than expected.

1049
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:17,630
And the opponent's target is very small.

1050
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:21,330
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,

1051
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:25,000
but our team has been setup to dominate.

1052
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,600
It happens so quickly.

1053
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:28,200
Yesh, it happens so quickly.

1054
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:29,800
I'll try to enjoy it.

1055
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:33,500
Next up is Matsumoto, the radiologist.

1056
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:38,100
He hasn't lost any game so far.

1057
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:40,470
He is the best of the best.

1058
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:43,070
A SINGLE ARMY WIN EQUALS
THE ONE MILLION YEN PRIZE

1059
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:45,870
Yuki Himura will defend
Takeshi's Castle next.

1060
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:49,300
I'm starting to feel nervous.

1061
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:52,770
There's more pressure
because we have the advantage.

1062
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,130
MATSUMOTO VS HIMURA

1063
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,970
Can the army make a comeback?

1064
00:54:57,030 --> 00:55:00,100
Yabusame, round two.

1065
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:01,830
-Let's begin.
-Go for it!

1066
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,870
Begin!

1067
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:13,670
-You got this.
-Good luck!

1068
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,700
Go, shoot!

1069
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:37,870
-Nailed it.
-You finally got it.

1070
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:42,000
THE ARMY HAS FAILED

1071
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:43,530
Hurrah!

1072
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:45,700
TAKESHI'S ARMY WINS

1073
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:48,070
-Good job, Himura.
-Thank you!

1074
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:51,030
I got nervous because it took so long.

1075
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:54,370
Himura aimed
without taking continuous shots.

1076
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:59,530
He had already hit the target
on the third shot without realizing,

1077
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:03,770
and hit it a second time
on the fifth shot, for good measure.

1078
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:10,100
The army's first shot actually
hit the edge of the target.

1079
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:13,930
It's true, the army had put up
a good fight.

1080
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:20,270
Multiple shots reached the opponent's net.
One even made it inside.

1081
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:24,100
It was a mere centimeters away
from the target.

1082
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:29,900
-One of them hit the net?
-That was close.

1083
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:31,570
I just barely made it out.

1084
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,600
I didn't get hit by any.
My defense is flawless.

1085
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:37,600
We have no means of defense.

1086
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,070
Last up is Marshall Ikeda
from Hibiya Horizontal Bar Club.

1087
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:46,670
-Do you want to switch?
-Your voice is ruined, but cheer for me.

1088
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:49,770
He is the youngest
and the star player of the team,

1089
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:53,030
who's won all battles except
the Dragon God's Pond.

1090
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:56,930
The team's hopes for victory
ride on his shoulders.

1091
00:56:58,130 --> 00:57:02,000
We've seen the mistakes
of two other players.

1092
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:04,930
I believe in him. He learns quickly.

1093
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:07,570
What's your plan of attack?

1094
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:10,770
I'll turn my weapon to 90 degrees

1095
00:57:10,830 --> 00:57:13,900
and keep shooting relentlessly
at the target.

1096
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:16,230
-I see.
-All that's left is to pray.

1097
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:19,470
A SINGLE ARMY WIN EQUALS
THE ONE MILLION YEN PRIZE

1098
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:22,000
Osamu Shitara will defend
Takeshi's Castle.

1099
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,830
The fate of Takeshi's Castle
is in my hands, so I can't lose.

1100
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,170
-You can't.
-No.

1101
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:30,270
IKEDA VS SHITARA

1102
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:32,530
Can the army make a miracle comeback?

1103
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,370
Yabusame, the final round.

1104
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:39,600
-You're up for the final round, Shitara.
-Here we go!

1105
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:43,130
-I'll finish this in one shot. No sweat.
-One shot?

1106
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,470
Really? Can we give you fewer balls then?

1107
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:48,070
No way.

1108
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:51,370
-You better win.
-There's no way I'll lose.

1109
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:54,100
-All right!
-Oh, no, I'm starting to get nervous.

1110
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:58,970
-Let's begin the final round of Yabusame.
-All right!

1111
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:11,900
-Good luck!
-You got this!

1112
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:17,200
-Shoot!
-Keep going!

1113
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:22,730
-Shoot!
-Just keep shooting!

1114
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:28,230
Shoot!

1115
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:33,430
You used all the balls.

1116
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,600
THE ARMY HAS FAILED

1117
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:37,500
-Well done.
-You hit it a ton.

1118
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:39,500
TAKESHI'S ARMY WINS

1119
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:41,070
You got so many hits.

1120
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:46,370
The army came close
but couldn't hit the opponents target.

1121
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:52,600
Far from using a single attack,
Shitara attacked with consecutive shots.

1122
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:58,930
With a total of eight hits,
the army has perished.

1123
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:02,600
Hurrah!

1124
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:06,730
You shot like you were in The Godfather.

1125
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:11,200
-I had to make sure we won.
-It felt good though.

1126
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:16,000
In conclusion, victory is ours!

1127
00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:18,300
TAKESHI'S ARMY WINS

1128
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:27,870
-Wonderful.
-That was great.

1129
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:31,400
What a great place Takeshi's Castle is.

1130
00:59:31,470 --> 00:59:35,270
To express my gratitude, I'll replace
my chainsaw from Amazon after this.

1131
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:39,770
I want this game in Hibiya Park.

1132
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:43,170
-They're about to redevelop the park.
-Let's go lobby.

1133
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:46,170
Let's suggest it. We'll start a petition.

1134
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:50,800
-We want this instead of our jungle gym.
-They can have them.

1135
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:58,370
I can't believe
they let the army get that far.

1136
00:59:58,430 --> 01:00:00,900
Lord Ueda is spineless.

1137
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:10,800
What? The captain has disappeared?

1138
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:13,200
I have no choice.

1139
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,930
I guess it's my turn to take charge.

1140
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:21,830
NEXT EPISODE
MUSCLE HEADS ATTACK

1141
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:24,200
The battle to overthrow
the second fortress begins.

1142
01:00:24,270 --> 01:00:28,670
An army with great physical strength,
from Sasuke competitors and athletes.

1143
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:33,670
With so many winners,
they just might take Takeshi's Castle.

1144
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:35,030
We did it!

1145
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:39,170
I want to become Mr. Takeshi's Castle.

1146
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:42,330
THE BATTLE OF KATSUMI YAMADA
BEHIND THE SCENES

1147
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:51,170
HE ENCOURAGED EVERYONE
MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE

1148
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,730
Rock, paper, scissors.

1149
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:59,170
HE BOOSTED MORALE WITH UNMATCHED PASSION

1150
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:02,170
Rock, paper, scissors. Yay!

1151
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:05,630
Thank you. Hurrah!

1152
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,800
Say cheese.

1153
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:10,330
HE MADE MORE MEMORIES
THAN ANYONE ELSE

1154
01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:20,170
AND HELPED MORE PEOPLE
THAN ANYONE ELSE

1155
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:22,400
-Thank you.
-Did you make it?

1156
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:27,830
Without Sasuke, I wouldn't be here.
Thank you very much.

1157
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:34,470
BUT HE DIDN'T PERFORM
BETTER THAN EVERYONE ELSE

1158
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:38,270
This is too pitiful.

1159
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:42,400
What is there to prove
that I'm Mr. Sasuke?

1160
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:44,870
Damn it...

1161
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:46,900
THANK YOU, MR. SASUKE
