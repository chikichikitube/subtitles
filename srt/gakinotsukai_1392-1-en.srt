1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,480
First time ever on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,560
Ikinari Steak 100,000 yen

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,220
Yamanote Line, 37 store,

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,940
Completion Challenge!

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,340
You did not speak clearly at all

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,810
You bit your tongue

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,250
You sprained your ankle,

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,960
It didn't feel like I tripped

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,560
It's been 6.5 months since we did this

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,620
We're doing this at our age?

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,620
6.5 half years

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,560
By the way, has anyone been to Ikinari Steak before?

13
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,820
I've, one time,

14
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,210
Never

15
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,210
No

16
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,210
Nope

17
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,110
I have

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,790
You haven't?

19
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:48,420
TN: Ikinari = Suddenly

20
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,420
So it's actually suddenly steak?

21
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,740
A store where you can eat great steaks,

22
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,760
A national chain brand, Ikinari Steak!

23
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:05,080
At every store, the 5 will work together to finish 200g of steak

24
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:13,140
Starting at Ginza Yonchome, they aim to finish all 37 stores along the Yamanote line

25
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,040
It's 200g per store for all 5

26
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,840
So 40 per person

27
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,310
So 37 stores

28
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,610
So 13kg per person

29
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,720
It's not that high
That's not true

30
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,220
What exactly did you calculate?

31
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,860
What did you write down?

32
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,000
The staff are going "No no no no"

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,690
They're all highly educated people

34
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,040
We're all morons here

35
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,340
If they finish all 37 stores, they win 100,000 yen

36
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,290
But if anyone gives up, the challenge ends

37
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,260
Whoever gives up has to pay for all food eaten thus far

38
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:59,700
Ikinari Steak Food Marathon - First, they choose their steak at Ginza Yonchome

39
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,980
This is the menu at Ginza Yonchome,

40
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:07,280
You will draw balls here to decide your item

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,280
I see

42
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,100
We'll get to eat a bunch of stuff

43
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,350
Hamada-san first,

44
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,730
What, me? What about Yama-chan?

45
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:14,730
Leader!

46
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,700
Why am I "Leader"?

47
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,200
What did you get?

48
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,760
Middle rib?

49
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,500
Compared to top rib, it is fattier and has better marbling. A tender and complex steak.

50
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,500
I see, I see

51
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,060
Nice to have this for the first one

52
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,670
It is possible to get this again though

53
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,980
We put the ball back in?

54
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,160
It would be better if it was cleared

55
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,480
It doesn't clear if you eat it

56
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,420
Oh really?

57
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,090
We'd be done by the fifth store otherwise

58
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,660
The least educated member?

59
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,260
He failed his boating license you know

60
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,100
I got the license

61
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,500
He thinks we're on a boat

62
00:02:53,170 --> 00:03:00,090
Typeset by GakiDave
Translation by senor_wristband

63
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,900
Is there like, a steak sauce?

64
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,400
There is

65
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,360
We can use that if we want right?

66
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,680
And, if you want, you can order from the side menu

67
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,010
Screw that

68
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,270
Why?

69
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,210
Why would we?

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,140
They have like black oolong tea,

71
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,900
That would be good
They have salad too

72
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:22,490
TN: "Sara-to" means easily; "Sarado" means salad

73
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,690
You can shove it down "sara-to"

74
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,570
Salad and "sara-to", I can't believe you...

75
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:27,640
"Sara, sara, sara, sara", I just hate that

76
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,820
Sorry, so we have to split it right?

77
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,310
It's up to you guys

78
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,380
There's unwanted items too

79
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,620
There are unwanted items?

80
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,660
I can only eat if it's well done...

81
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,880
Ah, the doneness,

82
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,290
Oi, Busjack, the hell are you saying

83
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,360
That's one hell of a nickname

84
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,540
That's his nickname?

85
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,540
Well done?!

86
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:01,250
They arrive at the first store, in Ginza Yonchome

87
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,520
There's not many people

88
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,720
The time, right

89
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,660
Usually lots of salarymen

90
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,980
So everyone, here

91
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,380
We'll order first

92
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,470
This is the rib steak

93
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,320
Middle rib?

94
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,010
This is where they cut the meat

95
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,150
It's gonna be like this here?

96
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,720
It's the first store I guess

97
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,880
There may be some variation in the weight

98
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,060
224 grams

99
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,240
224 grams?

100
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,690
That's ok!

101
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:59,190
I recommend cooking it rare

102
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,800
I'd like it well done, please.

103
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:07,160
We'll get it done medium-rare.

104
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,300
Understood

105
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,300
Everyone, the table,

106
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:22,420
The steak cut in front of their eyes, grilled using charcoal

107
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,850
I'm starting to feel hungry

108
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:29,060
I'm feeling it, the hunger is being invited

109
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,540
You, eat the fat only

110
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,520
I can't eat the fat, seriously

111
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,460
I can't eat the fat either

112
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,460
I can't

113
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,260
What's with you guys? Now, here?

114
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,030
"I can't eat this, I can't eat that"

115
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,820
You haven't eaten a single bite yet

116
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,560
Oh, here it comes!

117
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,760
It's sizzling

118
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,320
I can totally finish this

119
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,750
1 person could eat this too though

120
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,490
Oh really?

121
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,220
Like, suddenly,

122
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:05,140
Shit I said "Suddenly"

123
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,140
After telling us not to

124
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,640
First, they all taste the steak,

125
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,920
You're cutting on the skillet?

126
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,920
Yes, yes,

127
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,920
I see

128
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,240
I could eat this in one bite

129
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,000
Here I go

130
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,240
This amount is good, I can finish this no problem

131
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:50,240
I want more

132
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,410
The steak is finished in a blink,

133
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,880
Just the corn and onion is left

134
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,520
Maybe Endo should be responsible for the corn

135
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:05,640
My favourite food ever is grilled corn, actually

136
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,400
I thought it was soybean flour

137
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,530
Oh yeah, grilled corn is second then

138
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,500
This won't be aired

139
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,230
Woah, I can finish this

140
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,950
Is it no problem?

141
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,960
Finished!
Marvelous

142
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,510
Truly marvelous

143
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,910
Still hungry, they head to the next shop

144
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,920
They choose the steaks before leaving

145
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,800
Sirloin!

146
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Ah, sirloin steak!

147
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,090
We're getting the sirlon steak.

148
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,460
How shall we cook it?

149
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,390
Alright Endo, you decide

150
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:50,300
Well Done

151
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,180
We're heading to the second store

152
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,910
It's hot, isn't it?

153
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,910
It isn't!

154
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,910
Sorry

155
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,140
You've been saying this the whole time

156
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,000
It's so hot!

157
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:19,190
Right after the start, Matsumoto starts complaining about the heat

158
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,820
Is the heating alright?

159
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,890
No heating?

160
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,820
The heater is definitely on

161
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,130
It's annoying, right?

162
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:26,320
Complaining "It's hot!" by himself

163
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,470
And next,

164
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,880
Why do the curtains need to be closed?

165
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,440
If people see your faces from outside,

166
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,320
they might take pictures, and such

167
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,320
Who cares

168
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,240
Not being able to see outside is depressing

169
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,720
We're all thinking it; "What a pain in the ass"

170
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:48,020
"This guy is annoying after all"

171
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,660
They arrive at Ginza 6-chome

172
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,460
"Suddenly" we are here

173
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,320
So exciting!

174
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,600
He pushed this pull door first though

175
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,720
He definitley pushed it first
So "Sudden"

176
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,520
From Australia, Naruo specialty beef Sirloin Steak

177
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:24,660
This time the steak will be served well done, because of Endo's insistence

178
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,430
It's so cooked

179
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,240
Hoisei-san, what's that?

180
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,240
Wasabi!

181
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,890
What to do with the corn?

182
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:56,790
There is a corn lover here

183
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:02,360
Endo's well done is really pissing me off

184
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,360
After eating it

185
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,280
Finished!

186
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,080
Let's go to the next store

187
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,580
The next store they arrive at, Yurakucho store

188
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,870
This kind of store is nice

189
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:32,020
Here they enjoy a rare US Angus sirloin

190
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,880
What do you think Endo?

191
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,010
Tashty

192
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,470
The tenderness stands out

193
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:50,980
He put wasabi on his soy sauce

194
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:00,260
The corn is so plump and delicious

195
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,520
I messed up, making Endo eat the corn by himself

196
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,060
Do you want some?

197
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:08,060
Nope, it's a rule now

198
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,470
Something like this, would really fill us up

199
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:15,840
That's good information, you can have ingen with that

200
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,400
You can swap the corn for another topping

201
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,000
Hurry up and eat!

202
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,390
Why so angry, all of a sudden?

203
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:42,100
He hits the wall in sync with his laugh

204
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,130
What happened?

205
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,630
He's finished!

206
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,610
Isn't this easier than Gyoza?

207
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:00,920
Still feeling hungry, they arrive at the 4th store

208
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,300
I want some rice

209
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:07,040
That make sense, some white rice

210
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,620
Should we order white rice?

211
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,300
Not yet

212
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,320
What I really want is some red wine

213
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,820
I think I'll have a little bit

214
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:29,710
Ikininari Steak 4th store in Toranomon, where Matsumoto has been before

215
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,720
The red wine is here

216
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:37,960
Matsumoto's red wine

217
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,050
He has to finish it right?

218
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,460
Yes

219
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,460
You never said that before

220
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,790
Sorry, a bit late

221
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,330
Tell me that at the first meeting

222
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,800
You should've told me when I first met you

223
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,240
You want a little, right?

224
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,980
I'm driving home

225
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,370
No you aren't!

226
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:04,350
You dirty Kansai comedian!

227
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,420
The rules allow the 5 to share it

228
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:13,640
But since nobody wants any, he has to drink it himself

229
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,850
Where should I place this?

230
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,330
Here

231
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,030
In front of Endo

232
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:23,300
In front of ... Endo?

233
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,330
Yoshida-san, I'm Endo.

234
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,370
"In front of ... Endo?"

235
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:38,660
This time, Ingen replaces the Corn. The sirloin steak is done medium.

236
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,650
Fantastic

237
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,040
This is way better

238
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,640
Just gulping it down

239
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,140
It's super delicious

240
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,430
All finished.

241
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,300
Matsumoto you have some wine left

242
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,230
Wait listen

243
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,360
I was never told anything

244
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,780
Enough of that joke now, just take a sip someone

245
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:13,950
I can't move!

246
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,390
Is it always this much?

247
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,280
This is the standard amount?

248
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:22,180
Yes, that's a large serving!

249
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,180
It's a large, right?

250
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:26,660
That's the large one?

251
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,660
Yes, yes it is

252
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,660
Yoshida-san, you certainly are unique!

253
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,320
Right?

254
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,320
Definitely unique.

255
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,440
A little out there

256
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,910
I've been here before actually

257
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,910
Eh-?

258
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,780
Eh-!

259
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,070
In front of Endo

260
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:48,580
In the end, Matsumoto finished it himself

261
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,580
Man, I'm drunk

262
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,560
Where we going?

263
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,860
Shimbashi Kabiyaguchi

264
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,380
Is it a long drive?

265
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,800
It's basically 10 minutes away

266
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,800
That's amazing,

267
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,670
This Ikinari! Steak network

268
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,740
Ikinari! Steak network

269
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,910
Even cows use it

270
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:22,920
At the 5th store in Shinbashi, they get their Rib Roast steak done medium

271
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,860
Sorry for the wait

272
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,600
It looks amazing

273
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:36,400
This rib roast is aged for 20 days to bring out the flavour

274
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,570
That looks amazing!

275
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,570
Yeah

276
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,240
This is so different, it's suddenly ...

277
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,870
Don't say sudden!

278
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,760
Piece of shit

279
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,580
What else would I say

280
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,000
I got it cut

281
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,300
It's way different from the others

282
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,710
Tender and delicious

283
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,560
I think I'm gonna stop getting well done now

284
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:15,100
Nobody likes well done

285
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:20,880
I want medium even if it means I'll die

286
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,080
Finished!

287
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,780
He's going like "ahhh"

288
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:37,700
It sounded like a huge one got out

289
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,700
Something huge came out

290
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,390
It did

291
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,220
It means "I'm finished"

292
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,100
Like an old man waking up

293
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:52,760
A groan from Hamada

294
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,580
Are you ok?

295
00:16:53,800 --> 00:17:00,460
Now that everyon'es eaten 200g, the amount consumed has passed 1kg

296
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,860
They decide steaks for the 6th store in Shimbashi

297
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:08,780
Tenderloin

298
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,780
Nice!

299
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,890
Is Ingen alright?

300
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,890
Ingen, hmm

301
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,000
Potato

302
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:21,840
It seems now that we're trying out different variations,

303
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,240
Medium

304
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:26,080
The end is near right?

305
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,460
What does Broccoli have in it? Vitamins? Was it Iron?

306
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,580
Vitamin C...

307
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,630
Broccoli is rich in Vitamin C

308
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,330
And Iron!

309
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,070
So annoying, right?

310
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,720
Broccoli is defintely rich in Iron!

311
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:49,900
They say Broccoli has 5 times more iron than nails

312
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,800
The first tenderloin steak today, they will enjoy it rare at Shimbashi store

313
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,600
With less fat, the flavour comes from the lean meat

314
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,710
The potatoes are chosen for the side

315
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,600
Oooo yeea

316
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,400
Amazing!

317
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,440
The fattyness is so different

318
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,780
You're right

319
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,580
First time today, Filet

320
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,250
How is it?

321
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,480
It would be a shame if it was firm

322
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:30,500
Rare is the best after all

323
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,500
You like rare now

324
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:35,980
I wish we could undo the well done back then

325
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,450
The potato is tasty too

326
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,450
Is it good?

327
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:45,320
We didn't really need to try the potato though...

328
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,920
The ingen instead?

329
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,920
For this episode

330
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,990
For now, by yourself,

331
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,940
We shall see the overture soon (TN: Not sure about this one)

332
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,180
Isn't the pace increasing?

333
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,840
Finished, congratulations!

334
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,500
Choosing steaks for the 7th store

335
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,260
But,

336
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,160
Middle rib.

337
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,820
Middle rib?

338
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,740
The one from the first store

339
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,640
The very first one

340
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,400
Tanaka says he wants some red wine

341
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,000
Red wine at his point...
Please, it's a bit...

342
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,630
Shall we order it?

343
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,170
No no, it's OK

344
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,270
We'll decide when we get there

345
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:42,490
Order it, order it now, now do it do it

346
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,440
My stomach is,

347
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,440
totally fine still

348
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,800
That's true

349
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:56,000
If 10 is the max, what number are you?

350
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:59,590
Matsumoto-san, how much for you?

351
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,590
For me it's pretty much,

352
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,830
Pretty much zero I guess

353
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:05,930
Like you haven't started

354
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,930
Like I haven't started

355
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,040
Hosei-san?

356
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,570
I'm For Realz 6

357
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,570
For Realz 6?

358
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:15,760
After 5 more stores, I might just die

359
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,760
Ikinari Steak Marathon; Store #7 is here in Minato Ward, Akasaka-Dori store

360
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,480
You had the wine?

361
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,000
The forcefully ordered wine reaches Tanaka

362
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,400
I can feel it already?

363
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,870
Already? You only licked it

364
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:44,300
Honestly though, why don't we all take sips from this?

365
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,820
The fragrance is amazing

366
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,050
This is too staged

367
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,700
Is that so? I see

368
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:07,300
This time, it;s the middle rib steak again

369
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,440
But still,

370
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,000
It doesn't look unappealing at all

371
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,300
The red wine will go with it

372
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,000
That's true

373
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,260
Tanaka is a red wine kinda guy too

374
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,060
Need to think about the balance

375
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,260
You sure love corn

376
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:36,790
You can grill your lips on the grill if you want to

377
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,640
I think this tenderloin is good

378
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,540
Tenderloin is best?

379
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,540
The filet or the sirloin

380
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,820
I like this taste

381
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:54,770
If you'd like, just take a sip, just a sip

382
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:05,220
Corn and red wine go together, right?

383
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,890
I've never heard of that before

384
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,330
You've got a weird vibe, all by yourself with that wine

385
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,100
It's all your fault though

386
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,100
I just wanted to share the red wine

387
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,100
I just don't want you guys to miss out, on this fine drink

388
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,600
Finished!

389
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,340
Fantastic

390
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,910
8th store now

391
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:41,600
3 hours since the start, they've eaten 280g each
Do they still find it easy?

392
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,830
They answer that question with their body language

393
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,840
You're rubbing your stomach

394
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,140
It's my habit

395
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,280
Did you always have that habit?

396
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,480
It doesn't matter if you're full

397
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,780
It just matters that you keep eating

398
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,920
So it's alright to say you feel full

399
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:11,000
That's true right?
There's no need to lie and pretend otherwise

400
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,940
This guy said he was at 0!

401
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,160
We can all eat together,

402
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,550
we just need one person to eat at each store

403
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:25,520
Do you think it's okay to encourage gorging on all this meat?

404
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,540
An old man eating meat by himself won't get laid

405
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:34,680
So 5 old men eating meat won't get laid either

406
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,460
NEXT WEEK! The marathon continues

407
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,600
Many events occurr!

408
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,290
Store person!

409
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:53,000
They reach the limits of the stomach

410
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:59,480
There's a time limit to consider too
From where I'm standing, that just looks like a cow

411
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:09,640
Hosei-san, are you ok?
