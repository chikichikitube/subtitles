1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:02,150
Tonight is...

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,620
Even if locked up

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,070
If you can get the "Lucky Item of the Day

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:12,920
You'll be able to escape - 1 hour SP

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,900
Trapped in a small, isolated house in the snowy plains of Nagano Prefecture

6
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,850
Patapatamama

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,570
Need two keys to escape from here

8
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,370
One hung from a ceiling 4.5 meters high

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,400
The other is tied around the neck of a rat indoors

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,270
History Books
-History books?

11
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,120
This is no use for escaping

12
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:50,150
In addition to whether the two can make full use of the lucky items that appear in TV horoscopes

13
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,220
To obtain two keys

14
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,350
And escape from this room

15
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:58,820
What about their final return to Tokyo?

16
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,920
So, hello again everyone

17
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,050
Same as last week, its Nanamagari

18
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,720
Thank you

19
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,000
Looking forward to the rest of it

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,520
This week's episode follows last week's episode

21
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,700
The first day's lucky items have been delivered, what do you think?

22
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,180
That's really...
-All useless

23
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,870
That history book is too thin, right?

24
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:44,600
If they get more then they may be able to get the key

25
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,950
More of the world's greats, indeed

26
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,320
That history book is too thin.
-That's true

27
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,200
Sweater could be slightly useful

28
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,920
But they probably don't even know the sweater will come in handy

29
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,700
Yeah, they both don't know what's going on out there yet

30
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,400
If they don't know, maybe they'll sell the sweater

31
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,100
They even said it was hot in the room

32
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,770
If they don't get enough items, it is impossible to escape, right?

33
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,270
Its like Abashiri Prison

34
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,270
※1965 Japanese film set in Tsunago Prison, the most famous prison for felons in Japan

35
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,210
Its jailbreak level

36
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,700
So, please continue to watch

37
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,570
Day 1

38
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,770
They received the lucky items of the day

39
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,900
And learned about the cash exchange system

40
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,700
They will sell them all, right?

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,030
Anyway, let's sell this first

42
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,570
It's warm in the room. You don't need it at all, right?

43
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,740
No need. It's warm inside

44
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:48,470
The two also have no way of knowing the weather conditions outside the room

45
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,470
Do you really want to sell?

46
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,670
So, they sold the important sweaters and history books

47
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,620
They can get a bit of money

48
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,450
Total 5,000 yen

49
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,860
Great!

50
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,520
It's good, 5000

51
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,590
This store's conscience...

52
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,460
We've got 5,000, right?

53
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,530
Hurry up and buy something!

54
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,030
"Lucky Chance, Small" Buy it?

55
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,130
I kind of want toilet paper

56
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:11,900
Wow... that's an amazing price!

57
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,200
After a long time of deliberation, the two purchased...

58
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,720
Sure enough, the same as you two

59
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,270
They both smoke

60
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:29,620
Balance

61
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:29,620
Cigarettes (one box)

62
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:29,620
Lighter

63
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:29,620
Toilet paper

64
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:29,620
m 0 0 l 274 0 274 60 0 60

65
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:29,620
m 0 0 l 274 0 274 60 0 60

66
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:29,620
m 0 0 l 274 0 274 60 0 60

67
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,900
Ah, they bought a box

68
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,620
Really addicted

69
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,670
In addition, they get dinner

70
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:39,300
Based on the horoscope ranking of TBS "HAYADOKI!

71
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,720
So, third place on that day, Aquarius, Shimabata, had sushi for dinner

72
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,750
Tenth place, Virgo, Kinoshita's dinner was rice balls

73
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,940
So delicious!

74
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,910
Are the rice balls good?
-Mmm

75
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,050
This sushi is also very delicious!

76
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,220
Afterwards

77
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,580
Just jump up

78
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,020
Can't reach it!

79
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:06,420
Ah, it's in

80
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,300
Ah no no no no

81
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,360
Ah! It hurts!

82
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,200
It's in!

83
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,100
The key is control

84
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:21,370
Rose  Fragrance

85
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,370
Ah, I hit it! I hit it!

86
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:21,370
Yes, you can

87
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,110
Its so steady!

88
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,780
Seems to be connected

89
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:33,470
They must reach the first key at a height of 4.5 meters with their hands

90
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:41,490
And the second key stays in the nest and doesn't come out at all

91
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,160
Give it a name?

92
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,960
What is the best name?

93
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,560
Since it has the key hanging

94
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,170
Call it "Nanking", right?

95
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,170
※In Japanese, "padlocks" are called "Nanking lozenges" from the Edo period, when it was customary to call exotic and small objects "Nanking".

96
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,270
"Nanking"

97
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,900
"Nanking"

98
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,720
It's not a pumpkin

99
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,720
※"Pumpkin" is also known as "Nanking" in Japanese, and by the way, potatoes are also known as "Nanking taro" in Japanese, and groundnuts are also known as "Nanking beans"

100
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,470
Nan, come here

101
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,210
Nan is very cute

102
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,310
You just said it was disgusting

103
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,640
I'm used to seeing it now

104
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,380
Just an ordinary rat

105
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,350
Not a hamster or something like that

106
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:07,720
In the midst of their prayers for Nan to come out soon

107
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,750
The first day ends

108
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,100
It's so long!

109
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,300
Day 2

110
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,300
Here it comes, here it comes, the golden slot

111
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,360
"HAYADOKI!" is almost ready to start!

112
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,200
They can already get up on time!

113
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,700
Model prisoners

114
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,930
This is the most important part of our day

115
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,140
Get a "ladder"!

116
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,000
Ladder...

117
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,610
Here comes the lazy egg horoscope

118
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,840
Bad morning

119
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,070
Ladder probably wont come up

120
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:33,550
The best luck on this day of the holiday is...

121
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,480
Please

122
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,010
Come on come on

123
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,250
Scorpio

124
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,850
Ah, Scorpio first

125
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,420
Scorpio ah...

126
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
Wow, that's dangerous

127
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,360
Wow, not at all

128
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,550
The lucky thing is the picture at the top of the mountain

129
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,620
Luckily not the first

130
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,230
After that, they will all come out at once

131
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,000
Virgo second

132
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,730
Lunch box?

133
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,040
Lunch box...

134
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,520
Down undershirt, sheet music, balloons, couples things...

135
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:07,450

141
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,370
Ah, ninth place

142
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,380
Ninth place - hat

143
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,450
Hat...

144
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,450
Hat?

145
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,300
You should keep your hat. It's cold

146
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,300
Next, Asahi TV's Good Morning!

Why is there a balcony?

181
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,430
Don't need it

182
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,060
None are needed

183
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,070
Today's are so weak

184
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,700
So busy just at this moment in the day

Good

220
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,180
Wow, Aries is a toothbrush

221
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,800
Maybe you can straighten it to get the keys

222
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,450
Oh yeah

223
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:44,680
Toothbrush... so jealous

224
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,070
I see

225
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:51,160

231
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,870
Today they got 6 items

232
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,020
Later

233
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,760
The recliner is very high class

234
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,370
This feels useful, right?

235
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,370
Yeah

236
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,620
The two have finally obtained some bigger items

237
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,700
And thus begin looking forward to the possibility of getting the far-off key

238
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,650
Still too low, right?

239
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:06,650
It won't work

240
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,950
It's breaking down, it's breaking down, it's breaking down

241
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,340
You hold the top

242
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,200
It's dangerous.
-Looks like it'll break

243
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,770
It will definitely happen!

244
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,280
Whoa whoa whoa

245
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,570
Yeah, for sure

246
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,880
Ah, it hurts...

247
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,890
It was hard to climb here, but now it's so easy

248
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,870
No way

249
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,760
Ah, I feel like I can reach it

250
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,500
Ah, not enough at all

251
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,170
If you could climb up, you could reach it

252
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,200
Can't climb that high yet

253
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,550
After the two people realize how far they are from getting the key

254
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,900
Smoking again

255
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,410
This shot is very unattractive

256
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:50,750
Balance

257
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:50,750

00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:50,750

260
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:50,750

264
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:50,750
m 0 0 l 413 0 413 47 0 47

265
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,580
Where can you go in five hours?

266
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,540
Its really like a bathhouse

267
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,680
Should be able to pass Nagoya, right?

268
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,850
Through Nagoya?
-Yes

269
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,750
Then go to Tomei

270
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,950
It is in Mie?

271
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:56,050
I have no sense of direction, I don't know...

272
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,650
Five hours indeed

273
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,790
Maybe Lake Biwa?

274
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,000
Shiga Prefecture

275
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,290
I see

276
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,990
It may really be Lake Biwa

277
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:09,270
Once they leave the room, they will face other problems

278
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,700
What the hell are they going to do?

279
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:15,420
Anyway, the 3rd day begins

280
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,320
What will they do?

281
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,070
Seems like they'll never escape

282
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:21,250
Café

283
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:21,250
Food bags

284
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:21,250
Sweet Wine

285
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:21,250
Veg Juice

286
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:21,250
The lucky items for both of them today are the above four

287
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,400
5th place

288
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:29,090
Athlete's picture

289
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:29,090
Desk

290
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:29,090
Earmuffs

291
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:29,090
Sneakers

292
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:29,090
Suits

293
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,500
Sneakers and desk

294
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,520
Desk

295
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,120
Desk might be enough to reach

296
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,800
Desk?

297
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,870
Not bad!

298
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,470
This is very important

299
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,690
The desk is great!

300
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,990
This may be enough

301
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:43,900
Not available

302
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:43,900
Coffee shop

303
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:43,900
Desk

304
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:43,900
Sneakers

305
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:43,900
Sweet Wine

306
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:43,900
Vegetable Juice

307
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,970
They acquired sneakers that they'll unfortunately need after leaving the room

308
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,100
Sneakers absolutely needed

309
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:41,620
And a table that they hope can be used to reach the key

310
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,320
After all, they don't have shoes

311
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,900
The horde for the 3rd day

312
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:48,400
However, Nan remains in the nest

313
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,670
But will they be able to use the table to get the first key?

314
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,670
Is the height enough?

315
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,280
The table legs are so thin
-Unexpectedly

316
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,350
Upright on top of this should still be safe, right?

317
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,150
Feel much closer!

318
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,870
Is it close?

319
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,790
It's close!

320
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,750
Seems a bit far still

321
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,390
Is it enough to add this?

322
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,070
Really?

323
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,730
This is really enough

324
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,720
Be careful. Be careful

325
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,260
Good

326
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,870
Ah this really can really work

327
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,750
Stacked?

328
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,050
Exactly...

329
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,350
Be careful!

330
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:19,550
What is this?

331
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,850
Come on!

332
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,450
Eh? Seems possible

333
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,580
Please.
-Oi!

334
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,610
Did you get it?

335
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,050
Ah

336
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,850
Please!

337
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,320
Eh, what's wrong?

338
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,750
40cm away

339
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,720
Not even close

340
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,750
Out of reach...

341
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,190
Damn

342
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,290
Gimme a break!

343
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,990
Day 4

344
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:46,950
Same as before, on the 4th morning

345
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,800
Totally old men!

346
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,050
What was delivered to the two today was

347
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:03,850
Artificial fur coat

348
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:09,100
All are needed after leaving the room

349
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,720
This is very necessary

350
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,170
They only have tops

351
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,790
But...

352
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,650
What is artificial fur?

353
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,220
It's almost spring!

354
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,730
There is no need for this kind of jacket!

355
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,930
You need it!

356
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,330
This is not necessary

357
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,970
Even after escaping

358
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,970
Need it!

359
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:28,120
The two people, completely unaware of the situation outside, immediately sold the warm clothes

360
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,050
Ah, they sold it

361
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,600
And

362
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:40,180
Doorbell

363
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,480
This sound will definitely stay in our memories

364
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,110
It will be when we open it, right?
-Exactly

365
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,110
This is the last thing you need, right?

366
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,050
This will become our goal

367
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,180
Ok

00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:48,530

388
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:47,720
They finally purchased the long-awaited lucky item - small

389
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:51,570
Its content is

390
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,550
Here we go

391
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,420
5000 yen

392
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,370
Hey wait a minute, this is completely useless

393
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,300
What is it?

394
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,370
Magazine

395
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,480
This magazine is for us to pass the time?

396
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,970
These are the five magazines that were delivered

397
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,480
And

398
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:18,790
Please choose a favorite magazine and you can get the lucky items in the magazine

399
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,590
Oh

400
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,590
I see

401
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:24,460
Most of the lucky items in this book are female items

402
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,630
If its cosmetics and so on then we're done for

403
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,670
It's true

404
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:32,850
So, the magazine they chose was

405
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,220
We chose "The Television"

406
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,220
So

407
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,320
Winning and losing at once

408
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,180
It's coming. It's coming

409
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,420
High cocoa chocolate

410
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,500
Full Body Mirror

411
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,320
Full body mirror is that...

412
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,650
Can this be used?

413
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,030
Show me too

414
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,770
Wow, I have grown a lot of beard

415
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:15,150

It doesn't matter, right?

419
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,620
Using it like that?

420
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,070
Clamp it

421
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,240
Can you pull it?

422
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,810
No...

423
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,380
Can't pull it?

424
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,150
Completely ungraspable

425
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:22,920
Being locked up for 20 days a month and playing at the theater for 10 days

426
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,260
Seems pretty good

427
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,790
No way... they are broken

428
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,320
By now, the two have gotten used to the situation

429
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:39,800
And have even begun to enjoy this life without freedom where they don't have consider their livelihoods

430
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:39,800
They're having fun!

431
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,570
Indeed

432
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,770
It's out!

433
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,400
Nan

434
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,470
Nan is out

435
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,720
It's out. So cute

436
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,000
Hey!

437
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,800
Hey, Shimo

438
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,250
Ah, its moving

439
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:15,110
Day 5

440
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,050
What was that just now?

441
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,340
I feel like I can buy a winner

442
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,380

00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:25,820
Today, they sold a high-priced e-reader item straight away

456
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:30,150
And bought a lucky chance item for the second day in a row

457
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,020
Finally, this'll be a winner

458
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,230
That's three times the price of Lucky Chance Small

459
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:39,660
It costs 15,000 yen so it should be useful

460
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,030
They are trying to convince themselves

461
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,030
15,000 yen is expensive

462
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,020
The contents of the lucky chance is...

463
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,020
What is it?

464
00:13:47,300 --> 00:14:05,690
The lucky chance
allows one to select a
specific horoscope for the next day
to get the selected items for that sign

465
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,800
This is also by luck

466
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,790
So that's our Aquarius, Virgo, and one more

467
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,290
This is awesome!

468
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:14,400
So, the two people use the cards they got to randomly select a constellation

469
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,300
They also have playing cards

470
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,270
This is the one to choose

471
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:20,950
① Aries

472
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,170
Will this choice be bad or good?

473
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:36,520

They're having a good time!

477
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,520
You have a flush!
-Flush

478
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,690
Even the hair on my ass is being plucked

479
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,950
They were gambling cigarettes

480
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,530
Thank you!

481
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,790
I've run out of cigarettes

482
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,790
That's not good

483
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,520
No way!

484
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,730
I was set up!

485
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,430
So crafty, you cheat!

486
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,500
This is prison, right?

487
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,700
Showa-era prison

489
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,410
Can it been done today?

490
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,180
Aries is also counted

491
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,780
Yeah

492
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,580

Although they are pinning their hopes on yesterday's purchase

496
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,030
Here, something unexpected happens

497
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,080
What's going on?

498
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,460
No "HAYADOKI!

499
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,770
Ah, yes, because it's Saturday

500
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:23,290
Not on at the weekend

501
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:23,230
No "HAYADOKI!" on Saturday!

502
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,740
Playing something like a music program

503
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,810
No other programs on?

504
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,240
Indeed, it was a Saturday

505
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,240
So that's what happened

506
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,030
Thus, they realize the horoscope segment is only broadcast on weekdays

507
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:31,890
What about the others?

508
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,470
It is not on at the weekend

509
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:40,250
Once again, the search was extended to all TV stations

510
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,250
It's gotta be done

511
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,030
The first weekend

512
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,090
Oh, isn't this one?

513
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,090
It's "ZOOM SAT"!

514
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,040
Seems right

515
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,860
It's "ZOOM SAT"!

516
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,860
It should have a horoscope segment, right?

517
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,320
Ah, there it is

518
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:49,540
I think there is

519
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,560
It's there!

520
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,300
Aries

521
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,940
Ah, but it does not seem to say lucky items

522
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,100
What is this?

523
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,540
Aries, ah No. 10!

524
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,840
Ah, but... there's nothing

525
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,240
No mention of lucky items

526
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,710
No lucky items?

527
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,780
Ah, its here coming!

528
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,710
It says, "Don't be too greedy now!

529
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,650
The irony... so ironic

530
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,200
Next: On Fuji TV

531
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,820
Okay, come on

532
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,890
Ah, here we go

533
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,090
Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go.
-Okay, okay

534
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,960
Aries is also useful

535
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,710
Virgo is the third
-Virgo is the third and then...

536
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,050
Jogging?

537
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,750
Aquarius, surprisingly, is a soba restaurant

538
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,060
One by one, all useless

539
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:40,740
So, the item from the lucky chance for Aries is...

540
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,410
Come on, come on!

541
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,410
What's this?

542
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,310
Wow what is this?

543
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,020
Lucky person!?

544
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,150
What the hell is "People who wear light clothes even in winter"?

545
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,060
This isn't us!

546
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,820
Unfortunately, their luck failed to materialize

547
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,610
Why did you choose Aries?
-What a waste

548
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,060
Cheated!

549
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,970
The staff knew that there was no horoscopes on Saturday, right?

550
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,970
They must know it!

551
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:07,870
There is no concern for the mood of those who are locked up

552
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:10,340
Because they've never experienced it

553
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,240
They've only ever imprisoned others

554
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:15,310
I'll complain to Downtown

555
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,730
You two are so annoying

556
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:18,180
The two of them must be laughing at us together with the staff

557
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,450
They're just a gang, or rather, the bosses of the gang

558
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,790
Getting ruder and ruder

559
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:28,680
And then, all they have to look forward to is dinner

560
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,130
Dinner

561
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,130
Ice Cream

562
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,130
Pizza

563
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,130
m 0 0 l 1310 0 1310 485 0 485

564
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:33,390
There is no dinner because there is no "HAYADOKI!

565
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,400
Too cruel, right?

566
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,800
Ahhhh

567
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,130
Adding fuel to the fire

568
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,270
How could you do such a thing?

569
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,560
Looks like an old man

570
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,630
An old man who fainted from the heat in the bathhouse

571
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,440
Oh

572
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,050
Lucky Item Escape Life

573
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:51,860
Not only that, but their misfortune continued on Sunday as well

574
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:56,520
Sunday there are no horoscopes
-None

575
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,260
Not a single one!

576
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,620
Nothing can be done about that

577
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,390
So none of them on the weekend

578
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,700
That's it. No new items, no dinner

579
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,240
The duo had a hell of a weekend

580
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,900
This is too tough

581
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,430
Only sleep

582
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,380
Whoa, this could really work!

583
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,500
This TV show is unbelievable

584
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:27,320
Lucky Item Escape Life

585
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,680
The duo who had a weekend with nothing to do

586
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,520
At this rate

587
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,060
Simply waiting for time to pass also feels a little redundant

588
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,200
The only thing we can do now is to catch Nan

589
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,530
Nan, right?

590
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,990
Indeed, there is a key

591
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:46,490
So, they spend their free time to seriously capture Nan

592
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,480
I think the cheese method is still the best
-After all, they like cheese the most

593
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,610
Just try putting cheese?
-Try to place it in a row

594
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,010
They purchased the cheese on the item list

595
00:18:54,950 --> 00:19:03,190
Cheese

596
00:18:54,950 --> 00:19:03,190
m 0 0 l 1310 0 1310 485 0 485

597
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,690
Bought

598
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:01,650
Then broke it up into small pieces to try and lure the rat out

599
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,290
And then Immediately

600
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,990
Here we go, here we go

601
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,460
Really will eat the cheese

602
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,020
Nan is reacting

603
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,000
So cute

604
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,460
And really likes cheese

605
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,370
Close the distance, hold your breath

606
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,920
Getting ready with the book

607
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,680
It would be better to put it out again, right?

608
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,160
Then step forward with your right foot

609
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,740
Make sure you use a capture method that can be broadcast on TV

610
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,910
It feels like it knows
-It's gone

611
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,680
It knows

612
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,520
But cheese works!

613
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:50,270
That's it. The two of them continue to hold their breath

614
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:53,240
Trying to become part of room, and three hours have passed

615
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,170
This is too much to bear

616
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,270
At this time, the opportunity came once again

617
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,380
Nan must be hungry

618
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:13,530
Don't rush

619
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,040
Don't rush

620
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,920
It's out!

621
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,110
Nan

622
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,330
It should also be a bit more familiar now

623
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:26,490
Not yet

624
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,680
Just want the key

625
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,870
It's out, right? It should be out already

626
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,910
Now now now
-Go go

627
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,530
Hurry up!

628
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,640
Great! Great!

629
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,030
Hurry up and block it

630
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,180
Great! Great!

631
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,530
Well, well, well, this should be the best thing to do

632
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,600
After a week, they finally succeeded in blocking the exit of the cage

633
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,230
They have almost captured Nan

634
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,110
So

635
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:09,280
Should be able to just pick it up directly

636
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,610
Friendly!

637
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,480
Should be able to pick it up directly

638
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,240
Well, it works. It works

639
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,440
Just get the key

640
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,250
Be gentle

641
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,420
Be gentle

642
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,550
Great! Great!

643
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,070
Oh, nice!

644
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:19,880
Take it off

645
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,290
Got it!

646
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,170
Great! Great!

647
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,210
Nanjou is also quite happy, right?

648
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,730
Finally got it!

649
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,600
Finally got the first key!

650
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,400
This guy is already married

651
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,940
Other sorrows have arisen...

652
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:38,940
Lets use this key to open the first lock

653
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,680
It took a whole week!

654
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,410
It's in, isn't it? It's in.
-It's in

655
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,150
Its going

656
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:46,820
Ok

657
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,550
It's open!

658
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,900
Great! We did it!

659
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,360
So happy!

660
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,630
Great!

661
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,000
The only one left is this guy!

662
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,740
All that's left is this guy.
-Wait for me

663
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:11,080
Making progress ups the confidence

664
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,180
Finally got one!

665
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,630
It's been a week since they started, and they've finally made substantial progress

666
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,850
Married!

667
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,060
What awaits the hopeful pair?

668
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,420
Is it simply...

669
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,320
Despair?

670
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,530
Really the middle of nowhere

671
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,260
Infinite snow

672
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,470
Still so far

673
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,470
Finally got a key

674
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:42,870
The real problem comes after getting the key
-That's true

675
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,980
Opening the door is just the beginning
-It does start there

676
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:49,300
We were out in five days, and they've been in there for a week.
-Yeah

677
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:55,190
Since we had a task it felt like we had something to do

678
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:58,560
But the part of us finally being free was all cut

679
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,610
It was very tough

680
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:05,430
They didn't sell the cards and other stuff so they had something to pass the time

681
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,900
It's been a long time since I heard on TV that "even the hair on my ass is being plucked"

682
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:17,710
Lucky Item Escape Life

683
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:16,490
On the day when the mandatory house life entered its second week

684
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:22,160
"Today's Lucky Item" will make waves

685
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,900
Really?

686
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,280
Come on, please

687
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,120
Looks like Izumiya

688
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,570
Quite similar

689
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,400
Izumiya

690
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,160
Ok

691
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:32,850
It's here, Monday!

692
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:37,570
The lucky items appearing after three days causes the duo to applaud

693
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:50,170
Books

694
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:50,170
Brooches

695
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:50,170
Food Site

696
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:50,170
Notepad

697
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:42,370
The lucky items for each TV station were as follows

698
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:47,860
Among them, the most lucky item from Fuji TV is...

699
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,840
The lucky items given were

700
00:23:50,170 --> 00:24:12,130
Aquarius

701
00:23:50,170 --> 00:24:12,130
m 0 0 l 0 343 l 370 343 l 370 0

702
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:54,140
Is this...

703
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:54,620
What is it?

704
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,290
Wow, we got it!

705
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,420
Key!
-For what?

706
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:03,790
It says "TOYOTA" on it

707
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:08,390
Isn't this the key to the mobile vending cart?

708
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:03,990
Vending Cart

709
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:03,990
m 0 0 l 0 343 l 370 343 l 370 0

710
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,500
Is it a car?

711
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,020
Vending Cart

712
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,020
m 0 0 l 0 343 l 370 343 l 370 0

713
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,050
Vending Cart

714
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,050
m 0 0 l 0 343 l 370 343 l 370 0

715
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:12,130
Vending Cart

716
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:12,130
m 0 0 l 0 343 l 370 343 l 370 0

717
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,490
Isn't it great?

718
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,760
A lie, right?

719
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,130
Can drive back in a car?

720
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:15,230
Does that mean it's already here? The mobile vending cart?

721
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,400
I think it's already here

722
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:24,140
The two of them expected that the mobile vending cart of lucky items would be parked on the other side of the door like a miracle

723
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,690
Awesome

724
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:25,690
However

725
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:31,070
Because of the snow, it was not possible to drive it to the door

726
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,070
Ah, I see, I see

727
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,980
It's stopped there!

728
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:39,250
It was parked about 300 meters away from the snowfield

729
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,590
Going back to Tokyo in this?

730
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,690
Isn't this a jailbreak?

731
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,060
Do they do stuff like this on TV?

732
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,630
It's really a miracle

733
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:51,870
This TV show is unbelievable, right?

734
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,140
So

735
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:59,410
Lucky Chance

736
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:59,410
m 0 0 l 498 0 498 167.5 0 167.5

737
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,790
A big chance

738
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:58,660
Going for the big one?

739
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,610
Try to save up 30,000 yen

740
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,410
Must endure

741
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:03,120
The duo has immediately gained realistic confidence in reaching their goals

742
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,630
We also feel relieved

743
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:06,700
A one-two punch approach

744
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:14,320
Lucky Item Escape Life

745
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,530
So good luck brings good luck

746
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:14,020
Once again, they acquired unimaginable items

747
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,900
Coming

748
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:19,350
It's quite pleasing. Hopefully it will be done this week

749
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:26,070
Aquarius

750
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:21,270
The best luck today is

751
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,360
First...

752
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:26,950
Here we go

753
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,440
Oh, number one. Great

754
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,840
The first time the first

755
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,310
Big Tree
-It's a big tree!

756
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,050
A big tree?
-Isn't that good?

757
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,810
Surprisingly, they've bagged a big tree

758
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,340
Surprisingly, a big tree

759
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,150
Wait!

760
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,580
Oh, here it is

761
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,240
A big tree

762
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:46,110
Ah, a tree

763
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:45,670
A tree!

764
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:48,130
The big tree has arrived

765
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,000
Its a big tree

766
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:52,660
If we put it under here and stand on it

767
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,140
It's awesome

768
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,770
It should work just fine

769
00:25:55,770 --> 00:26:01,940
On this day, they also received something useful for the cold

770
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:06,110
Big Tree

771
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:06,110
Jacket

772
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:06,110
Weather Forecast

773
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:00,180
That's important too!

774
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:06,110
Its the luckiest day since the beginning

775
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:09,290
Meanwhile, Virgo gets...

776
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,490
T-point card

777
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,350
Spring Tune

778
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:16,320
Grape Juice

779
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:16,320
Reward Card

780
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:16,320
Spring Songs

781
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,650
Yumi Matsutani: "Spring is coming"

782
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:16,310
Nostalgic. It's a CD single

783
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:23,090
So, they tried to use a large tree with a length of 3.5 meters and a weight of 150 kg

784
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,350
Incredible

785
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,740
150kg

786
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:25,720
They initiate an attempt to retrieve the key

787
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,930
Ok, on two

788
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:30,820
Don't get hurt!

789
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,840
Heavy, right?
-It's heavy.

790
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,040
I'll lift it
-I'll push

791
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,880
Just a little bit, just wait a little bit

792
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,480
Put it back first, put it back, put it back
-Put it back, put it back, put it back

793
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,000
Looks dangerous

794
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:49,520
It's tough to get it up

795
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,540
I see, it's because it's too long

796
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,220
It's too heavy

797
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,100
Is it not good to lean?

798
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:57,450
So, they fought with this big, heavy tree for an hour

799
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,710
Yeah need some support

800
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:08,940
Table

801
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:15,910
3rd Day Item

802
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:15,910
m 0 0 l 0 343 l 370 343 l 370 0

803
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:03,100
Using the lucky item desk they got at the beginning

804
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,910
They were able to put the tree against the wall

805
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,980
Even so, can you get it?

806
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,940
It's up?

807
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:15,910
Sneakers

808
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:15,910
Will the two be able get the final key and escape?

809
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:11,730
Wearing shoes now

810
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,690
Can they climb up?

811
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:18,350
Grandpa

812
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,620
Encouraging an old grandpa

813
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,240
Okay, wait a minute

814
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:29,190
Be careful, looks scary

815
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,930
It feels good.
-I'm holding it still

816
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,060
It won't suddenly fall, right?

817
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,770
From the top

818
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,200
Because it's a big tree

819
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:33,860
Lean on the side first

820
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,470
Ok ok ok

821
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,300
Impressive

822
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:41,510
Should be able to get it now

823
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:41,580
Go for it!

824
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:44,070
Be careful! Be careful!

825
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:44,680
Be careful indeed!

826
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,510
Wow, this is really a bit slippery

827
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,410
There is no place to hold on to

828
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,560
True

829
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:51,920
What about the wall?
-I can't reach it with my hands

830
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,650
Just a little further

831
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,850
Need to climb a little higher

832
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,700
One more step up

833
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,050
I'll go up a bit more

834
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,390
I'm up i'm up

835
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,320
Shouldn't be a problem

836
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:01,990
I'm up!
-At the top!

837
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,890
Looks scary

838
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,410
It should work. It should work

839
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:06,650
Like watching a documentary about escaping from prison

840
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,800
No way!

841
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,530
Oh, he can reach it

842
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:13,420
Finally, the moment has come

843
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,970
Okay, its possible
-Did you get it?

844
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,080
Great!

845
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,350
Got it! Got it!

846
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,220
Great!

847
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:31,190
After 215 hours they finally got the key

848
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:32,800
Great. Got it before the weekend

849
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:35,390
And then, the moment they'd been looking forward to for 9 days finally came

850
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,060
Let's open it!

851
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,260
But they both still think this is the end

852
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,440
What kind of expression will there be?

853
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:46,400
It should be ok

854
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,640
The time has finally come for the escape bell to ring

855
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,090
Indeed

856
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:50,410
Great!

857
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,620
They thought this'd be the end

858
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,660
Let's open it together

859
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,190
Its just the starting bell

860
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,520
Ok, one, two

861
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:58,920
The time has finally come for the escape bell to ring

862
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,680
Great!

863
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,930
Let's open it together

864
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,720
Ok. One, two

865
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,960
Great!

866
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,630
What is this?

867
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:13,100
One-two, great!

868
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,700
Thought the staff was already waiting outside

869
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:16,490
One-two, great!

870
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,070
Still one step behind

871
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,100
What is this?

872
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,540
Eh, wait

873
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,410
What is this?

874
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,890
Playing DEPARTURES

875
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,040
Isn't this all snow?

876
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,250
Wow, it's cold!

877
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,180
My breath is white!

878
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,790
Close the door quickly

879
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,820
Where is this place?

880
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,160
Season 2 has started

881
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:37,150
Wait a second
-An endless field of snow!

882
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,390
Eh, where is this?

883
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,730
Isn't it spring already?

884
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:46,260
I don't even have shoes

885
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:45,780
Barefoot

886
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,830
Ah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm wearing it

887
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,510
These are the comments of people just released from prison

888
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:50,170
Go in first, go in first

889
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,590
Went back

890
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:51,400
Wear the jacket?

891
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,070
Indeed, it's great to have a jacket

892
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:52,980
Getting equipped

893
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,440
What have you done? What the hell is this?

894
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,210
What's going on here?

895
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,940
Hey, what's with the snow?

896
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,240
Also using a drone like thing to shoot!?

897
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,150
What the hell is going on here?

898
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,180
Barefoot!

899
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:06,380
Can someone please come out?

900
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,750
Where is the mobile vending cart?

901
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,420
We're not being lied to, are we?
-Fooled?

902
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,660
We can't escape yet

903
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,160
Failed escape?

904
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,490
Because of the snow

905
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,380
Snow everywhere

906
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,970
This is impossible

907
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,240
Can't walk barefoot!

908
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,840
Really can't, barefoot

909
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:33,910
What should we do?

910
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,750
Throwing a tantrum now

911
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,270
Don't want to see this

912
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:44,460
The chair is taking a beating

913
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,530
Broken heart

914
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:50,640
What happened?

915
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,310
Thought it was the end

916
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:58,030
We can only be on TV if we have to go through this?

917
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:02,110
We really can't be on TV unless we're being punished huh?

918
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:05,410
Both crying

919
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:06,900
Wedding ring...

920
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,580
What the heck

921
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,180
His words are a little hard to top

922
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:15,950
Why do we have to go to such lengths to be on TV

923
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:19,560
I've never seen him in such a state before

924
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,600
He went berserk

925
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,930
Crazy!

926
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:23,180
Punched the chair

927
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:26,700
He hit the hinge part

928
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,670
Really pissed off

929
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:31,070
They are so desperate to get home

930
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,200
The expression of joy after opening the door

931
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,170
Ok, open!

932
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,670
He's half a beat late

933
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:37,870
The momentary freeze is the most real response

934
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,240
Frozen in place

935
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,670
What do you think so far?

936
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:43,070
I think, if they stay one more day

937
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,180
Get some more lucky items

938
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:48,450
And go back in the car with no problem

939
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,050
But I just don't know if their mental state can still hold up

940
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:54,420
But even after working so hard to get back to Yoshimoto headquarters

941
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,860
They don't have any more work

942
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,650
Just back to the real world

943
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:03,100
Lucky Item Escape Life

944
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:05,940
Spending the night in despair

945
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,940
Only departure remains

946
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:10,820
It is impossible to escape without cold clothing and shoes

947
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,970
That's true. That's true

948
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,980
Today's lucky items are

949
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,340
In the beginning, they won a lot of prizes!

950
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:24,190

955
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,930
Items such as headphones and flower-shaped molds

956
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:22,450
Nothing useful for protection against the cold

957
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,440
Yoga?
-Poached eggs...

958
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,880
At this time

959
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,670
Although we don't know what it is

960
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:29,330
You can only bet on a good chance of luck, right?

961
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:28,640
Saving money is better

962
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:31,740
I hope we can get winter clothes from here

963
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,840
Right?

00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,910
In this way, they place everything on the lucky chance items

990
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:39,290
So far, including the items exchanged

991
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,290
No need indeed

992
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:44,040
They sold everything but the sneakers, jacket, and doorbell

993
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,250
Sell the doorbell

994
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:49,510

1000
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:03,650
Their hopes are high for the lucky chance

1001
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,650
What's inside?

1002
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,330
What exactly is it?

1003
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,770

1004
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,740
Lucky chance is big

1005
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:21,280
Choose any one program tomorrow
and get the full horoscope lucky items

1006

Get it all
-12 of them

1007

Oh, so that's it!

1008
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,040
It's a big opportunity indeed

1009
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:27,780
In other words, we must wait for tomorrow's show

1010
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,210
Just like that, the possibility of escaping today is reduced to a wisp of smoke

1011
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,570
Which program will they watch?

1012

1013
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,160
Day 11 is upon us

1014
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:44,210
The two put their money on Asahi TV's Good Morning!

1015
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:47,440
This time we can get 12 in one go.
-Great chance of luck

1016
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,170
Get all 12

1017
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:49,810
Great! Get all of them!

1018
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,910

1044
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:01,840
Successfully got a jacket

1045
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:07,120

Actually, it's a Virgo lucky item that Kinoshita would have gotten anyway

1051
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,680
Anyway, they finally got the clothes they have been waiting for

1052
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,300
Haunted by sadness

1053
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,250
The duo begin to see the hope of a successful escape

1054
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,210
Great!

1055
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:24,980
They then confirmed the situation outside of the house during the day

1056
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,080
So

1057
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,410
Oooh, blinded

1058
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:32,920
It's too harsh

1059
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,540
Snow blind

1060
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,490
I can't see at all

1061
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:39,720
Incredible!
-The snow is too reflective

1062
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,200
Coming out barefoot?

1063
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,260
No one around either

1064
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,160
Look! So many mountains!

1065
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,130
It's all mountains as far as the eye can see

1066
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:45,560
So many mountains

1067
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,300
Where the hell is this? Seriously

1068
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,100
Barefoot on the snow...

1069
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,370
Let's go

1070
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:56,240
Wait a minute. The white balance of the eyes has not been adjusted back

1071
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,580
It's been too long since I've seen the sunlight

1072
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,780
O the light of the sun

1073
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,250
Yeah, haven't seen the sun in over a week, right?

1074
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,680
The eyes must have been hit hard

1075
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:06,990
Emotions are running high!

1076
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,080
Nice!

1077
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:12,940
And so, while the mood was high because of the long-lost sunlight

1078
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,640
Both smiling now

1079
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:19,600
Both relearned the importance of protecting their feet in the snow

1080
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,120
What to do then?

00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,530
Among the items purchased from the Lucky Chance opportunity

1094
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:23,890
Ah massage chair is quite expensive

1095
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:25,880
They again sell the unwanted items

1096
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,380
And then

1097
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:31,040
Oh, here we go

1098
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,490
Three pairs
-What three pairs?

1099
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:35,750
Three pairs of socks

1100
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:35,750

1101
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:37,780
Oh, slippers.
-Ohhhh this is good

1102
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:35,780
Three pairs of socks

1103
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:35,780

1105
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:35,780
拖鞋

1106
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:35,810
Slippers

1107
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:35,810
Three pairs of socks

1108

1110
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:35,850
Slippers

1111
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:35,850
Three pairs of socks

1112

m 0 0 l 298 0 298 72 0 72

1114
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:35,880
Slippers

1115
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:35,880
Three pairs of socks

1116
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:35,880

1118
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:46,260
Slippers

00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:46,260
Three pairs of socks

m 0 0 l 300 0 300 75 0 75

1122
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,720
I thought I would get cloth slippers

1123
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,780
Not the one with the hole at the front?
-Yes, yes, yes

1124
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,550
I thought it would be a problem if it was like that

1125
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:46,260
If this is the case, it will work.
-Because there is no water seepage

1126
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,460
This should work

1127
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,290
Okay, we can use this to go down the mountain

1128
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:55,540
That's it, they bought socks and slippers to protect our feet in the snow

1129
00:35:56,810 --> 00:36:01,250
Finally, they're heading for the end of the line at Yoshimoto's Tokyo headquarters

1130
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,660
The moment has, at last, arrived

1131
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:08,410
Really ringing the escape bell for the last time

1132
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:09,070
Please

1133
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:09,680
Ok

1134
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,800
Okay, let's go!

1135
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,780
It's cold.
-It's a little cold

1136
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:16,110
Oh 43,500 yen, still got some money

1137
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:19,690
Looks like a criminal

1138
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,820
What a shitty place!

1139
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:22,630
The wind is really harsh

1140
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:23,160
Just jailbroken?
-Jailbreak sense is too strong

1141
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,920
The first goal of the two people who came out of the hut was

1142
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:33,000
Parked at a straight line distance of about 300 meters, the lucky item mobile vending cart

1143
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,420
What will happen?

1144
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,270
It feels like watching the life of condemned men

1145
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,260
Time and space are distorted

1146
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:48,890
Still haven't left yet

1147
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:52,920
Try to step in my footprints, will you?
-Ok

1148
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,680
So caring
-Wearing slippers, right?

1149
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,530
Feet are sunken in

1150
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:58,600
It's a little cold

1151
00:36:58,370 --> 00:36:59,400
So cute

1152
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,460
Ah, feet are really cold

1153
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,850
Keep going!

1154
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,530
Is everything okay?
-Oh, I'm stuck

1155
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,770
The snow is indeed very deep

1156
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:06,640
Go back?

1157
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,400
Feet are really not working

1158
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,570
Also wearing shorts

1159
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,970
Are you okay?
-My foot was hit hard

1160
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:12,280
Although there are slippers, right?

1161
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,710
Cold, really cold

1162
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:14,900
Emergency evacuation?

1163
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,510
This snow is too difficult to top

1164
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:20,720
What the hell is going on here? Where are we?

1165
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,120
Why is the snow so thick?

1166
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:26,090
Too tough

1167
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:26,920
Head back

1168
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,630
It's that bridge over there, right? Go that way, right?

1169
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,600
Seen it? You seen it?

1170
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:30,720
Ahhhhh

1171
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,380
You can do it!

1172
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:36,170
I'm stuck

1173
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:39,070
All the snow is pouring in and my socks are soaking wet

1174
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:42,570
My feet hurt~

1175
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:46,040
My feet are already in a bad state

1176
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,150
Can't walk like this

1177
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:52,460
Sure enough, in the snow where your feet can sink in

1178
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:55,020
Isn't it reckless to walk in only flip-flops?

1179
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:00,360
Soon the cold turned to pain

1180
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,560
Only a little better than barefoot

1181
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,720
Crouched down on the spot

1182
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,740
But they've come so far

1183
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:05,530
Ah can't stand it!

1184
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:08,830
Aah! It hurts!

1185
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,860
Have gone too far to return

1186
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:11,200
It hurts~

1187
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,510
What to do?

1188
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,170
Pour some pee on it, right? How about that?

1189
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:16,940
Seriously, it might be warmer to pee on it

1190
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,920
Humans are incredible

1191
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,850
The two who have no means to warm their feet

1192
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:27,850
Stay there for a total of 15 minutes

1193
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:30,720
Okay, you go first

1194
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,020
Leave me behind and you go

1195
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,960
What program is this?

1196
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:34,420
Let's go back together

1197
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,860
I've had enough of this

1198
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,860
There is only one last stretch of road left

1199
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,330
He'll die if he stays, right?

1200
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:40,810
Film-like scene

1201
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,500
Can you do it? Can you still walk?

1202
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,480
Can't leave him there

1203
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,470
How are your feet? How are they holding up?

1204
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:47,470
Cold feet

1205
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,560
It's like they're eloping

1206
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,940
Any car going there...

1207
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,840
It is no different from escaping

1208
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:55,950
Keep going!

1209
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,330
Slippers are hard to walk in

1210
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,080
What is it?

1211
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,060
Go back

1212
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,920
Is Wednesday Downtown this kind of show?

1213
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:09,790
It's freezing. Frozen into a popsicle

1214
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:12,930
Can't feel my fingers anymore

1215
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:15,570
I can't feel my feet anymore.
-Feet are done

1216
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:17,370
Arms are also starting to lose a bit of feeling

1217
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,750
Ahhhhh~

1218
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,700
Still a long way to go

1219
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,890
Still such a long distance

1220
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:27,580
Is 300 meters this long?

1221
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,980
It's getting colder and colder

1222
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,250
I can see the car!

1223
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:33,980
I can see it now

1224
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,820
Just a breath away

1225
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,060
Really like a movie

1226
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:38,120
We can do it.
-We can do it!

1227
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,160
We're doing it!

1228
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:44,630
Just 300 meters of untrodden path

1229
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:45,700
They walked for 2 hours

1230
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,760
Indeed, if the road is not good

1231
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:52,370
There's no more snow in front of you

1232
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:55,000
It's cold... my feet are cold...

1233
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,810
Finally

1234
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:59,440
The car's here

1235
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:06,220
Great, we're in the car

1236
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,580
Okay, let's go

1237
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,140
Let's go!

1238
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,320
We're gone!

1239
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,560
OK
-Ok

1240
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,180
OK OK OK

1241
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:17,480
Still don't know where they are

1242
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:19,030
Seriously, where is this?

1243
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:21,930
Where is this?
-It's too remote

1244
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,030
It's good to be able to leave

1245
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,600
Which way is Tokyo?

1246
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,500
I can't tell at all

1247
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:28,660
Yes, there is nothing around

1248
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,340
Ah, there are many private houses

1249
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,510
There may be several households

1250
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,840
There are several houses

1251
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,280
They look too suspicious

1252
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,780
Isn't it scary? Such a person suddenly coming to the door

1253
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,140
Coming to the door in slippers

1254
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,050
Surely suspicious

1255
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:46,090
Sorry to disturb you

1256
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:50,760
We are filming a program from TBS

1257
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,700
Don't do it!

1258
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,030
Can we talk for a little bit?

1259
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,960
Super scary

1260
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:59,470
By the way, what county is this?

1261
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,600
Nagano Prefecture

1262
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:02,510
Nagano Prefecture ...

1263
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:05,480
Where are we in Nagano Prefecture? What is the name of this place?

1264
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,640
Hakuba

1265
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,810
Hakuba?

1266
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,450
Sorry i'm a bit confused

1267
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:14,720
Thank you

1268
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,320
Sorry

1269
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,230
The kid is a little frightened

1270
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:22,630
Eh?

1271
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,930
Where did they say we are?
-Here...

1272
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:27,430
Hakuba in Nagano Prefecture

1273
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:29,330
Hakuba?

1274
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:31,400
Hakuba...

1275
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:37,440
Okay, let's go back to Tokyo

1276
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:42,750
It's finally over!
-It's finally over

1277
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,680
8 km from Hachioji! Almost there! Almost to Tokyo!
-Great!

1278
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,850
We're almost in Tokyo!
-Awesome!

1279
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:49,050
We're in Tokyo!

1280
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,390
Yes!

1281
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:53,020
Yes! Back to Tokyo!

1282
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:58,110
Spring... the distant spring...

1283
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:03,560
If you close your eyelids, there will be

1284
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:01,860
Run out of gas!

1285
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:04,870
We're here!

1286
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:07,040
Arrival Kabukicho

1287
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,370
A familiar place.
-Kabukicho!

1288
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:14,940
We've arrived at Kabukicho, where Yoshimoto headquarters is located

1289
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:19,680
Wow, what a relief!

1290
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,210
Civilized society

1291
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:23,720
It's been so long since i've seen women

1292
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,490
And then

1293
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,060
That's a bit...

1294
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,040
Will this line be used?

1295
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,760
After 12 days

1296
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:39,780
A total of 268 hours, they escaped and returned with only the help of lucky items

1297
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:44,440
How was it? Lucky item life

1298
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,440
What kind of question are you asking? It was obviously awful

1299
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,410
But it's not like there's another job tomorrow, right?

1300
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:53,950
In terms of comedy jobs, this month there is just one more

1301
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:56,350
One live show
-Only one live show

1302
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:02,060
That live is on January 11

1303
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:03,860
And?
-Eh? Is that the end of it?

1304
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:07,050
A sad ending

1305
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:07,680
But they finally came back

1306
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,070
A grimmer reality awaits them

1307
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:12,960
It'd be better if something happened after escaping

1308
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,670
The car broke down or something

1309
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:18,810
By the way, you were saying that very loudly.
-You've been saying it a lot

1310
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:20,340
Run out of gas!

1311
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,110
In a very loud voice

1312
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:24,380
"Gasoline disappear!"

1313
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:28,550
When they arrived in Kabukicho, he said, "Ah..."

1314
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:29,420
The feeling that this is the end?

1315
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,210
And the Hakuba kid

1316
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:33,400
You shouldn't open the door so easily
-Indeed

1317
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,720
So true

1318
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,490
Absolutely wrong, wearing shorts with flip-flops

1319
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:40,330
An older man with a cape came knocking on the door

1320
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:44,680
At least put the chain on

1321
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:46,260
To prevent crime

1322
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,040
So then, everyone

1323
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:51,910
Please welcome them onto the stage

1324
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:53,290
Oh!
-Awesome!

1325
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,530
Thank you all

1326
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:01,980
We're back!

1327
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,120
Thank you for your hard work.
-Welcome back

1328
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,580
Yeah, it was too hard, really

1329
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:08,290
It's a relief to be back
-Finally, we're back

1330
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:10,190
The end of the VTR was too unpleasant

1331
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:11,790
I thought you had passed away

1332
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:13,600
We are alive
-Alive and well

1333
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,730
How do you feel? You must have a lot of questions you want to ask

1334
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:19,300
When did you first notice the mobile vending cart?

1335
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,310
When we came out to let off steam during the day

1336
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:22,880
Did you see it?
-So far in the distance

1337
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:26,130
Walked out with the feeling of "that should be it"

1338
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:28,140
But weren't sure when you actually left

1339
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,480
Yes. Also the staff

1340
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,520
Wouldn't answer any questions

1341
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,930
Is that it? Wouldn't even answer even when asked that.
-I see

1342
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:36,920
No one would say anything

1343
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,160
Should we go that way? They you won't answer even if you ask

1344
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,220
We just had to try

1345
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:43,430
Well, the staff here have communication problems

1346
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,570
Is that so?

1347
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:45,440
Really?

1348
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,160
They are people who have not learned to speak

1349
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,240
You were the same as Nanamagari, right? Just wanted to smoke

1350
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,370
It's better to quit smoking

1351
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:56,440
Just for that you wasted time and money

1352
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,310
Yeah, but I can't do it.
-Why

1353
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:02,810
If you do not have a cigarette, you will go crazy

1354
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:04,050
Really?

1355
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:08,380
I really looked forward to smoking a cigarette or two every day

1356
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:09,360
But honestly

1357
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,750
You may be suddenly put on live or something
-True

1358
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:15,690
You'll be banned from TBS

1359
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:17,060
It's really possible

1360
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:19,220
They're on parole now

1361
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,100
We did it to get on TV

1362
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,570
All we have to offer is time

1363
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:25,740
To appear on camera

1364
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:26,960
Please feel free to use us more in the future

1365
00:45:28,100 --> 00:46:14,780
