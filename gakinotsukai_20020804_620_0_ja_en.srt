00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Today, our guest, Mr. Aigata, will be doing a punishment game.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I've already lost, so I can't help it.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
By the way, if you saw the punishment game this morning, please raise your hand.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But most of the people were ignoring it.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It was about half of them.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
They were like, oh, you're going to do it?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But you can see it today.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We went to the scene.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Was it a punishment game when we went?

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Matsumoto-san was having fun.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Let's go to the main character of the day.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Please!

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I don't want to leave without laughing.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Why?

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Everyone hasn't seen it yet.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Why haven't you seen it yet?

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'll say this, but that was a punishment game.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Really?

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You're having fun?

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
No, no, no, I'm not having fun at all.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
To be honest, I haven't seen my dad in a while, and I thought,

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I wonder if he's going to die.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Wow, that's true.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And then, I saw him in the middle of the night.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Seriously.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The next day, we were all going to Disneyland,

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and my dad said he wasn't feeling well, and he was going home.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And when he went to Tokyo Station by himself,

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
he was in a daze and he fell down.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And the station staff said,

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
He was like an alien that was captured by the Japanese army.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
He was like, Grandpa, you can't do this alone.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I said, sure.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm sure you can do it.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The Matsumoto vs. Hamada team has created a new chapter in the history of the children's use.

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The regular running and jumping competition.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This fierce battle between the two teams was won by the Hamada team, who showed excellent teamwork.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The punishment game by Matsumoto Hitoshi has been decided.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The punishment game is...

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Matsumoto Hitoshi!

41
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The last one is...

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You said it.

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I said it.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You said it.

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What is it?

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What is it?

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Why did you lose?

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That's right.

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Okay, okay.

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The punishment is the punishment of the year of the horse.

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You lost the other day.

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Do you know what this is?

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What is this?

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's like, sorry.

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's like the staff of the car wash.

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I saw it. I saw it.

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This is the jump of the problem that Heipon showed.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Now, I will announce the punishment of Mr. Matsumoto.

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You are not alone.

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Five people from the Matsumoto family will participate.

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The five people are...

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Who is it?

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This person.

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Mother.

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Father.

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Big brother.

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Big sister.

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Everyone.

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
First appearance, big sister!

70
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Second appearance.

71
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
First appearance.

72
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Is it okay?

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
In 5 minutes, Matsumotoge will do the Hero Award!

74
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'll do it.

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
This time, the punishment game is a Matsumoto-Renja-Ishou with 5 members from the Matsumoto family.

76
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And we'll make a theme song, and the finished product will be broadcast live for 5 minutes.

77
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Umm, overall, the age is already quite high.

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The lowest is me, I'm 38 years old.

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
As long as there is a competition in this world, the winner and loser will be born.

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Up until now, the people who have become losers in the use of children have been humiliated in many ways, which can be said to be the best of their lives.

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Matsumoto Hitoshi's Punishment Game!

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The President Matsumoto Renger Show!

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm sorry!

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What are you doing?

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Wait!

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm sorry!

87
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

88
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
First, a live broadcast of the video.

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Wow! Wow! This is fun! This is fun! Summer vacation!

90
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's not showing.

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Where should we go for fun?

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Where should we go for fun?

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Where should we go for fun?

94
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Wow! Wow! This is fun! This is fun! Summer vacation!

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Do it!

96
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Do it!

97
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Do it!

98
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
What is this?

99
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Help! Help! Somebody help me!

100
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Help me!

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Human

102
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Why are you using the word toji?

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Human

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The sound is so soft!

105
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm a ninja!

106
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm a ninja!

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
For me, I'm a real ninja!

108
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm a ninja!

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm a real ninja!

110
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Oh, what is this?

111
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I can't do this!

112
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I can't do this!

113
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,960
My shoulders are the only thing that hurts.

114
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,960
Oh my god!

115
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,960
Oh god, oh god, I can't do this anymore.

116
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,960
I'm going to the toilet.

117
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,960
I'm going to the toilet.

118
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,960
I'm going to the toilet.

119
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,960
I'm not good at this.

120
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,960
The grumpy face of Temiko.

121
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,960
What is this?

122
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,960
It's raw.

123
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,960
I can't do it.

124
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,960
I can't do it.

125
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,960
It's so funny.

126
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,960
It's so funny.

127
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,960
It's terrible.

128
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,460
They are!!

129
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,960

134
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,960
I can it sounds almost collapse No?

135
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:33,460
I can it sounds almost collapse No?

136
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,460
The country is!

137
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:37,460
Six traveled sea

138
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,960
All together!

139
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,960

00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,420
The winner is...

00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,420
...Yoshiyama!

148
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,420
Donmenger!

149
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,420
Don't say anything!

150
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,420
Win!

151
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,420

152

I know, I know!

153
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,420
Sakaari Donmenger!

154
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,420
I'm not going to let you sleep for three days!

155
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,420
I'm not going to let you sleep for three days!

156
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:42,420
Finally, I'm going to let you sleep for three days!

157
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,420
Who are you?

158
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,420
I'm a year old ranger, Okan.

159
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,420
I'm a child's pen.

160
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,420
It was hard, wasn't it?

161
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,420
It was hard, wasn't it?

162
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,420
Your face...

163
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,420
Please take care of me.

164
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,420
Thank you.

165
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,420
You're eating it!

166
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:05,420
Today too, tomorrow too, tomorrow too.

167
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,420
Charlie's jam is on the top of my head.

168
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,420
Please play it for me.

169
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,420
The sound is too heavy.

170
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,420
It's not heavy at all.

171
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,420
Today too, tomorrow too, tomorrow too.

172
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,420
It's okay to hit the wall.

173
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,420
Everyone, take care of your family.

174
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,420
I'm not going to cry!

175
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,420
It's been 6 and a half hours since the live broadcast.

176
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:40,420
What is it? Fujiwara No Matsu Japanese TV has arrived.

177
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,420
Don't get caught.

178
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,420
I'm sorry for the long wait.

179
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,420
Thank you for coming to our Japanese TV today.

180
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,420
I look forward to working with you.

181
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,420
Why is it my Japanese TV?

182
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,420
It's not Japanese TV at all.

183
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,420
Please say yes on Japanese TV.

184
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,420
Please say yes on Japanese TV.

185
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,420
Come on!

186
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,420
Yes, please.

187
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,420
Please.

188
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,420
What is this?

189
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,420
This is the room for the room service.

190
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,420
Why did you go to the room service?

191
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:24,420
I'm so happy to see you all relaxed.

192
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,420
Today, I'm going to be taking care of Mr. Matsumoto.

193
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,420
I'm Fujiwara.

194
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,420
Please take care of me.

195
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,420
10 minutes later, Matsumoto Family finally arrives at the Japanese TV.

196
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,420
He really is energetic.

197
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,420
She was fine at first.

198
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,420
She was fine.

199
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,420
She was fine.

200
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,420
Hello.

201
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,420
Hello.

202
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,420
Hello.

203
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,420
Please lead the staff.

204
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,420
Hello.

205
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,420
Please come here.

206
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,420
Long time no see.

207
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,420
Hello.

208
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,420
I'm from the same school.

209
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:26,420
Thank you.

210
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:33,420
I wonder who will be the next one.

211
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,420
I don't know who will say it.

212
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,420
Who will say it and who will do it?

213
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,420
I don't know.

214
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,420
It's difficult.

215
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:48,420
What are you going to do?

216
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,420
Who will do it?

217
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,420
Who will do it?

218
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,420
The flow is also difficult.

219
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,420
Like the flow of the river.

220
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,420
Hey!

221
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,420
It's a prison.

222
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,420
What are you doing?

223
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,420
I will explain the schedule.

224
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:11,420
First, I will make the cover of the Matsumoto Renjai.

225
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,420
This is the schedule of the Matsumoto family on this day.

226
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:19,420
From making the cover to the live show in Tokyo, they can do it without any time to rest.

227
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,420
Who is it?

228
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,420
It's me.

229
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,420
What is it?

230
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,420
Fujii Gaya.

231
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,420
Thank you.

232
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:36,420
First, we'll start with the action hero's soul.

233
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,420
It's been a while since I've seen you.

234
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,420
You're a white man, right?

235
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,420
Well, it's fine.

236
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,420
I'm 70.

237
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,420
I don't know.

238
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,420
I'm almost 40.

239
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,420
I'm 41.

240
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,420
I'm 35, so I'm 70.

241
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,420
I'm not 35, I'm 30.

242
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,420
Don't get angry.

243
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,420
What are you doing?

244
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,420
You're late.

245
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,420
I didn't take a picture.

246
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,420
You did.

247
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,420
It's the last one.

248
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,420
Why did you take a picture?

249
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,420
I took it.

250
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,420
What's wrong with this?

251
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,420
It's delicious.

252
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,420
It's delicious.

253
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,420
Why did you take a picture of your old face?

254
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,420
Stop it.

255
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,420
There was also a moment when I were invited.

256
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,420
A handsome, fit man?

257
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,420
Stop always having the names.

258
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,420
I didn't think it was paraffin.

259
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,420
Yeah, but everyone around us was saying so.

260
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,220
Did I say so?

261
00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:00,220
When I went camping with my family, I was like...

262
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,220
Will we all die?

263
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,220
I wonder if it's true.

264
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,220
It's more simple to watch.

265
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:13,220
But you said that you would definitely go home and do this.

266
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,220
I wonder if I will die in front of them.

267
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,220
I hope so.

268
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,220
What is that?

269
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,220
You don't know anything about it.

270
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,220
I don't know what to sing.

271
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,220
Let's sing.

272
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,220
It hasn't started yet.

273
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,220
We have to think about the lyrics.

274
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,220
Let's make a simple song first.

275
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,220
Oh, it's coming out.

276
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,220
It's coming out.

277
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:57,220
Protecting the peace of the universe.

278
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:01,220
My warriors are rising.

279
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,220
It's been about 10 years.

280
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,220
It's been about 10 years.

281
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,220
It's been about 10 years.

282
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,220
It's not that long.

283
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,240
I have to get this from the beginning.

284
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,580
Shioedo machinami ga

285
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,120
pisun disconnected

286
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,180
Hanako Malin

287
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,860
KarTarara ta yoru

288
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,540
The next line is....

289
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,540
I'm not sure.

290
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,540
What?

291
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,540
You're a child of the moon, aren't you?

292
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:47,540
To protect the peace of the universe,

293
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,540
the warriors of the universe stand up.

294
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:55,540
It's too much of a joke.

295
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,540
If you hit the pager, it won't work, right?

296
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,540
It won't work, right?

297
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,540
I don't know how to play the guitar.

298
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,540
Well, the bass is...

299
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,540
It's easy.

300
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,540
It's easy, isn't it?

301
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,540
It's a random C.

302
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,540
The rhythm is...

303
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,540
I can sing.

304
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,540
What is your family?

305
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,540
I have one family.

306
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,540
I have one cooler.

307
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,640
I, Mike has to do this way.

308
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,360
That's why he says I can't send anything on.

309
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,360
As we stand, we rise.

310
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,560
A festival ofThere is still tomorrow

311
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,360
The fate of Suminom allegory

312
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,360
Wait, wait.

313
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:11,360
Where is the Chosuke that my father named?

314
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,360
I remember.

315
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,360
I remember.

316
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,360
He was a cat.

317
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,360
He brought the cat home.

318
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,360
That's it.

319
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,360
That's it.

320
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,360
Chosuke.

321
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,360
That's it.

322
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,360
I remember.

323
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,360
I remember.

324
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,360
I remember.

325
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,360
Why did you eat?

326
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
I don't remember, but I think I ate.

327
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,360
I said that it was a good place.

328
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,360
I was thinking.

329
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,360
I was thinking that I should drink a lot.

330
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,360
I was thinking that I should drink a lot.

331
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,360
If I drink so much, it's definitely fun.

332
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,360
You're doing something you don't remember.

333
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,360
I'm sure.

334
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,360
Let's go with Ama.

335
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,360
I'm not going to drink Ama.

336
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,360
You are a Shioi, right?

337
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,360
Yes, I am.

338
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,360
I'm not sure about Shioi.

339
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,360
What do you think of Shioi?

340
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,360
Shioi's peace is Matsumoto's.

341
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,360
Yamada's peace is strange.

342
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,360
Hamada, Yamasaki and Kokoriko's four people came to monitor the team.

343
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,360
They are doing well.

344
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
Matsumoto family.

345
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,360
Hello.

346
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,360
It's been a while since I saw you, but you look just like your mother.

347
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,360
It's my first time seeing my sister.

348
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,360
It's my first time seeing my father.

349
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,360
Why are you laughing?

350
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,360
It looks like you're having fun.

351
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,360
I'm not laughing.

352
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:45,360
I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy

353
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:52,360
I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy

354
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,360
I'm doing it!

355
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,360
100 people

356
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,360
You're always singing when you're singing

357
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,360
I'm the brain of the Motoki family

358
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,360
I don't have to do anything

359
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,360
That's right.

360
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,360
You're really young if you're a child.

361
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,360
Hama-chan.

362
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,360
Yes?

363
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,360
You're not going to do it?

364
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,360
You're going to have a fluffy head soon.

365
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:28,360
I'm going to have a fluffy head.

366
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,360
Well, we can't watch the on-air, but...

367
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,360
What? You can watch it?

368
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,360
It's time to sleep.

369
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,360
I'm hungry.

370
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,360
You're hungry?

371
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,360
Yes.

372
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,360
I'm hungry.

373
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,360
I'm hungry.

374
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,360
Well, well, well.

375
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,360
You're hungry.

376
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,360
I'm hungry.

377
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,360
Ah, yes, yes.

378
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,360
It's hot.

379
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,360
I'm hungry.

380
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,360
I'm hungry.

381
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,360
Please wait.

382
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,360
Thank you.

383
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,360
It's 11.30 at night.

384
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,360
It's suddenly raining outside.

385
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:09,360
If you say Ottonranger, it's like a punch.

386
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,360
Don't say anything.

387
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,360
You can say sorry-smelling punch.

388
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,360
I'm sorry.

389
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,360
You always do that.

390
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,360
I'm sorry. I always do that.

391
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,360
You always do that.

392
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,360
Who is it?

393
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,360
You always do that.

394
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,360
It's Kai-chan.

395
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,360
He's really excited.

396
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,360
It's okay. I don't have to be 30 years old here.

397
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,360
How was it?

398
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,560
I'm a

399
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,360
Thank you.

B

401
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,360
After this, the king of anime song appears.

402
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,360
He pours his soul into the song.

403
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,360
This is my brother, Ichiro Mizuki.

404
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,360
This is totally different.

405
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,360
It's not different.

406
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,760
Y вообще...

407
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:28,080

442
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:59,980
I'm sorry, thank you very much.

443
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:04,980
Thank you very much.

444
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,980
We can't do this.

445
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,980
We will go to the hospital.

446
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:14,980
If you get better, we will come to you.

447
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,980
Thank you very much.

448
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,980
What are you talking about?

449
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:19,980
You can go.

450
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,980
Really?

451
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,980
You are so strong.

452
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,980
He is sitting.

453
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,980
He is sitting.

454
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,980
He is the best.

455
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:35,980
Well, if you get better, you can go.

456
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,980
Ah, that's right.

457
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,980
At first, he was doing fine.

458
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:43,980
But in the middle, he suddenly turned down.

459
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:44,980
That's right.

460
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,980
He almost died.

461
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,980
What's wrong with that?

462
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,980
He was really shaking.

463
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,980
I was really surprised.

464
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,980
I'll come out later.

465
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,980
I said, I can't come out yet.

466
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,980
During the rehearsal, I said, I can't come out yet.

467
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,980
It wasn't my father's scene.

468
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,980
I was like, aaaaaah!

469
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,980
I was like, what the hell?

470
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,980
I grabbed his hand and went over here

471
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,980
I went over here and his hand went like, pa!

472
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,980
Aaaaaah!

473
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,980
That was scary

474
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,980
You didn't do anything during the actual scene, did you?

475
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,980
Well, during the actual scene, I was just staring at him

476
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,980
You were just staring at him

477
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,980
I was just staring at him

478
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,980
It was already half-transparent.

479
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,980
Even though everyone has two bells...

480
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,980
Even though everyone has two bells, one of them fell somewhere.

481
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,980
The bells are ringing for me.

482
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,980
Do you know what the bells mean?

483
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,980
The bells are also...

484
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,980
This will continue to be looked up on from time to time, then!
