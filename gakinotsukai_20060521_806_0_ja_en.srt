1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
First time

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's do it

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's do it

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's not like that

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Today is the badminton tournament with luxury products

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This program is like

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's like shopping with luxury

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Today is a little amazing

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
If you get one point, you can get one product

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Really?

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This too?

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Is that related?

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This too

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I didn't spend any money before, so I'm doing it here.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I think I should definitely spend it.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I don't think so.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
But the wind is amazing.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's hard to do.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Is it okay?

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yes.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Mr. Kama said he didn't want to do it today.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Why?

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I saw the May disease.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
May disease?

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
How did you get on the bus in May, which is 42 times?

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
There was no such thing.

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Suddenly?

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I was dragged into the bus.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I had to go.

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I was a salaryman.

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I often see a salaryman.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I was on the bus in April.

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Is that Mr. Hamau?

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yes.

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You are in the back.

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I came to the jersey.

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I don't know if it's a TV show or a movie.

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Mr. Tama, let's do it.

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Please look at the products.

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's very expensive.

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Cars, motorcycles, cash, 1 million yen.

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
If you get 1 point, you can get 1 product.

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I don't want to do it anymore.

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I don't want to do it suddenly.

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I've been sick for a month.

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Since last month?

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
No, last month.

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Last month?

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
March.

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
No, it's May.

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
No, it's March.

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm sick of it.

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You're sick of it?

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
No, I'm not sick of it.

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I don't want to do it anymore.

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm tired of crying.

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Are you motivated?

58
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
No, no, no.

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What's wrong?

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
No, no, no.

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm tired of talking to my partner.

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What are you talking about?

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What are you doing?

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I said, you're a jerk.

66
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I was really annoyed.

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I was annoyed even though I was close to him.

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What's wrong?

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Let's go outside.

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I can't go outside.

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The tragedy that attacked Hamada.

72
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Is it really that difficult to get a heart attack?

73
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We can't record it like this.

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What will happen to the stupid plan?

75
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I wanted to do this with you guys.

76
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What's wrong?

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This is a spiritual thing.

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Do you want to do it with four people?

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
But the people who are watching will say why.

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That's right.

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What is it?

82
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Why is it like that?

83
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I wonder why he was so excited when he was shooting other projects.

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Good morning.

85
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You surprised me.

86
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yes, I did.

87
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You surprised me.

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Good morning.

89
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I came here for a concert.

90
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I thought I won.

91
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I can't go home without a key.

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But it's dark.

93
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The atmosphere is heavy.

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I have a problem with the batminton.

95
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Hama-chan?

96
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yes, I'm talking about Hamada-san.

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I have something to talk about.

98
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I have a bad feeling about this.

99
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Can I say it?

100
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I can't.

101
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
If you have any advice, I can give you.

102
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
No, no, no.

103
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I just want to say that.

105
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Thank you.

106
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Excuse me.

107
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I have to go to the meeting.

108
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Please.

109
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm sorry.

110
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Thank you.

111
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Thank you.

112
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I was surprised.

113
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I see.

114
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
There is no time to be surprised by the appearance of Yoki-Sem Nouchi.

115
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
To measure the early solution of the era,

116
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I went to Hamada again with the program producer.

117
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Would you like to do it?

118
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It will be over soon. It's the usual pattern of badminton.

119
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Well, I'm in a bad mood.

120
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
May.

121
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
May? It's not even April.

122
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
If it's not April, it's not April.

123
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's a disease that makes new employees.

124
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's not a new employee.

125
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What month is it?

126
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's not April.

127
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Masaru Shiga wasn't caught either.

128
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I've tried that every time.

129
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yes, you have.

130
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's scary.

131
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I wonder if he'll come back.

132
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
He'll be in trouble.

133
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
He's over 40.

134
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
He'll come back.

135
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What?

136
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I can't help it.

139
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You're acting like a young comedian.

140
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I said too much.

142
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm sorry.

144
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm sorry.

145
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm sorry.

146
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm sorry.

147
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm sorry.

148
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The recording was not good.

149
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Hamada was accused of being responsible for the program.

150
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
At this rate, the program's reputation will be in danger.

151
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And what will be the solution?

152
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What should we do?

153
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Are you okay?

154
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Is your head okay?

155
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But it hurts, right?

156
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I understand the feelings of young comedians.

157
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I was in a bad condition.

158
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Even if you talk, you will be in that condition.

159
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's impossible to talk.

160
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's impossible.

161
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's impossible to talk.

162
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
On the contrary, I want you to talk, or only badminton.

163
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yes, that's right.

164
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What's wrong?

165
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Can I film it?

166
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yes.

167
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What's wrong?

168
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm curious.

169
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But this is a school building, isn't it?

170
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yes.

171
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The atmosphere is different.

172
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
To be honest, there's nothing we can do now.

173
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
There's nothing we can do.

174
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
There's no progress.

175
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
No progress.

176
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:29,000
If I were him, I would take the boat and go home.

177
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I would not let Yuri scold me.

178
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I don't know.

179
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I know.

180
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I know the judge of the soccer team.

181
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I know.

182
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I have a license for a long time.

183
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I have a license for a long time.

184
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I know.

185
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I know.

186
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I know.

187
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I am his wife.

188
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I call him the same as my child.

189
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I see.

190
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
If you don't mind, I can talk to you.

191
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
No, no, no.

192
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
If it's unnecessary, I'm sorry.

193
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
No, no, no.

194
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
If it's not unnecessary, I can try.

195
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm a senior, so I'll be a little bit rude.

196
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You should have told me.

197
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's okay.

198
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:24,000
If you are going to do it, please do it, we can't help you.

199
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
If you are not tired, we are sorry.

200
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
No, no.

201
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Please do your best.

202
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Nomuchi is convinced by Hamada.

203
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
If you are not tired, we are sorry.

204
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
No, no.

205
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Please do your best.

206
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I think we should get closer.

207
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yeah, we should leave it to them.

208
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,160
Turn to the city lights.

209
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,000
Almost rush half-陳

210
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,720
Good morning.

211
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,780
How's it going?

212
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,840
Just happened.

213
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,700
Because...

214
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:20,700
I just looked at it.

215
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,700
You don't like it?

216
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:29,700
I don't feel like doing it.

217
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,700
You listen to Hamada-san, don't you?

218
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,700
Yes.

219
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:37,700
He's a senior.

220
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:43,700
I don't know if it's because it happened a year ago, but I feel sorry for her.

221
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:50,700
She said she likes me.

222
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:56,700
I said it, but she said she was sorry for being late.

223
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:04,700
It's strange to say that she's been working for several years, but she said she likes me.

224
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:11,700
I thought it was a good time to talk to him.

225
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,700
I like to talk to him in a cheerful way.

226
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,700
That's great.

227
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,700
He is like a big brother.

228
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,700
That's true.

229
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,700
I was given a free exercise.

230
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,700
And I was offered a job.

231
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,700
I'm grateful for this job.

232
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,700
And the audience is happy with it.

233
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,700
What are you talking about?

234
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,700
It's a long story.

235
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,700
It's hard to say.

236
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,700
I'm grateful.

237
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,700
You can only see yourself now.

238
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,700
Look around you.

239
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,700
There are many hard things.

240
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,700
Yamazaki, Tanaka, Endo.

241
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,700
They are hard.

242
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,700
What's hard? It's the existence.

243
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,700
It's hard not to realize that we're having a hard time.

244
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,700
It seems like that.

245
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,700
So, you know,

246
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,700
there's only one life.

247
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,700
One-way life.

248
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,700
Let's go!

249
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,700
Let's do our best!

250
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,700
Let's do our best!

251
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,700
I said I won't.

252
00:11:51,700 --> 00:12:03,700
I loved looking for the old days that fell from the train

253
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:14,700
When I closed my heart to sadness, the flowers in the flower shop changed too

254
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:28,700
In my town, just one more time, would you like to have some hot coffee?

255
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:43,700
I was asked at that shop, why are you here?

256
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:19,700
Is our love over?

257
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:25,700
The seasons have changed too

258
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:33,700
You came to visit my room

259
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:38,700
And you were always cleaning

260
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:44,700
I don't know myself either

261
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:50,700
Why are you here?

262
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,700
In the town where people celebrate shopping

263
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:03,700
The red light will soon be lit

264
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:15,700
I'm just a man who's broken and is going home today

265
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:23,700
I can't cross the bridge alone

266
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:29,700
Why are you here?

267
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:49,440
In todays' time, I will talk to you about your such a vineawlial play of Bootydzル

268
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,440
I'll just run away from the crowd and go home

269
00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:02,440
I can't cross this bridge alone

270
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:08,440
I'm waiting for your voice

271
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,440
I don't know.

272
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,440
At this point, I can't say anything.

273
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,440
You can't say anything.

274
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,440
I'm sorry, but your glasses are too tight.

275
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,440
Your glasses are really tight.

276
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,440
Your glasses are really tight.

277
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,440
Tight?

278
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,440
Do I look like I'm dying?

279
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,440
I have something here.

280
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,440
Which one?

281
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,440
This is amazing.

282
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,440
This is all stress.

283
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,440
Really?

284
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,440
In short, the world is full of fools.

285
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,440
Every time I meet a fool, I get a cramp.

286
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,440
I can't fix it.

287
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,440
It's true.

288
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,440
When I'm in the car and waiting for someone to call me on my cell phone,

289
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,440
I'm calling you from a place that's not that big.

290
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:30,440
If I stop here, you can't stop here.

291
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,440
That idiot Saka Gen is stupid.

292
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,440
If you do that, I will be half bad.

293
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,440
Why?

294
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:50,440
If you shift a little, I will be 50% of your stupid luck.

295
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,440
If a stranger comes, he'll be like,

296
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,440
Why are you staying here, you idiot?

297
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,440
I'll be alone.

298
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,440
Me?

299
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,440
I see.

300
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,440
And then, from there,

301
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,440
I'll be like,

302
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,440
I'll be like this.

303
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,440
I see.

304
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,440
I'll get one,

305
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,440
I'll get half of it.

306
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,440
But the guy who stayed with me,

307
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,440
I'm not getting it.

308
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,440
I gave you everything.

309
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,440
I gave you everything.

310
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:21,440
It's like, you got pushed by a stinky, dirty poop and got one.

311
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,440
That's not true.

312
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,440
You're still a poop.

313
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,440
Why?

314
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,440
Why? I'm just saying it's not true.

315
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,440
You're really full of stupidity.

316
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,440
I want to change that. Can I become a mayor?

317
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,440
Please.

318
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,440
When I become a mayor, what I want to change the most is the parking lot at the intersection that's not that big.

319
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,440
I want to make all of the main lines of the train a meter behind.

320
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,440
I want to make it a straight line.

321
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,440
I can't turn when it comes.

322
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,440
You are a blind man now.

323
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,440
Okappa is a fool.

324
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,440
Okappa? Okappa is Okappa.

325
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:13,440
Next month, I have a question for Matsumoto Residen.

326
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,440
You were a gorilla until you were in the third grade of elementary school.

327
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,440
Why did you change to a hippo when you were in the fourth grade?

328
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,440
If I were a gorilla, I would say,

329
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,440
Put on the Matsumoto.

330
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,440
I don't know what to say.

331
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,440
I can't say,

332
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,440
I'm a gorilla, so I say,

333
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,440
Put on the Matsumoto.

334
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,440
I can't say it at all.

335
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,440
Say it properly.

336
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,440
Say it properly.

337
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,440
The Takuon boom is coming.

338
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,440
It's not a boom.

339
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,440
Say it properly.

340
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,440
Say it properly.

341
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,440
Is this the first car you bought?

342
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,440
The first car I bought?

343
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,440
I think it was the Mk2.

344
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,440
Ah, before that, I bought it for 10,000 yen.

345
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,440
Starlet.

346
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,440
Starlet.

347
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,440
Yes.

348
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,440
As if you were going from Starlet to Mk2,

349
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,440
I'm a gorilla too.

350
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,440
No, that's strange.

351
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,440
Why gorilla?

352
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,440
Why did you quit Starlet?

353
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,440
Well, I'm a little tired of it.

354
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,440
I'm tired of gorillas too.

355
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,240
You have quite watered and washed from Gohokuringan.

356
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,500
You were aware of this, hadn't you?

357
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:06,380
No, cars, being

358
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,680
no, cars, being

359
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,060
hey,Being

360
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:09,220

366

367

hey,Being

368

hey,Being

369
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,240
hey,Being

370
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:10,380
hey,Being

371
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:10,600
hey,Being

372
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:10,800
hey,Being

373
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:10,920
hey,Being

374
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:10,940
Eh?

375
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,540
Eh?

376
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:11,600
Eh?

377
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:11,660
Eh?

378
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:11,720
Eh?

379
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:11,800
Eh?

380
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:11,880
Eh?

381
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:11,600
Eh?

382
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,020
Eh?

383
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,000
Ah,

384
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,100
Ah...

385
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:12,180
Ah...

386
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:16,800
Isn't this not a

387
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,620
Is the

388
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,140
Is the

389
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,540
What is

390
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,180
what

391
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:22,940
Oh

392
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,100
Oh

393
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:23,080
Oh

394
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,100
Oh

395
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:23,140
What

396
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,220
Oh

397
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,380
Oh

398
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,380
I was waiting for the gorilla.

399
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,380
You were at home?

400
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,380
I was waiting.

401
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,380
Where were you waiting?

402
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,380
At the Churin-Jyo.

403
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,380
It's the Gourin-Jyo.

404
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,380
Why are you saying it again?

405
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,380
You should have said it first.

406
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,380
I did the Japanese style stop.

407
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,380
In my case, the gorilla was facing this way.

408
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,380
I was in the way, so the gorilla was facing this way.

409
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,380
After that, the gorilla did this.

410
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,380
No, no, no.

411
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,380
No, no, no.

412
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,380
Gorillas always do this.

413
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,380
Yes, there are times like this.

414
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,380
No, no, no.

415
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,380
Hey, take it off.

416
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,380
Hey, Saki.

417
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,380
No, no, no.

418
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,380
You...

419
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:13,380
You're using my power to come here and hit me.

420
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,380
You're a counter, you idiot.

421
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,380
No, no, if you get off here,

422
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,380
you'll stay still until you get home after class.

423
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,380
I can go there immediately.

424
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,380
I can go there immediately.

425
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,380
You can go there and then you can go here?

426
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,380
Yes, I can go there.

427
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,380
Gorillas can go wild sometimes.

428
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,380
Can you control them in third grade?

429
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,380
It's different from Mk.II.

430
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,380
Right?

431
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,380
What do you do when they go wild?

432
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,380
I have to give them food.

433
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,380
I have to give them food.

434
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,380
Give them food?

435
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:49,380
You are going to kill me too?

436
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,380
Yes, it was hard.

437
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:57,380
But the fuel consumption was getting worse.

438
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,380
This is interesting.

439
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,380
At first, the gorilla who was running with only one banana was like,

440
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,380
It's just one banana!

441
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,380
He was like that.

442
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,380
So you changed to a cover?

443
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,380
I changed to a cover.

444
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,380
Because the fuel consumption was getting worse?

445
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,380
Yes, because the fuel consumption was getting worse.

446
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,380
But I had ETC.

447
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,380
You were in 4th grade?

448
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,380
You were not in 4th grade when you switched.

449
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,380
You were in 2nd grade when you switched.

450
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,380
I wasn't in 2nd grade.

451
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,380
ETC...

452
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,380
Yes.

453
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,380
What?

454
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,380
Don't do it.

455
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,380
Stop with the chest.

456
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:49,380
I'll tell you to pretend to be dead if you meet a bear, but what is the best way to deal with aliens?

457
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,380
Ah, that's right.

458
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,380
What is it?

459
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,380
You've never met an alien, have you?

460
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,380
You know, that woman, the alien.

461
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,380
Yes, yes.

462
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,380
She's Shigani Weaver.

463
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,380
First, you have to make it clear that she's not.

464
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,380
No, no, no.

465
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,780
The fact that he did not put on a mental image.

466
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,180
By leaving twist, he is not still a Shigani at all.

467
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,680
Seriously.

468
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,680
What?

469
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,280
When he became well known as ANIA, he asked me movement of his personality.

470
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,880
He now accept him on an additional level.

471
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,980
ANIA alwaysbook it is a Shigani...

472
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,080
Who put on Meyer Basoli's personality?

473
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,180
I don't know about that, but they always fail to tell,

474
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,880
that he is not Shigani.

475
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,180
Did you lose?

476
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,080
No way.

477
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,080
Like this, and then it goes like this.

478
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,080
It seems like it's going to be a bit slimy.

479
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,080
I'm not a shigani.

480
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,080
When I say shigani, the mouth inside the mouth goes like this.

481
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,080
Whether you're a shigani or not, it's definitely...

482
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,080
Whether you're a shigani or not...

483
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,080
Where are you looking at?

484
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,080
From the inside of my mouth.

485
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,080
Is this a shigani?

486
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,080
That's a stuffed animal, isn't it?

487
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,780
What are you doing?

488
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,080
Why is it lying down?

489
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,080
This is Shigani.

490
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,080
No, no, no.

491
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,080
It's there.

492
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,080
It's easy.

493
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,080
First, when I was told that it wasn't Shigani,

494
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,080
I thought it was Shigani.

495
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,080
Oh, oh, oh.

496
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,080
What are you going to do?

497
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,080
It's really embarrassing.

498
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,080
Wow.

499
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,080
The person who came out was like,

500
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,080
I thought it was Shigani.

501
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,080
It's a mistake.

502
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,080
It's a mistake.

503
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,080
I'm sure you're all like that too.

504
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,080
You've been hitting me all the time,

505
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,080
but you're hitting me with the Matsumoto sword.

506
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,080
Um, excuse me.

507
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,080
You're such a pain!

508
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,080
What are you talking about?

509
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,080
If this was a 42-year-old man,

510
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,080
he wouldn't be hitting you like that.

511
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,080
You're the one who's in trouble.

512
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,080
You're the one who's in trouble.

513
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,080
If it was you, you wouldn't have done that, right?

514
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,080
I'm not a Shigani to you.

515
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,080
At that time, I was told that I'm not Masumoto-san.

516
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,080
Oh, no.

517
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,080
It's like that.

518
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,080
Well, it's not a good example.

519
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,720
even though if you are installed personally�

520
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,100
Nice and everything, it sounds like you'll make everyone我是ma打証的
