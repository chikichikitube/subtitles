1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Tonight, finally, it will be revealed

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
An artist who makes such a ridiculous sound appears in the studio

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:27,100
I said it once again!

4
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:33,100
Ladies and gentlemen

5
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,100
It's hot

6
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,100
It's hot

7
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,100
It's hot and you must be frustrated

8
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,100
Recently you must be very angry

9
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,100
It's not because it's hot

10
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,100
Did you go there?

11
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,100
Where?

12
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,100
I heard that you were there

13
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,100
Where?

14
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,100
The golf bar

15
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,100
I've been there.

16
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,100
You've been there again?

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,100
I play golf.

18
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,100
Miyasako said that golf bars are fun but she doesn't go.

19
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,100
So I went.

20
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,100
It's a bar but it's golf.

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,100
There's a screen and it's like a ball is being hit.

22
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,100
It's like a girl is playing golf.

23
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,100
There are some rooms like that.

24
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,100
I was left behind.

25
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,100
And then he said,

26
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,100
Here you go!

27
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,100
That's too high!

28
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,100
And then the caddy came

29
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,100
And he said,

30
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,100
How many shots do you want to shoot?

31
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,100
And he said,

32
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,100
Yes, yes

33
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,100
And he shot

34
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,100
Well, 250 feet

35
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,100
Yard

36
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,100
He's pretty good, isn't he?

37
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,100
I said,

38
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,100
I can do it

39
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,100
And then he said,

40
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,100
Are you ready for the real show?

41
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,100
And I said,

42
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,100
Yes, let's go

43
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,100
And he shot

44
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,100
Then, he goes down again.

45
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,100
Then, he goes down again.

46
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,100
He's like, do your best!

47
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,100
The caddy is also cheering for him.

48
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,100
He's like, one more time?

49
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,100
Then, he goes down again.

50
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,100
Nine shots!

51
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,100
You're not good!

52
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,100
You'll never come back like this!

53
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,100
I can't even go through this whole thing!

54
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,100
I went home in 10 minutes.

55
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,100
You know, I'm so sweaty...

56
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,100
I couldn't hit it, so I got angry.

57
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,100
What are you saying? I hit it!

58
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:36,100
Even if I hit it once, it didn't react.

59
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,100
The machine didn't react.

60
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,100
It shouldn't react!

61
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,100
I mean, obviously, the object is flying.

62
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,100
It's flying so fast.

63
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,100
I'm sorry, I wanted to react.

64
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,100
Please say it again.

65
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,100
If I say, BANG, it will roll.

66
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,100
Will it react?

67
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,100
I don't know.

68
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,100
It's like, BANG!

69
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,100
I don't know why you're so excited about the golf cart.

70
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,100
It's not a shop that can be so excited.

71
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:13,100
I was thinking about going to bed.

72
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,100
I opened the fridge and saw a lot of bottles.

73
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,100
I was curious about what was inside.

74
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,100
Then, I heard a sound!

75
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:31,100
It was a sound of a no-shiku type somen noodle.

76
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,100
In the middle of the night, in the kitchen,

77
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,100
I can't find a single piece of somen that's a type of a farm.

78
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:44,100
I can't move.

79
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,100
I'm not saying that, but I can't eat somen at home.

80
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,100
That's right, I can't eat it at home.

81
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:56,100
What will everyone do?

82
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,100
What?

83
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,100
I can't even clean the house.

84
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,100
I see.

85
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,100
There are many parts of the body that are flying around.

86
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,100
If you move, it will stick to your legs.

87
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,100
Anyway, I don't know what to do.

88
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,100
I see.

89
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,100
I want to sleep. I really want to sleep.

90
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,100
But I'm a type of brain-dead person.

91
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,100
Oh, okay.

92
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,100
I'm going to go back slowly.

93
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,200
I'm going to do this with a

94
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,100
really sticky shadow.

95
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,100
Why is that?

96
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,100
I can't stand it.

97
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,100
And it takes about 2 hours to clean it.

98
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,100
Even though I clean it, it's completely finished.

99
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,100
When I look at it like this, it's completely shiny.

100
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:44,100
And it smells like soy sauce.

101
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,100
And I wonder how I should eat this somen.

102
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,100
That's...

103
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,100
I have a sweat.

104
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,100
I don't know why.

105
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,100
I don't know why, but I guess it can't be helped.

106
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,100
I also made a trickle-wiper.

107
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,100
Yes, yes.

108
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,100
Something like this.

109
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,100
Something like this.

110
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,100
Like this.

111
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,100
I feel like I can't pull my fingers out at once.

112
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,100
I see.

113
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,100
It hurts.

114
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,100
I see.

115
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,100
I made that and made a trickle.

116
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,100
It's over in one go.

117
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,100
It's sticky.

118
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,100
It hurts.

119
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,100
You should study more.

120
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,100
No matter how many times I do it, it's not enough.

121
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,100
It's so sticky.

122
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,100
It's sticky.

123
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,100
Why is that?

124
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,100
It's because of the brain.

125
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:49,100
Today, we have a special project.

126
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,100
That's right.

127
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,100
For now, Saki, please.

128
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,100
Thank you.

129
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,100
Thank you.

130
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,100
Thank you.

131
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,100
Thank you.

132
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,100
Thank you.

133
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,100
Thank you.

134
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,100
Thank you.

135
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,100
Thank you.

136
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,100
I'm sorry.

137
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,100
I'm shooting a summer video.

138
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,100
I'm in Okinawa.

139
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:24,100
I don't think you know, but my junior is a rice ball.

140
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,100
Hatsumi.

141
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,100
I don't think you know.

142
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:35,100
This time, Yamagaki, Miyasako and my junior who is in love with Miyasako are rice balls.

143
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,100
It's about 2 meters long.

144
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,100
Seriously.

145
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,100
I said, you're sweating a lot!

146
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,100
He said, this is not sweat. It's rice's Tokijiru.

147
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,100
No one will laugh.

148
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:56,100
I took this to the bodyguard.

149
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,100
He was originally a volleyball player.

150
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,100
He wore glasses and brought a suit.

151
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,100
I brought it here, or rather I brought it here on my own.

152
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,100
And then, all the way through Okinawa, I was doing radio like this.

153
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,100
Why?

154
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,100
I was doing earphones like this, saying, no, no, no, no, no, no.

155
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,100
If someone came, I'd say, I'll drink it!

156
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:24,100
This guy, his spitting sound is amazing.

157
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,100
Spitting isn't like that.

158
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,100
It's not like that?

159
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,100
You can't say spitting.

160
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,100
I see.

161
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,100
He's screaming!

162
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,100
It's so funny!

163
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,100
Well, that's how it is.

164
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,100
Yes, yes, yes.

165
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,100
Last time, right?

166
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,100
You don't know, do you?

167
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,100
No, I don't know at all.

168
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,100
We don't know either.

169
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,100
We don't know either.

170
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,100
We've never seen it either.

171
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,100
We've never seen it either.

172
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,100
I also came to Okinawa for the first time.

173
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,100
You don't know, do you?

174
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,100
I came to Okinawa for the first time.

175
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,100
Then I'm fine with it.

176
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,100
What kind of answer is that?

177
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,100
Wait a minute. It's like I'm introducing the rice balls.

178
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,100
It's like a rice ball.

179
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,100
This is the secret of the boss.

180
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,100
I'm not going to let you go!

181
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,100
I'm going to hit you on the knee!

182
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,100
I'm going to show you my secret.

183
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,100
Here's the rice ball.

184
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,100
Oh, amazing!

185
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,100
It's stretched!

186
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,100
It's stretched!

187
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:55,100
I can't handle it anymore.

188
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,100
Sorry.

189
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,100
What is this?

190
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,100
What is this?

191
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,100
Stop it!

192
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,100
I'm the one who will be in charge of Yoshimoto Kouki's special effects.

193
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,100
Why?

194
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,100
What are you talking about?

195
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,100
Mantaikonbi New Romance Onigiri

196
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:22,100
Honestly, in the 5th year, the stage was quite big.

197
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,100
It was a bit scary.

198
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,100
You're sweating a lot.

199
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,100
This is not sweat.

200
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,100
It's the bone broth.

201
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,100
You're sweating so much.

202
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,100
It's slowly soaking in.

203
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,600
I see, I see.

204
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
You ask the body?

205
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
I ask the body.

206
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,100
I see.

207
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,100
He can weigh everything with rice.

208
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,100
Oh, really?

209
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,100
That's right.

210
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,100
Ask about his height.

211
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,100
How tall is he?

212
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,100
193 cms.

213
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,100
That's not it.

214
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,100
No, no, no.

215
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,100
I don't need to say it.

216
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,100
Well, well, well.

217
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,100
I can weigh rice with rice only.

218
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,100
That's all.

219
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,100
I understand.

220
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,100
Then, how big is his foot?

221
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,900
...27.5 hectares!

222
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,900
That's slowly changing.

223
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,620
The number is gradually opening up out of the vat.

224
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,080
Even theasserts increase.

225
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,880
It's beginning topast!

226
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,220
The number of products are growing so rapidly.

227
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,300
This guy...

228
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,300
into the goes!!!

229
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,780
Isn't that enough?

230
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,260
This guy had an intense dizziness.

231
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,760
The five of us went to the same room,

232
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,760
He slept outside for the first first two days.

233
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,760
It's too noisy.

234
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,760
The sound is really amazing.

235
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,760
We'll show you all that today.

236
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,760
How much...

237
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,760
You too...

238
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,760
You too, you can't do that.

239
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,760
I want to hug you.

240
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,760
After this, we'll show you a shocking sound effect.

241
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,760
The world's biggest comedian, Onigiri

242
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,760
Is there such a thing as a breath of air in the world?

243
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,760
To find out the truth, let's get closer to the comedian Onigiri

244
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,760
He's really big

245
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:22,760
Onigiri

246
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,760
Onigiri was born in 1977 in Hokkaido.

247
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,760
He was born in 1977, and he was raised by his father who was 185 cm tall and his mother who was 175 cm tall.

248
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,760
Onigiri grew up and became taller and taller since he was a child.

249
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,760
When he graduated from middle school, he was 188 cm tall.

250
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,760
And he made use of his height to work hard.

251
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,760
I wanted to be a player like Nakagawajitsu.

252
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,760
Yes, volleyball.

253
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,760
He dreamed of becoming a pro player and dedicated his youth to playing onigiri.

254
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,760
After graduating high school, he joined Meimon Shin-Ittetsu Kimitsu.

255
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,760
He started to spend his days doing volleyball.

256
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,760
The sun was setting and his dream came true.

257
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,760
He was able to stand side by side with Nakagaiichi.

258
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,760
But why did he stop playing volleyball and start to be a comedian?

259
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,760
There was a time when Mr. Nakaguchi's salary was dropped.

260
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,760
He was dropped at the gym.

261
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,760
That's what I thought.

262
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,760
That's not good.

263
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,760
It wasn't that good.

264
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,760
You're not good at all.

265
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,760
I'm sorry.

266
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,760
The rumour that the onigiri that became a comedian is amazing has emerged.

267
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,760
So this time, to observe the sleeping state of Onigiri,

268
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,760
we installed a camera at home and waited for Onigiri to come back.

269
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,760
Amazing.

270
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,760
Why is there such a big city?

271
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:24,760
Oh, I'm in the back room. I'm sorry, but I'm going to sleep now. Good night.

272
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,760
Good night.

273
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,760
It's past 1 o'clock in the evening.

274
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,760
Onigiri who ends the day as usual and goes to sleep quietly.

275
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,760
What kind of change will happen from here?

276
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,760
That's right.

277
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,760
I've seen it in my sleep.

278
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,780
Yes, it's a long listen.

279
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,380
Hmm.

280
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,660
Hmm.

281
00:14:09,560 --> 00:13:45,760
Well, I guess all of the back自己

282
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,700
when you feed your след also have this kind

283
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,700
Hmm...

284
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,700
I'll show you a video.

285
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,700
Oh...

286
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,700
Oh...

287
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,700
What is this?

288
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,700
Oh...

289
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,700
What is this?

290
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,700
What is this?

291
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,700
It's not a sound.

292
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,700
This is good.

293
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,700
It's a barotel.

294
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,700
It's so scary.

295
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,700
What is this?

296
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,700
What is this?

297
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,700
It's so annoying!

298
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:44,700
As he continued to scream, he found out that there was a law in the sound of the rice ball.

299
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,700
You're screaming!

300
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,700
It's not breathing.

301
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,700
It's so annoying.

302
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,700
I don't know why my earplugs are all wood.

303
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,700
The earplugs are making me angry.

304
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,700
It's breathing here.

305
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,700
I see.

306
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,700
It's breathing again.

307
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,700
What kind of comment is that?

308
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,700
I want to go

309
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,700
What?

310
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,700
I'm sorry

311
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,700
You can tell by this?

312
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,700
You can tell by this?

313
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,700
What is this?

314
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,700
When you measure the volume

315
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,700
It's huge

316
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:17,700
The sound of a

317
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,700
The maximum sound is 94 decibels

318
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:38,700
This is equivalent to the sound of an iron bar under the guard.

319
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,700
It's so weak.

320
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,700
How many hours have you been doing this?

321
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,700
How many hours have you been doing this?

322
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,700
Grandpa, grandpa, good morning.

323
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,700
Good morning.

324
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,700
Good morning.

325
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,700
I'll take this off.

326
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,700
Yes.

327
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,700
Can I sleep on the floor?

328
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,700
Yes.

329
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,700
What?

330
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,700
Wow, amazing!

331
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,700
This is amazing!

332
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,700
This is really amazing!

333
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,700
Amazing!

334
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,700
I don't have any more water.

335
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,700
I'm screaming.

336
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,700
I've never seen this before.

337
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,700
This is a secret.

338
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,700
Ahhhh!

339
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,700
I can't believe it.

340
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,700
And my body was like this.

341
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,700
Ah, that was gross.

342
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,700
What was that?

343
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,700
I was like, wow!

344
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,700
It's not fun to travel with this guy.

345
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,700
I had fun.

346
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,700
At that time, did you dream?

347
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,700
No, I didn't feel refreshed.

348
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,700
You didn't feel sleepy?

349
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,700
No, not really.

350
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,700
You're the type that sleeps without being tired.

351
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,700
Yes, yes.

352
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,700
You're tired when you wake up, right?

353
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,700
No, I feel refreshed.

354
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,700
Ah, you feel refreshed.

355
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,700
If you're with your girlfriend, you won't be scared.

356
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,700
I agree.

357
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,700
What's with that experience?

358
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,700
I'm looking for a girlfriend!

359
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,700
You're not going to say it?

360
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:50,700
I'll say it, but I'm really weak at pretending.

361
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:55,700
I want to ask the expert about the sound.

362
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,700
You should ask him.

363
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,700
The sound of a rice ball like a scream of a beast.

364
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,700
Will the expert answer?

365
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,700
The expert is always the worst.

366
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,700
I've never seen a video that looks like this.

367
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,700
It's scary.

368
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,700
As long as you watch the video, you can recognize the time.

00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,420
We need to win more decision

371
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,820
Ext jam 5

372
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,660
It's ordinary for this to be magic

373
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:39,660
It is also a risk factor for the brain, nervous system, nervous system, and brain function.

374
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:47,660
Therefore, it is necessary to get the medical equipment as soon as possible to clarify the cause and to take measures.

375
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,660
This is scary.

376
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,660
What are you doing?

377
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:00,660
I'm not lying!

378
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,660
But what you said was true, right?

379
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,660
It was true!

380
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,660
This is the end.

381
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,660
Let's watch it again.

382
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,660
Let's watch it again.

383
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,660
Let's watch it again.

384
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,660
Let's watch it again.

385
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,660
This is a valuable VTR.

386
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,660
It's more precious than the eel's roe.

387
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,660
It's still barely here.

388
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,660
It's already started.

389
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,660
Oh, it's like a dog fart.

390
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,660
I can't remember the last one.

391
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,660
This is a good one.

392
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,660
This is disgusting. I hate this.

393
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,660
I don't know this one.

394
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:05,660
Wow!

395
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,660
What?

396
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,660
Did you turn on the engine?

397
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:22,160

398
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,360

401
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,360
What the hell?

402
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,360
He's definitely saying it right.

403
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,360
He's saying something.

404
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,360
He's going like this.

405
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,360
Uuuuuuugh!

406
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,360
What's wrong with you?

407
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,360
To be honest, I'm sorry for bothering you with rice.

408
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,360
It's normal!

409
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,360
It's normal!

410
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,360
It's normal!

411
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,360
Don't cry!

412
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,360
I'm not crying!

413
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,360
What is it?

414
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,360
I just saw rice in your eye!

415
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,360
You're the one who's crying!

416
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,360
I don't know why, but I got hurt too.

417
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,360
I don't know why, but...

418
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,360
After this, we'll have grilled rice balls.

419
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,360
Can I ask you about the technique of making rice balls?

420
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,360
Technique?

421
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:50,360
Since it was volleyball, the speed of the back burn was half.

422
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,360
That's right.

423
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,360
The attack.

424
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,360
Can I ask you about it?

425
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,360
Ah, sorry, then I'll...

426
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,360
...

427
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,360
Sorry.

428
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,360
You're crazy. You're absolutely crazy.

429
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,360
I'll never do that!

430
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,360
I'll never do that!

431
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,360
Yamashita-san, please wait a moment.

432
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,360
Sorry.

433
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,360
Sorry.

434
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,360
Sorry.

435
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,360
Angel Akira, go!

436
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,360
Angel... who's Angel Akira?

437
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,360
Who's Angel Akira?

438
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,360
Angel Akira.

439
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,360
Hey, you can't do that!

440
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,360
I'm not going to do it again.

441
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,360
Wait, wait.

442
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,360
Just say it out loud.

443
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,360
You're the one who's going to get in trouble.

444
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,360
No, I'm not.

445
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,360
Do it with a chair.

446
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,360
With a chair.

447
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,360
How far?

448
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,360
Here.

449
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,360
This is bad.

450
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,360
This is bad.

451
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,360
You're going to get kicked off the high place.

452
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,360
Are you going to sit?

453
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,360
What?

454
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,360
Let's start

455
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,360
You're so annoying

456
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,360
You're so annoying

457
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,360
You're touching the dust

458
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,360
It's cute.
