1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The 6th Gaki no Tsukai Arai-n De Chichi-chichi Gainoujin Tsuri Senchiken!

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Mr. Hatsukawa, would you like to introduce the next contestant?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What are you doing? Isn't it too early to be so impulsive?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Let's talk more slowly.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Well, I'm glad you came even in the rain.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let's start with this person.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
He has won the last two competitions with a dignified top.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
He has already been a legend in the drama.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
He is too busy to go to the Seikan and he doesn't have time to do the Friday.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Mr. Matsumoto!

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I remember the face of the time.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If I don't get in here soon, the screen will be blown.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Because it's like a TV show.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Last year, I said I would catch all the black bass of Kawaguchi.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This year, I caught the one I caught last year.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Thank you.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,660
By the way, he is the g Gangster Bastion Leader Hamada Matsushita!

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,420
Hello 34 years old!

19
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,140
аж

20
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:07,260
is the first female Fusionist.

21
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,400
Such a womener......

22
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,500
He doesn't want to lose.

23
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,420
Please visit BUS3!

24
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,420
This man is obsessed with the evil spirit of the devil.

25
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,420
This year, he will finally become a professional.

26
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,420
The father of the devil, Itoi Shigesato!

27
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,420
Good morning!

28
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,420
Today's news is...

29
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,420
Please hurry up and give me the microphone.

30
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,420
No, it's not that.

31
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,420
Ah, it's here.

32
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,420
Itoi-san, what's the weather like today?

33
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,420
It's the best.

34
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,420
Is it good?

35
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,420
It's like a sweet rain.

36
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,420
A sweet rain?

37
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,420
Sorry.

38
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,420
No, no, no.

39
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,420
I don't know that either.

40
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,420
Please give me a shot.

41
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,420
Congratulations!

42
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,420
2 years in a row, he has 3 things to be proud of.

43
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,420
He has a black belt in Fami and Mashimaru.

44
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,420
Okuda Tamiya!

45
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,420
I don't care about the past.

46
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,420
Do you have any plans today?

47
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,420
Today, I will get in the way of others.

48
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,420
That's a bad strategy.

49
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,420
That's a bad strategy.

50
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,420
If I do it at my own pace every year, I will be taken away.

51
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,420
Even in the future, you will win this year.

52
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,420
I will remember that.

53
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,420
Please do.

54
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,420
Right?

55
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,420
It's hard to get involved in the conversation.

56
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,420
Please do.

57
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,420
Please do your best.

58
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:29,540
The

59
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,540
In My Power

60
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,540
Egu-chan

61
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,540
Thank you.

62
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,540
What is the

63
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,540
defeat that you have not won?

64
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,540
What is it?

65
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,540
What do you think about it?

66
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,540
It's like the pressure of Shimano.

67
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,540
Sexy Monkey of Rock, bringing the guitar to the lua, has appeared!

68
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:01,540
He is the 21st member of the 3-legged Yellow Monkey, Yoshinikan!

69
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,540
Welcome!

70
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,540
Last year, the first member to appear won the award.

71
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,540
I think there are plenty of chances.

72
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,540
I don't think I'll be waiting for the camera.

73
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,540
I'm always around.

74
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,540
I'll do my best.

75
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,540
The last two episodes have been canceled in a row.

76
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,540
Will the program regular be lost this time?

77
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,540
Omey Yamazaki!

78
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,540
Yes!

79
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,540
Yes!

80
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,540
That's right.

81
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,540
You can't just be excited.

82
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,540
Yes.

83
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,540
What?

84
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,540
I'm so excited.

85
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,540
Let's finish this quickly.

86
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,540
Please.

87
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,540
Please.

88
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,540
There's one more person.

89
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,540
There's one more person.

90
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,540
He's here.

91
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,540
He's here.

92
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,540
He's here.

93
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,540
He's here.

94
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,540
You're so good at ending.

95
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,540
You're so good at ending.

96
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,540
Last time,

97
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:09,540
I was watching from the front and I thought that there was also a beginner's rack.

98
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:14,540
I said it earlier, but what I do is that I think about how close everyone is to me.

99
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,540
Did you hear that?

100
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,540
What? Yamagaki, say it!

101
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,540
Hey!

102
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,540
You are... do your best!

103
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,540
You bastard!

104
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,540
Yes, thank you!

105
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,540
It is the greeting of the meeting of Mr. Hanagata and Mr. Kiriwaza.

106
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,540
Listen carefully!

107
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,540
I'm going to tell you all about it.

108
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,540
A B-class comedian like you.

109
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,540
A B-class beauty like you.

110
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,540
And a B-class actor like you.

111
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,540
And a C-class copywriter.

112
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,540
I'm a C-class person after all.

113
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,540
I'm a C-class person this year too.

114
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,540
Every year, every year.

115
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,540
I'm a fish in a pond.

116
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,540
I don't know if it's new or not.

117
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,540
Hey, Mr. Horishige!

118
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,540
Think of a catch-coup!

119
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:12,540
I've made a short message with your hard work.

120
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,540
First of all, Mr. Matsumoto.

121
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:20,540
This year, you should marry that person.

122
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,540
Thank you very much.

123
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,540
I don't know what to do.

124
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,540
I don't know what to do.

125
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,540
I don't know what to do.

126
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,540
There's no one else.

127
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,540
Eguchi-san!

128
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,540
Yes, let's go.

129
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:36,540
Eguchi-san, even if you take a god, you don't take a bus.

130
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,540
Thank you very much.

131
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,540
Okuda-san!

132
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:44,540
Okuda-san, Eiji's wife is calling for her sister.

133
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,540
What's that?

134
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,540
Okuda Eiji-san?

135
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,540
Again, Okuda Eiji-san.

136
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,540
Yes.

137
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,540
That's all I can say.

138
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,540
I was not confident to sing.

139
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,540
This is the most difficult part.

140
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,540
Itoi-san,

141
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,540
Wadaben Guts and Yoko Nara Biji.

142
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,540
Thank you very much.

143
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,540
Thank you very much.

144
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,540
Sorenkan,

145
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,540
What?

146
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,540
Kengoro painted red.

147
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,540
Wonderful.

148
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,540
It's not good.

149
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,540
It's a good live.

150
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:20,540
Now, let's start the 3rd round of swimming competition!

151
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,540
Alright! Let's start!

152
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,540
Let's go!

153
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,540
Have a good day!

154
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,540
This is a sponsor.

155
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,540
In the past 5 competitions, Matsumoto won twice.

156
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,540
Tamada, Itoi, and Kato won once.

157
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:48,540
By the way, Okuda has been in the second place twice in a row since the first time.

158
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,540
He has never won a championship in a competition.

159
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:56,540
Who will win the golden trophy this time?

160
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,540
Hey!

161
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,540
Just 3 minutes before the start, Yamasaki who has never hit a single target before suddenly...

162
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,540
Here it comes! Here it comes!

163
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,540
Hey!

164
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,540
Here it comes! Here it comes!

165
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,540
Hey!

166
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,540
Hey!

167
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,540
Hey!

168
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,540
What?

169
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,540
What's that?

170
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,540
What?

171
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,540
It's the first one!

172
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,540
I got the first one!

173
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,540
I'll get it this year.

174
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,540
Is it that big?

175
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,540
It's this one.

176
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,540
What's this?

177
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,540
But this year it's a little different.

178
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,540
If you get one, I'll tell you.

179
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,540
It's a big one.

180
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,540
It's small.

181
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,540
It's a big one?

182
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,540
It's coming.

183
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,540
What is it, Tamino?

184
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,540
Ah!

185
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,540
It's a bar!

186
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,540
I watch TV but I often get bar.

187
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,540
Again, Yamasaki-Kato's pair.

188
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,540
This time, Kato's hit is...

189
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,540
Yes!

190
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,540
It's not Kazuya, Kazuya.

191
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,540
It's not Kazuya!

192
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:03,540
This is the adult's calmness, Matsumoto Itoi's team.

193
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,540
Can you show us?

194
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,540
Excuse me.

195
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,540
Ah, you're here.

196
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,540
Before I knew it, Itoi had caught the first fish.

197
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,540
But when it comes to Itoi, it's quiet even if I catch it.

198
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,540
Is that so?

199
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,540
Then, this time...

200
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,540
Hey, hey, hey.

201
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,540
Oh, it's big, but it's small.

202
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,540
It's small, right?

203
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,540
There's a wheel area here.

204
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,540
Oh, oh, oh.

205
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,540
It's a little small.

206
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,540
It's big for me.

207
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,540
Oh, oh, oh.

208
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:35,540
I don't think I'll be able to fish this year.

209
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,540
I'll be cool.

210
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,540
I'm embarrassed to be so loud like Yamazaki.

211
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,540
Everyone's like that.

212
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,540
Ah, it's small.

213
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,540
On the other hand, there's no one fishing yet.

214
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,540
Hamada, Okuda, Yoshi team.

215
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,540
First, the yellow-faced Yoshi gets the first fish.

216
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,540
He got a ball.

217
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,540
And then, he got a big one.

218
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,540
Oh, no.

219
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,540
It's coming.

220
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,540
It's coming.

221
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,540
It's coming.

222
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,540
Yes!

223
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,540
Thank you!

224
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,540
Oh, no. He's so excited.

225
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,540
It's coming. The wave is coming.

226
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,540
This is how he feels.

227
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,540
It's so noisy.

228
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,540
Thank you!

229
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:30,540
And for some reason, the last of the year's Yamasaki is the best!

230
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,540
I caught it!

231
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,540
The second one!

232
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,540
Shut up!

233
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,540
Furthermore, the Okuda that was barely running away earlier...

234
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,540
...is also the third one!

235
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,540
After the rain, it seems that there are a lot of fish this time.

236
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,540
At the beginning of the 20th minute, 7 out of 8 people had already started fishing.

237
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,540
And only one person left is Mr. Matsumoto.

238
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,540
Maybe it's not just me.

239
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,540
Really?

240
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,540
Really?

241
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,540
Mr. Matsumoto!

242
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,540
Mr. Matsumoto, come in!

243
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,540
Yes, this is Mr. Matsumoto.

244
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,540
I've already become popular.

245
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,540
That's what I'm saying!

246
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,540
The only one who can't catch is Matsumoto-san, so please do your best!

247
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,540
I'm already catching! I'm not letting you escape!

248
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,540
Hey! Hey! Hey!

249
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:30,540
After this, the incredible speed of Kato Yamasaki's amazing pair!

250
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:21,340
The prey is a carp, but it's a

251
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:44,340
momentary

252
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,340
Here it comes!

253
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,340
Here it comes!

254
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,340
Hey hey!

255
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,340
Hey hey!

256
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,340
You can't stop laughing!

257
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,340
And 30 points from the start

258
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:02,340
After losing to Yamasaki Kato, Yen-Yoshi has finally caught a big fish

259
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,340
It's not long

260
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,340
Give it to me!

261
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,340
Yoshinon, give it to me!

262
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,340
No!

263
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,340
And this time, Hamada...

264
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:14,340
Here he comes!

265
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,340
Ah! I got caught!

266
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,340
He was almost caught and was disappointed.

267
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:26,340
Meanwhile, Matsumoto, who hasn't said anything yet, is silent.

268
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,340
Ah...

269
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,340
Ah...

270
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,340
It's really small.

271
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,340
It's really small.

272
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:36,340
It's really small.

273
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:41,340
But, even if it's small, it's still good.

274
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,340
Matsumoto is weak.

275
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:50,340
From the start, the second place's score is getting bigger.

276
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,340
It's over!

277
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,340
This is bad.

278
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:06,340
It's long.

279
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,340
And Hamada, who let the big one escape earlier,

280
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,340
Ah, it's going to be found out again.

281
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,340
It's going to be found out again.

282
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,340
Ah, it's cute.

283
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,340
It's cute.

284
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,340
Can you show me the gentle side of it?

285
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,340
You're good.

286
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,340
You're good.

287
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:33,340
This time, the bus trip was really fast.

288
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,340
But, Matsumoto was left behind.

289
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,340
Really?

290
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,340
And then, finally...

291
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,340
He's here.

292
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,340
Oh, he's here.

293
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,340
Ah, he ran away.

294
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,340
He was big, right?

295
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,340
He was really big.

296
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,340
It's a dead end.

297
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,340
That's it.

298
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,340
He's frustrated and in a state of shock.

299
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,340
But after this, Matsumoto is in a state of panic.

300
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,340
Grandpa!

301
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,340
In the best condition, Matsumoto is alone.

302
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,340
And then, he gets hit again.

303
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,340
He got away again!

304
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:27,340
What should I do?

305
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:31,340
Meanwhile, a large amount of Yamasaki is contacting Hamada

306
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,340
Hello

307
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,340
Yes

308
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:39,340
Yamasaki and Kato team, right now, there are 4-50 people

309
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,340
What are you doing?

310
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,340
I'm fishing

311
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,340
I'm going to change with Kato

312
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,340
Yes

313
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,340
Can I drink a cup of sake first?

314
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,340
I'm sorry, I can't read it.

315
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,340
If you have time.

316
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:59,340
Well, I'm watching from a distance.

317
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,340
Can I have a drink first?

318
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,340
Please, please.

319
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,340
1 hour and 15 minutes from the start.

320
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,340
This is completely here.

321
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,340
It's surprisingly big.

322
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,340
It's huge!

323
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:24,340
Matsumoto gets the first one and gets the big one that will be part of the battle!

324
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,340
I got it! It's huge!

325
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,340
I got it!

326
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,340
Who is that cute girl?

327
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,340
Excuse me!

328
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,340
Excuse me!

329
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,340
Even if you cry, I can hear you.

330
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,340
Can you hear me?

331
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,340
I got it!

332
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:51,340
This time, we are going to do fortune-telling.

333
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:56,340
We are going to do fortune-telling for today's fortune.

334
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:01,340
Okada-san, you are the 4th in the last few years.

335
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,340
Really?

336
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,340
You have a great chance of winning.

337
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,340
Thank you.

338
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,340
Please keep quiet.

339
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,340
I'm happy, Okada-san.

340
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,340
Thank you.

341
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,340
Next, Hamada-san.

342
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,340
I will follow you from this year.

343
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,340
I will win.

344
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,340
Thank you.

345
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:26,340
Yoshio, you have no energy this year.

346
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,340
Sorry.

347
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:34,340
Okuda and Hamada, you don't get along with Yoshio.

348
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,340
This is the key to victory.

349
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:42,340
It's dangerous!

350
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:46,340
Matsumoto-san, Eomuchi-san, Itoi-san!

351
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:52,340
Let's do the fortune-telling time!

352
00:15:52,340 --> 00:16:02,220
Itoi-san, unfortunately, next year you'll be a

353
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,340
fortune-teller.

354
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:08,320
And itoi san is like archer

355
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,480
Baron Blow-down

356
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,480
It's time for the usual!

357
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:34,480
Using a special downtown lure, the person who catches it first gets 100,000 yen.

358
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,480
Last year, Yosuke Eguchi caught two fish and was able to win the game.

359
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,480
Who will get 100,000 yen this time?

360
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,480
Let's go!

361
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,480
The downtown lure time to earn 100,000 yen, start!

362
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,480
What's that?

363
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,480
It's not coming!

364
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,480
It's not coming, it's not coming.

365
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,480
It's coming, it's coming.

366
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,480
It's coming!

367
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,480
It's not coming, it's not coming!

368
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,480
It's not coming!

369
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,480
The ship that was about to leave the port dies.

370
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,480
But, really?

371
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,480
The ship is coming!

372
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,480
No, no!

373
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,480
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

374
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,480
Please don't tell a lie!

375
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,480
That ship is really the worst!

376
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,480
And then...

377
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,480
Here comes Eguchi!

378
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,480
Eguchi has won 100,000 yen!

379
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,480
Eguchi-san, you did it!

380
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,480
You did it!

381
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,480
After the luring time, the tournament is finally over.

382
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,480
Hamada, Okura, Yoshii are moving to the point.

383
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,480
Matsumoto, Itoi, Eguchi are also focused on the last spurt.

384
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,480
Yamasaki and Kato's perfect combination is a piece of cake.

385
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,480
Who will be the winner of this year's award?

386
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,480
And there is a surprising ending.

387
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,480
The miracle of 15 years has now become an album and has appeared here.

388
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,480
The final episode of Ecstasy.

389
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,480
Ecstasy Records.

390
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,480
The big announcement!

391
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,480
Mr. Hamada is drunk, isn't he?

392
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,480
His face is full of alcohol.

393
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,480
Really?

394
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,480
He drank a lot of alcohol.

395
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,480
He drank a lot of alcohol.

396
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,480
He drank a lot of alcohol.

397
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,480
He drank a lot of alcohol.

398
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,480
He drank a lot of alcohol.

399
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,480
Why are you so shy?

400
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,480
Let's start with Itoi

401
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,480
Let's start with Itoi

402
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,480
I'm 23cm

403
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,480
Itoi is 23cm

404
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,480
Look at me

405
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,480
I want you to look at my aura

406
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,480
rather than my length

407
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,480
But you did it before

408
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,480
24cm

409
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,480
Thank you

410
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,480
It's good, it's good.

411
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,480
Did you get it?

412
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,480
26 cm.

413
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,480
26 cm.

414
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,480
That's a lot.

415
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,480
That's a lot.

416
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,480
Haruna, you don't have any aura.

417
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,480
That's right, 24.5 cm.

418
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,480
Let's go.

419
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,480
Mr. Yagami, look at this.

420
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,480
You got it too?

421
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,480
That's amazing.

422
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,480
Why did you get all of them?

423
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,480
You've put in this much!

424
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,480
I've put in all of it, but it's already amazing, right?

425
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,480
Ah, that's not good.

426
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,480
Ah, 25.

427
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,480
Let's go, Hamada-san.

428
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,480
You can do it, right?

429
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,480
Ah, 26.

430
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,480
26, right?

431
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,480
26 cm.

432
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,480
Ah, but it's high.

433
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,480
It's high.

434
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,480
Next, Tamiya-san!

435
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,480
Chakurete!

436
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,480
Wow!

437
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,480
30 seconds!

438
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,480
Wow, amazing!

439
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,480
His chin is sticking out!

440
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,480
His chin is sticking out!

441
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,480
He always comes up to here.

442
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,480
Always.

443
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,480
That's right.

444
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,480
M-san, over here!

445
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,480
Yes!

446
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,480
M is Shoma!

447
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,480
I don't even have to measure this.

448
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,480
What's the value?

449
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,480
24 or 4.5.

450
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,480
It's 4.5.

451
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,480
It's 4.5.

452
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,480
4.5 means...

453
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,480
It's the 30th anniversary of the show!

454
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,480
Congratulations!

455
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,480
It's the first time!

456
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,480
It's the first time!

457
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,480
It's the first time!

458
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,480
I'm sure there will be more.

459
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,480
As you can see, the final result is...

460
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,480
The battle legend, Itoi Shinsato, has been humiliated once again.

461
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:23,480
The second-largest fish shop in Okutatamiyo, where he won the first prize, is presented to one person.

462
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:29,480
In addition, 10 people have the original downtown lure, a mega-buzz character.

463
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:34,480
We will give the book of professional search, which served as a guide this time, to five people.

464
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,480
Please apply for the product of hope at the name of the name of the product.

465
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:45,480
I really didn't want to beat Okuda, but it was fun.

466
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,480
Aida-san said that I was a bait.

467
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,480
If possible, I want to aim for the championship and continue to work hard.

468
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,480
I want to aim for the 4th place.

469
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,480
What are you talking about?

470
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,480
I'm looking forward to your performance next year.

471
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,480
Well, I'm 4th place in the first place.

472
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,480
I'm thinking that there are various rankings.

473
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,480
This year, I was 4th place in the black bus.

474
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:26,480
Next year, I want to do better than that.

475
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,480
Thank you.

476
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,480
I'm laughing a lot.

477
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,480
I thought I might get hit.

478
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,480
Next is...

479
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,480
The winner!

480
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,480
When I was eating earlier, I saw the members.

481
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:54,480
I was worried about whether I could get out next year in terms of age and position.

482
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,480
I was told that if I worked hard, I would be selected again.

483
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:04,480
I will work hard for another year and challenge myself next year.

484
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,480
I will be able to win the Mahjong this year.

485
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,480
I'm scared.

486
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,480
I'm a champion.

487
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,480
I'm searching for a prize that will only be given to the 8th place.

488
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,480
I'm not sure if I can win this.

489
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,480
Next year I want to give this to someone.

490
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:36,480
As I said from the beginning, my goal today is not to win, but to show you my aura.

491
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:45,480
The aura of Tsurizao. The aura when he's making people laugh.

492
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:57,480
I want to be a developer, or a salesperson.

493
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,480
I want to think positively.

494
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:10,480
As a person from the dark side, I want to be a system...

495
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,480
What?

496
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:17,480
Bye bye.
