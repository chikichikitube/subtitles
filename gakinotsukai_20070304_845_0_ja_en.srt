1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm not a fan of the character, I'm a fan of the character.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm a fan of the character.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
But I played here before.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You did, right?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I did.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Ah, you did.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You did.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You did?

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Monkey Magic

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Starting October, I'll be doing the show, Saiyuki

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's a Japanese TV series, it's a new series

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yes, I'm a drama actor.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'll be the main actor.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That's strange.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So, the company said that it's a bit too much.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So, if Downtown and Kokoriko can help me, the project will be approved.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I...

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The whole company hates it.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm going to go to the location, so let's go to the place where the dance is.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I don't know.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And you are the main character.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's the same in the world.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I understand your feelings.

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What should we do?

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Kintoun!

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Hey Yamada!

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
No, Kintoun

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Kintoun

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Kintoun

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Tonight Yamada

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yamada-san

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Teacher!

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm the one who's in the drama!

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm the one who's in the drama tonight!

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You can't get on.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This is dangerous.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm going to do it.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Let's go.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
This is dangerous.

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This is dangerous.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's not so well decided.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's a waste.

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Let's do it.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We'll play a trick and get 2 out of it.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And then, we'll get out of the one we got.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The 8 of them will play a trick and get 2 out of it.

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The one who can't do it till the end will be the first member to be eliminated.

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You can't do it anymore.

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You can't do it anymore.

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Ready, start!

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Go, go!

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Go!

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
No!

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
That's difficult.

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You can do it with a swing.

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Start!

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
With a swing.

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
No!

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Just like that.

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Just like that.

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Please watch carefully.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Start!

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yes.

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Out.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Out.

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Please do it again.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Out.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Everyone will be out.

70
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But you have to do it several times.

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Out.

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
No, no, no.

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Out, out, out!

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I think I can do it.

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Out, out.

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'll do it.

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Oh!

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Amazing!

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You're out!

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay, okay, okay.

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Endo is really good at this.

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
He uses it for cooking.

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I love this.

84
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What's with you?

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That was so uncool.

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
No, no.

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What's with you?

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I was like, I'm going to do it!

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You did something bad!

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This is fine, right?

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
That's true.

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You really didn't do it?

94
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I wanted to do it too.

95
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Because if you do this, you'll get two.

96
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That's not good.

97
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That's not good?

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's so bad!

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I bought a reason.

100
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The first one is out.

101
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Let's put it there.

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Let's put it there.

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I bought a reason.

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Don't come out!

105
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Don't come out!

106
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Only at times like this.

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Don't come out.

108
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
There's a lot.

109
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
There's a lot.

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's coming out.

111
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's coming out.

112
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's better to die.

113
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's in a different room.

114
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's coming out.

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
If it hadn't come out, it would have been a mess.

116
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I did it!

117
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
This is not Dengo.

118
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
This is not Dengo.

119
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I did it twice.

120
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You did it so easily.

121
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
This is not Dengo.

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
This is not Dengo.

123
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I hate it!

124
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I really hate it!

125
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I also hate it.

126
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I thought it was a guy who was out.

127
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'll take the punishment, so cut it out.

128
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What are you going to do? Yama-chan out.

129
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Zaki-san out.

130
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What are you going to do?

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Then what is it?

132
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Well, I can't say that it's a method of thinking that I did such a cowardly thing.

133
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I don't think it's a method of thinking.

134
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I think so.

135
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's called Chouhakuai.

136
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
That's a bit unfair.

137
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That's unfair.

138
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,320
Tell him.

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
He's wearing a sticky jacket.

140
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Did you decide?

141
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Oh, you decided on one person?

142
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yes, this time.

143
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm not sure if he's here, but he's serious.

144
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
He's serious?

145
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Well, but...

146
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I really hate the sales director, Kosugi-san.

147
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I don't know who he is.

148
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Stop using your personal name.

149
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's been a while since I heard that name.

150
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's been a while, right?

151
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Kosugi-san.

152
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But I think I understand why he's hated for his frisky style.

153
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Oh, really?

154
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But, you see, there are still two more.

155
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What?

156
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Are you talking about someone else?

157
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Or someone from a different place?

158
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Nagoki, you...

159
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You should have cut off the fight and not done that.

160
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What are you talking about?

161
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You should have done the PPP.

162
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Is that so?

163
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I thought you were going to say something, so I did something.

164
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What is that?

165
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
This is...

166
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's a hula hoop.

167
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
This is tough.

168
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And then?

169
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The next one?

170
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'll think about it.

171
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Then you decide.

172
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yes, I'll decide.

173
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Please.

174
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Oh, right.

175
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Kinton!

176
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Stop it!

177
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's Kinton!

178
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's coming!

179
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What should I do?

180
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You can't choose.

181
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I think that's a bit dangerous.

182
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
This is a game of Fluff.

183
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
There are two of them.

184
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's not that easy. It's a game of rotation.

185
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Let's have a match and the winner will be eliminated.

186
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
A match?

187
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yes, a match.

188
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
The two of us will play.

189
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
There are two of them?

190
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yes.

191
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The loser will be the next opponent.

192
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The two players will spin the Fluff and the one who falls first loses.

193
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The last person to be eliminated is the strongest member.

194
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Naoki, you decide.

195
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Then...

196
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'll do it with Oruma-san.

197
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Naoki will do it.

198
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Then, right away?

199
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yes.

200
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
If you practice, you'll be able to do it.

201
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Here we go.

202
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Ready...

203
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Start!

204
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Okay, finished!

205
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Delicious!

206
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I didn't think so!

207
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I didn't think so!

208
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It was delicious!

209
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's more like bamboo shoot.

210
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's like that?

211
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's a little more of a back.

212
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Bamboo shoot?

213
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm already out.

214
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's okay because it's bamboo shoot.

215
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Next, I'm out.

216
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm out.

217
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Me?

218
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Ready, go!

219
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Stop!

220
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's a dead end!

221
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
This is impossible!

222
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
This is worse than I thought!

223
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
My body is gone!

224
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I don't understand the meaning of this!

225
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I don't understand the meaning of this!

226
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's the same as the one that Kotonji dropped!

227
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What should I do?

228
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
At first, you should have done this.

229
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You should have done this.

230
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Endo, who do you want to go first?

231
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Endo, you should go first.

232
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Then, Hespo.

233
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Ready, go!

234
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's narrow.

235
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's definitely good.

236
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's definitely good.

237
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's definitely good.

238
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's definitely good.

239
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
If you don't do it before you get better, you'll never know.

240
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I don't know the meaning.

241
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Let's do it, Matsumoto.

242
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I don't think I'll lose this.

243
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Ready, go!

244
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You're done.

245
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yes!

246
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I will win for sure!

247
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Who is it?

248
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Hamada-san and...

249
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Nakamura-san

250
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Yoshinobu-san

251
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yoshinobu

252
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Please look at this

253
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yoshinobu-san looks like a turtle

254
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
He looks like a turtle

255
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I want to beat a turtle

256
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Let's go

257
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Ready...

258
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,500
Start!

259
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,500
Yoshiro, you were good.

260
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,300
It was close.

261
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,200
Yoshiro, you were good.

262
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,200
Endo was a little behind.

263
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:05,200
But Endo was a little better than before.

264
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,000
Yes, a little better.

265
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,500
Arudan.

266
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,900
Don't say that.

267
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,400
Arudan.

268
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,500
You didn't know this was coming?

269
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,000
No.

270
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,200
This will decide everything.

271
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,100
Yes.

272
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,100
I will win.

273
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,700
The one who loses.

274
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,700
Ready, start!

275
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,700
Wait a minute!

276
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,700
One more time!

277
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,700
Let's do it one more time!

278
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,700
We still have one more time, right?

279
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,700
You're really like a douji.

280
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,700
Really?

281
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,700
Let's do it one more time!

282
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,700
This is the world of Japanese.

283
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,700
No, no, no.

284
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,700
Ready?

285
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,700
Ready...

286
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,700
Go!

287
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,700
Which one?

288
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,700
That was a little bit wrong, wasn't it?

289
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,700
Really?!

290
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,700
It's the same.

291
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,700
You hit the shoulder.

292
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,700
Isn't that you?

293
00:13:01,700 --> 00:12:52,900
If you did that, it would have been a

294
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,700
It's the same.

295
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,700
Let's do it again.

296
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,700
Let's do it again.

297
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,700
Don't you do something bad?

298
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,700
You open your legs when you fall.

299
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,700
No, I don't do that.

300
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,700
Both of you do.

301
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,700
What?

302
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,700
You're lying.

303
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,700
You're really a doji.

304
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:29,880
No

305
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,880
Ready, start!

306
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,880
Which one?

307
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,880
I really don't know.

308
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,880
It's so weird.

309
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,880
This is the last one.

310
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,880
This is the last one.

311
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,880
This is the last one.

312
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,880
How bad are they at hula hoop?

313
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,880
I don't know what you mean.

314
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,880
I'll start. Ready, start!

315
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,880
Which one is it?

316
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,880
I'll start. The person who says Hamada wins...

317
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,880
Aso! Aso!

318
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,880
Then Enzo wins!

319
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,880
No way!

320
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,880
No way!

321
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,880
Amada-san wins!

322
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,880
Amada-san, you win!

323
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,880
No way!

324
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,880
No way!

325
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,880
No way!

326
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,880
No way!

327
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,880
I was just waiting!

328
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,880
I was waiting for you!

329
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,880
Amada-san,

330
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,880
Saggo Castle and Sanzo Hoshi.

331
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,880
I should have won Sanzo Hoshi at the end.

332
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,880
I see.

333
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,880
Then, let's go with Sagojo.

334
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,880
What?

335
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,880
You should do Sagojo!

336
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
No, no, no.

337
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,880
Sagojo is a bit strong.

338
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,880
What is that?

339
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,880
Wait a minute, this is also...

340
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,880
Ah, I've decided!

341
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,880
So, Yamachan and Hamachan.

342
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,880
Yes.

343
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,880
That's good.

344
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,880
There's no third person, but I think that's good too.

345
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:44,880
If it's something, I'd like to be the horse for Yamachan and the other person the chowhacker.

346
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,880
That's a good idea.

347
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,880
Even if it's just a trend...

348
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,880
Hey!

349
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,880
No, this is a proper drama.

350
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,880
What do you do when you are an amateur?

351
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,880
It's okay now.

352
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,880
Then, let's decide on the third one.

353
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,880
Let's decide on the third one.

354
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,880
How do we do this?

355
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,880
That's the point.

356
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,880
There are ideas for comedians.

357
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,880
There are.

358
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,880
Oh, this.

359
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,880
That's right.

360
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,880
Let's do the third one.

361
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,880
The third one.

362
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,880
I think Matsunaga is better if possible.

363
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,880
Well, that's true.

364
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,880
Well, anyway...

365
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,880
I understand.

366
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,880
See you.

367
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,880
I'm counting on you.

368
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,880
What are you doing?

369
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:47,880
I'm having a bit of a cramp, but it's a bit wet.

370
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,880
Yes.

371
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,880
So...

372
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,880
When you squeeze the water out, you can't squeeze it out completely.

373
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,880
I see. Let's do that.

374
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,880
One by one, they squeeze out the water.

375
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,880
The person who can't squeeze out the water will be punished.

376
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,880
No, just once.

377
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,880
No more holding.

378
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,880
Just once.

379
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,880
If you do this, it will be over after the Kabutogani.

380
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,880
It's possible.

381
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,880
I can drop it, right?

382
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,880
Yes, yes, yes.

383
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,880
Oh, well, it's still easy.

384
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,880
It's still easy.

385
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,880
Which one? Which one is easy?

386
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,880
Which one is better?

387
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,880
Oh, it's not that easy.

388
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,880
This is okay. This is okay.

389
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,880
Oh, it's okay.

390
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,880
This is probably going to be 4 or 5 laps.

391
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,880
It's okay.

392
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,880
I'm going.

393
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,880
It's getting better.

394
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,880
OK!

395
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,880
It's getting better.

396
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,880
It's getting worse.

397
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,880
Just one drop.

398
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,880
Ok, I'll start.

399
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,880
What?

400
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,880
What?

401
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,880
What?

402
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,880
What?

403
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,880
What?

404
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,880
You're too fast.

405
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,880
I'm sorry.

406
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,880
I'm sorry.

407
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,880
What did you do wrong?

408
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,880
I made a mistake in the hand.

409
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,880
You're not doing anything wrong.

410
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,880
I'm doing it.

411
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,880
You're doing it with both hands.

412
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,880
It's coming!

413
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,880
It's coming!

414
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,880
Here I go!

415
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,880
Just one more round.

416
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,880
I have to squeeze it in from this much.

417
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,880
Let's change it.

418
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,880
It's starting to look pretty empty.

419
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,880
It's coming.

420
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,880
I'm going to go now.

421
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,880
You don't have to go that far.

422
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,880
I know.

423
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,880
But I know. I'm starting to get impatient.

424
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,880
The first two.

425
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,880
The first two.

426
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,880
Wow! It's a squeeze!

427
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,880
This is bad.

428
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,880
Yes.

429
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,880
If it comes this far...

430
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,880
This is bad.

431
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,880
I think this new hair style is better.

432
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,880
Yes, let's make it new.

433
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,880
This is like a grip.

434
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,880
Next time, it's not good.

435
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,880
It's okay.

436
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,880
Next time, I'll do it properly.

437
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,880
Why is Mr.Sanji's hair like this?

438
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,880
That's right.

439
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,880
It's okay.

440
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,880
I feel like I'm losing.

441
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,880
The grip is...

442
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,880
Is that so?

443
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,880
I wonder how it is.

444
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,880
I'll leave it to you.

445
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,880
I'll do this.

446
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,880
Everyone is having some fun

He'd keep the guards and everyone would have some fun
