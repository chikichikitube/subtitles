1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This week's night's lip-syncing hit studio, the second half!

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Last time, the luxury lip-syncing artists performed their dreams!

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
A hot stage was opened up!

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And this week, the guests are coming in one after another!

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Who will win the award?

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Last time, the artists who were so good at talking were eliminated.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Next, the 10th person.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Now, the idol who debuted with a star's birth will go up to the next stage as a first-class singer representing Japan.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Nakamori Akira's Sasu!

10
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,320
I won't need a man that can deal with those entonces

11
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,920
Okay?

12
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:47,920
The flames that sleep in the chest that disappeared

13
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:56,920
Wake them up and chase after the dream that now flies away

14
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,920
Show me your real love

15
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,920
The flame that can't disappear from your chest

16
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:34,840
Souan Brother

17
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,840
Thank you very much!

18
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,840
Thank you very much!

19
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,840
How was it? Sing it.

20
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,840
Yes, yes, yes.

21
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,840
I can't hear you because you put your hand on top of it.

22
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,840
I don't think it's possible, but it says in the document that Akina-san doesn't have a single joke.

23
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,840
No, it's not Akina-san.

24
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,840
That's not true.

25
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,840
No, no, no.

26
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,840
A single joke?

27
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,840
Please, please.

28
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,840
I'll tell you.

29
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,840
No, it's not.

30
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,840
You can show it to us.

31
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,840
Is it okay?

32
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,840
Akina-san?

33
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,840
Yes.

34
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,840
Te-te! Te-te-te-te-te!

35
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,840
Te-te-te-te-te!

36
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,840
Ha!

37
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,840
That was quite loud.

38
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,840
That was quite loud.

39
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,840
That was Akina-san. Thank you very much.

40
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,840
Thank you very much.

41
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,840
He even showed the gag.

42
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,840
It's so precious.

43
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,840
Next is the mouth-to-mouth singer.

44
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,840
As the final weapon of the Komuro family,

45
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,840
he is a charismatic singer who has created many things in the 90s.

46
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,840
Amuro Namiede, Toraemi!

47
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,840
This is the one that makes you angry.

48
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,840
It's the one that makes you angry.

49
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,840
I practiced a lot.

50
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,840
He practiced a lot too.

51
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,840
The sound was good.

52
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,840
I don't know this one.

53
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,840
I wrote it on the back of my head.

54
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,840
I want to deliver my feelings to you

55
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,840
More than anyone else

56
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,840
Try me, I love you

57
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,840
My love is blooming

58
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,840
Now try me, even if my sad feelings disappear

59
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,840
Yes, try me, I'm looking at you

60
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,840
Believe in me

61
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,840
Try me, tomorrow is different

62
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,840
It's all about deciding.

63
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,840
Thank you very much!

64
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,840
What a wonderful dance!

65
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,840
Please come over here!

66
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,840
Thank you for coming.

67
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,840
There was also the Amurabu-m.

68
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,840
Yes.

69
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,840
What do you think about it?

70
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,840
At the Amurabu-m, I really don't know.

71
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,840
You say that to yourself?

72
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,840
Yes, sometimes. I say that to myself when I'm talking to Monkeys.

73
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,840
Super Monkeys?

74
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,840
Super Monkeys?

75
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,840
You have to put Super.

76
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,840
If you don't put Super, it changes the meaning.

77
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,840
Today, we have a friend from the Komuro family.

78
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,840
Where were you? What are you doing?

79
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,840
This is fun!

80
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,840
I haven't said anything yet.

81
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,840
Where were you?

82
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,840
What were you doing? This is fun!

83
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,840
Come here.

84
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,840
Then, you should go.

85
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,840
This is fun.

86
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,840
This is fun.

87
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,840
This is fun.

88
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,840
Thank you very much.

89
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,840
Next is the first one.

90
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,840
A beautiful fairy who came to Japan.

91
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,840
Agnes-chan's Hina-geshi no Hana.

92
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,840
It's great. It's in the 70's.

93
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,840
Is this okay?

94
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,840
It's not okay.

95
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,840
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,840
No, no, this is no good.

97
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,840
This is just the three of us. Let's go.

98
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,840
This is just a little short-circuited.

99
00:07:07,840 --> 00:06:57,840
Let's go with the

100
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:07,760
This is already a little crying...

101
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:17,080
Shake shake

102
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:27,080
Love's feelings overflowed in my chest

103
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:38,080
Love's tears spilled out today too

104
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,080
I remember it. I remember it.

105
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,080
Thank you very much.

106
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,080
It was fun.

107
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,080
How was it? Please sing.

108
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:51,080
I have learned a lot of Japanese.

109
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,080
She has learned a lot.

110
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,080
Just a little.

111
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,080
Where are you from?

112
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,080
Hong Kong.

113
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,080
Hong Kong.

114
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,080
She has a great sense of Egypt.

115
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,080
She has a great sense of Egypt.

116
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,080
I haven't been to Egypt yet.

117
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,080
You are from Hong Kong, right?

118
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,080
Yes.

119
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,080
Ah... Don't turn around.

120
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,080
I never turn around.

121
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,080
You never turn around.

122
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,080
It's because of Serah.

123
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,080
You turn around immediately.

124
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,080
You're a genius.

125
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,080
That was Serah. Thank you very much.

126
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,080
Next is the mouth-to-mouth singer.

127
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:41,680
That Koizumi Junichiro is also a big fan of the Japanese monster visual K-band, Mano Jishite.

128
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,680
X-Japan's Kurenai.

129
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,080
What's going on?

130
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,080
I'm a little shocked.

131
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,080
This is amazing.

132
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,080
It's really shocking.

133
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,080
I thought I was going to faint.

134
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,080
I'm a little shocked.

135
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,080
It's a story. It's a story.

136
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,080
Really.

137
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,080
It's good.

138
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,080
It's good.

139
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,080
It's good.

140
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,080
It's good.

141
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,080
I'll meet you again

142
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,080
Chocolates, chocolate, more chocolate

143
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,080
I'll be with you

144
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,080
We'll find the way

145
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
E

146
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,080
E E E E E E

147
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,080
It's good, it's good.

148
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,080
It's just a croquette.

149
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,080
It's good.

150
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,080
It's good.

151
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,080
It's not better than the end of action.

152
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,080
It's good.

153
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,080
It's good.

154
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,080
It's great.

155
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,080
The end

156
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,080
Thank you very much

157
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,080
It was wonderful

158
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,080
Thank you very much

159
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,080
Suddenly, it became intense

160
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,080
The way he shook his head suddenly became intense

161
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,080
I did it as usual

162
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,080
Is that so?

163
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,080
Today, you are alone

164
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,080
Yes, I have a neck injury

165
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,080
I see

166
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,080
Is your neck okay, Yoshiki-san?

167
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,080
It's okay

168
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,080
I think it's okay to use it.

169
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,080
What?

170
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,080
It slipped perfectly.

171
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,080
It slipped from the top.

172
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,080
It slipped.

173
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,080
Toshihisa, there is no such thing as slipping.

174
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,080
There is no such thing as slipping in a regional K-band.

175
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,080
How was it, Monza-san? X Japan.

176
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,080
Why was it called?

177
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,080
At one time, I didn't like it.

178
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,080
Hey, hey, hey.

179
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,080
Hey, Kousaka!

180
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,080
No, no, no, it's different.

181
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,080
I'm not sure if I can say this.

182
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,080
This is the first time I'm singing this song.

183
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,080
That's not true.

184
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,080
It's Toshi's song.

185
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,080
It's Toshi's song.

186
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,080
It's not the first time.

187
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,080
I don't know Toshi.

188
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,080
I've been looking up a lot of things, but I haven't found it.

189
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,080
I don't know at all.

190
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:54,180
hahahahahahaha

191
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,700
It's dispatching singer

192
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:53,420
certain charisma of the young manенко

193
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,620
Causing young fall into the destruction RJ

194
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,780
that which leads the youth from the performance

195
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:03,700
OZAKI UTAKA's Night of the didgeridoo

196
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,600
Next is

197
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,340
came out of an amateur

198
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:28,340
I'm looking at the textbook and the outside world

199
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:42,340
I'm looking at the door of my heart without a door

200
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,340
I don't want to.

201
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,340
I know.

202
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,340
There is no escape if you are found.

203
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:55,340
Crouch and lean back.

204
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,340
I can't laugh.

205
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,340
If you understand the secret of the heart,

206
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,340
Adults will look at you.

207
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:10,340
And tonight, your friends will make plans at home.

208
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:19,340
I don't want to go home at school

209
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:24,340
I don't even know what my existence is

210
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,340
I'm trembling

211
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:31,340
I'm going to move

212
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:39,340
I'm going to start running with a stolen microphone

213
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,340
I'm sorry, everyone.

214
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,340
No, no, no.

215
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:48,340
To the back of the cage of the dark night.

216
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,340
That's good. That's good.

217
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:54,340
I don't want to be tied up by anyone.

218
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,340
On this night when I ran away,

219
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,340
I felt free.

220
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,340
On the night of the 15th.

221
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,340
The winner is...

222
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,340
Congratulations!

223
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,340
Ozaki-san, congratulations!

224
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,340
Congratulations, Ozaki-san!

225
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,340
We have a question.

226
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,340
Ozaki-san, what is your current role?

227
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,340
My role?

228
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,340
Yes.

229
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,340
I'm a woman.

230
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,340
A woman?

231
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,340
Yes.

232
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,340
You're a woman, but you're not a woman.

233
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,340
When I'm with her, I can write a lot of things.

234
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,340
Ah, I see.

235
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,340
You can write new things by being with a woman.

236
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,340
That's right.

237
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,340
That's important.

238
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:35,340
Mr. Ozaki, where were you when you were 15?

239
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:39,340
I was in Naples, Italy.

240
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,340
Who are you talking about?

241
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,340
You were in Naples?

242
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,340
Yes.

243
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,340
In Japan?

244
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,340
Yes.

245
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:50,340
You were in Naples when you were 15 and broke the window of the school building.

246
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,340
Did you write that in Naples?

247
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,340
Yes, I know it well.

248
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,340
Did you write it in Naples?

249
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:58,340
Actually, I did it to steal a motorcycle or a car.

250
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,340
He stole a bike in Napoli.

251
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,340
Napoli?

252
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,840
He stole a bike in Napoli.

253
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,840
He's a thief!

254
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,840
He's talking about something really weird.

255
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,840
What?

256
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,840
It was a joke.

257
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,840
It was a joke!

258
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,840
That was a joke!

259
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,840
It was a joke that made Ozaki-san cry.

260
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,840
That was Ozaki Yutaka-san. Thank you very much.

261
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,840
This is a famous mouth-to-mouth singer.

262
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,840
He's the king of comedians in Japan.

263
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,840
With this song, he makes people smile and happy all over Japan.

264
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,840
Ueki Hitoshi's Suudarabushi

265
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,840
Eh?

266
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,840
I can't believe it

267
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,840
That's amazing

268
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,840
This is not good

269
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,840
It's not good

270
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,840
Even if you're going to get drunk

271
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,840
You can't make it in time

272
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,600
earthworm

273
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:35,600
Sui sui sui dararatta sui sui

274
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,600
and that's it.

275
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,600
That was great!

276
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,600
Thank you!

277
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
That was great.

278
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
That was the second round.

279
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,600
The second round?

280
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
He was singing, right?

281
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,600
He was singing, right?

282
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
It felt like he was singing.

283
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
It was a pretty good synchronization.

284
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Zabuki-san, who was the member that you got along with the best among the Crazy Cats?

285
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
No, no, no.

286
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Mike.

287
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
Suddenly, I started sweating.

288
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,600
It was a pretty good expression.

289
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,600
Donato.

290
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,600
An unexpected person appeared.

291
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,600
Now, finally, the last scene.

292
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:32,600
The treasure of Japanese music, who is always challenging the field of new music without being trapped in the circle of enka.

293
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,600
Mori Shinichi's mother.

294
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,600
She has a good face.

295
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
Good face, good face.

296
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,600
No, no, keep it that way.

297
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
Keep it, keep it.

298
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,600
I'm asking you, it's the last one.

299
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,600
Seriously.

300
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:06,600
Mother, mother,

301
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,600
I look up at the sky.

302
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,600
I look up at the sky.

303
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,600
When it rains, I become an umbrella.

304
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:29,600
Someday you will become the umbrella of the world

305
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,600
Please tell me

306
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:43,600
The truth that I will never know

307
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
I don't know.

308
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
Good, good.

309
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
Good, good.

310
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,600
Wonderful.

311
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Thank you very much.

312
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Thank you very much.

313
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
Where do you usually hang out?

314
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,600
I hang out?

315
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,600
I hang out with golf, and watch movies.

316
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,600
I think I have many hobbies.

317
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,600
What are you into the most now?

318
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
Well, I guess...

319
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
I guess it's a gym.

320
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
A gym?

321
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
You can't fool me.

322
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,600
You can't fool me.

323
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,600
What?

324
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,600
You can't fool me?

325
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,600
No, no, no.

326
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
Let's talk about hobbies.

327
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,600
Who do you go golfing with?

328
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
I have many old friends.

329
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,600
I go to sushi restaurants.

330
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
You go to sushi restaurants?

331
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
No, I don't have any celebrities.

332
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,600
Oh, really?

333
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,600
I'm just a fool.

334
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,600
Where do you live?

335
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,600
Can I ask? Where do you live?

336
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,600
On TV.

337
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
I live in Setagaya.

338
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,600
You're a fool.

339
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,600
You're a fool.

340
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,600
I'm not a fool.

341
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,600
You don't have to be a fool.

342
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,600
What's your motto?

343
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,600
My motto is,

344
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,600
I'll do my best.

345
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,600
Are you a fool?

346
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,600
I'm not praising him.

347
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,600
He's a hard-working man.

348
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,600
He's a great man.

349
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,600
He's the best.

350
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,600
The song of all the mouth-to-mouth artists is over.

351
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,600
Who will win the crown?

352
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,600
Now, the winner will be announced.

353
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,600
The winner?

354
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,600
The winner is Yutaka Ozaki.

355
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,600
Congratulations!

356
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Thank you!

357
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,600
Ozaki-san, you won the award, but how do you feel now?

358
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,600
I'm quite moved.

359
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,600
He's moved.

360
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,600
It's not like he won the award.

361
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,600
I want to hear it again.

362
00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:00,600
This time, the winner, Ozaki Itaka-san, will sing a live song.

363
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,600
Please give him a round of applause.

364
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,600
Thank you.

365
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,600
Now, it's 15th night with Ozaki Yutaka.

366
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,600
J church

367
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,480
What a stupidity

368
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,480
I'm watching a dream that can't be reached in the sky far away

369
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:48,480
I want to be a hero who has no place to go

370
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,480
I want to be a hero who has no place to go

371
