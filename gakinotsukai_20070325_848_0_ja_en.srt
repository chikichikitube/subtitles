1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Are you wearing a jacket again?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Yes.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What is this?

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You bought a jacket and a jean.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm wearing a jacket now.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I heard that this is a suit.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You only wore it once.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It was a while ago.

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Wait! Wait!

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I was surprised.

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I said that I was surprised.

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's okay.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Don't say that you won.

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Good morning.

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Good morning.

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Good morning.

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Good morning.

18
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Good morning.

19
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You should go.

20
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,500
Yes.

21
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,500
We're all here for a meeting.

22
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,000
Yes, I know.

23
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,500
That's why I came today.

24
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,500
It's a new format for the show.

25
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,500
You should have done it behind the scenes with only Suga.

26
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,000
But I can't ignore you guys.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Why do you come with your family?

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Because we're family.

29
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The girl is also not growing up at all.

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
She's gotten smaller.

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
She's still cute.

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
She's cute.

33
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
She's still cute.

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
She's still cute.

35
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
They're making love.

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
They're making love.

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
She's cute. She's cute.

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
She's really cute.

39
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Who are you?

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Today, we thought about the format of the show.

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Today, everyone is not moving around much.

42
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Last time was tough.

43
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I feel sorry for that.

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Oh!

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The whistle has been blown.

46
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Oh! It seems that Yamazaki-san has got a red card.

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Why?

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I think that was not aggressive enough.

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What?

50
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You are fired from the game.

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You were dancing.

52
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
When did you learn to dance?

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
This time I did it with a talk-based feeling.

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's really easy.

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This is revolutionary.

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I think that Hamada-san can do this.

57
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Really?

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Hamada can do it?

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
He can do it.

60
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
He is already done.

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Ah, he is already done.

62
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Because the package is already messed up.

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
If you sit down, you'll get used to it.

64
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I can't do that.

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You can.

66
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
If I just sit down, I'll get used to it.

67
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Well, that's not a problem.

68
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Is it okay?

69
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But it'll take a while.

70
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It won't take that long?

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yes.

72
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm going to do the 500th episode of Sugakendji.

73
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
No, no, no.

74
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't want to know.

75
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Please buy it.

76
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:54,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

77
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Life is like a race, no matter how you look at it.

78
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's a music video.

79
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's true.

80
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's true.

81
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Oh, that's...

82
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
This program is a program that shows the life of various people.

83
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I would like to introduce the first final guest.

84
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's Itao's wife.

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What?

86
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's a wife.

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What?

88
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
She's a great woman.

89
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
She's the best partner for Shimo Furino.

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
She's a good partner.

91
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's Itao's wife.

92
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Welcome to our show today.

93
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's too close.

94
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Now, let's look back on the life of Itao's wife.

95
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What do you mean?

96
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I don't really know.

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That's just a VHS video deck.

98
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Today we will be looking back at this tape.

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
There is even a 7th note?

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Let's first look at the video of the life of a basic person.

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
This time lag is amazing.

102
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Now, please watch the video.

103
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:44,000
In the 1970s, a woman born in the northwest of India was raised with a strict father and a kind mother.

104
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The woman was 9 or 10 years old.

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You have seen the whole world, but you can not see it.

106
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You can not see it.

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You can not see it.

108
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Why not?

109
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Because it's the first time.

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Who is who?

111
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Who is who?

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What's going on?

114
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So, this is how the show starts.

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What do you think, Endo?

116
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
To be honest, I didn't know who was who,

117
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
and they didn't translate it into Japanese, so I didn't understand the meaning.

118
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Well, it's a realistic reproduction.

119
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You should have done it more carefully.

120
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Today, we prepared a snack that everyone ate on their wives' birthdays.

121
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Oh, that was on the screen.

122
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It was in the hand.

123
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
We prepared a snack for you.

124
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'll give it to everyone.

125
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
...

126
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's the real one.

127
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Isn't there something more to it?

128
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Something like that.

129
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Like the paper.

130
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's wrapped.

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's unhygienic.

132
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's unhygienic.

133
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
This is actually the same as the naan we ate in the video.

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm looking at you with a lot of thought.

135
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The member of the club is crying.

136
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What are you looking at?

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
He was crying when he was a member of the club.

138
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What is that face?

139
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Originally, one ticket costs 1500 yen, but today it costs 1300 yen.

140
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That's expensive.

141
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
One ticket costs 1300 yen.

142
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You don't need that, right?

143
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I don't need that.

144
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But I touched it, so I can't help it.

145
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You touched it and then gave it to him.

146
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
If you do that, you'll get in trouble.

147
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
We'll move on to the next video.

148
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
After this, something terrible will happen to Yome.

149
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
When the time comes, the girl who is interested in him appears.

150
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Which one should I read?

151
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You read this one.

152
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Please forgive me.

153
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
No problem.

154
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Please forgive me.

155
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Actually, the classes are going on for so long.

156
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I have to wait for you to go.

157
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
No problem. Please sit.

158
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I want to tell you something.

159
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yes.

160
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I like you very much.

161
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Oh, really?

162
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And...

163
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Is this for me?

164
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
This is for you.

165
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Oh, really?

166
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Please take it.

167
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Okay, there is one thing. I will tell you too.

168
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Really?

169
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The first love was confessed to by the bride, and they decided to date.

170
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm so excited.

171
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It was a big deal.

172
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What do you think, Endo?

173
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Looking at the situation...

174
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I don't know why it turned out like that.

175
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The comments...

176
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

177
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I don't know either.

178
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
He confessed his love for the first time and got accepted.

179
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
That's right.

180
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I don't know why it turned out like that.

181
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Today...

182
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Today, we have a batting match.

183
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
He brought a bat.

184
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I know, I know.

185
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I know this.

186
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I know this.

187
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
This is the bat.

188
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
This is the normal color bat.

189
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Endo, what do you think?

190
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What do I think?

191
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You can tell the feeling.

192
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
How about hitting it on your body?

193
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Do you hit it?

194
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Like this, don don don don

195
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm hitting it

196
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Well, it's not extravagant

197
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:51,000
This time, we asked the bat maker to prepare a bat with your names on it

198
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
This is the bat with your names on it

199
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Each of them has a name

200
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The colors are chosen by us.

201
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
We can't write it with magic.

202
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
We can't write it with special kanji.

203
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Endo is that color.

204
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
But this is not Endo.

205
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's the real one.

206
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
We have named it specially for the production.

207
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's 5 books, so it's 15,000 yen.

208
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
No, I don't need it.

209
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't need it.

210
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Well, I've already given you a name, so it's not a problem.

211
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yes, thank you.

212
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Now, after this, there will be many different weather in the life of a bride.

213
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Please watch this video.

214
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So, before I say it...

215
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
What is this?

216
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's good to be in this video.

217
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's already short.

218
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
She has a skill to summarize many stories of the Gappe.

219
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
She was hired as a first-class winner.

220
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's like a movie.

221
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Suddenly?

222
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
There are two of them, right?

223
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
There are two of them?

224
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
There are two of them.

225
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Why are there two?

226
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm not crying. I'm flying.

227
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's over.

228
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Now, we've been through a tough trial. How was it, Endo?

229
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I don't know at all.

230
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It was a tough trial.

231
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Especially now.

232
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I think it was a time when they had to stop working at the company.

233
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It was in Tokyo.

234
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
In Tokyo?

235
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
In Tokyo, the employees were in Japan.

236
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I didn't know that.

237
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
When they were working at the company,

238
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
two documents came to the company,

239
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
and the trial was held.

240
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
However, there were no such sad events.

241
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Please look at this.

242
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm saying that but...

243
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
If you could watch a single video, it would be that short.

244
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It would be 60 minutes long.

245
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That's all.

246
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
After this, the weather will change for the bride who has tasted the bottom of life.

247
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I saw this earlier.

248
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You saw it?

249
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,500
Can I make another plate..?

250
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,980
Lets try with this one we made before..

251
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,900
No no.

252
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,840
Just like that we have continued to compete..

253
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:01,800
That was..

254
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,560
I really Are happy with this

255
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,720
so what is your reply Endo

256
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,700
No way I am totally sailed

257
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,180
How about Chiaki?

258
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,180
What would be a potential attitude in Chiaki

259
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,700
aso who'd it be? delivered by Chiaki?

260
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,540
Why are you looking at the tapes?

261
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:34,540
What kind of material do you compare Akira with?

262
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,540
What kind of material do you think he wears?

263
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,540
I don't know.

264
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,540
That's how extraordinary his life is.

265
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:49,540
Now, finally, the cruel fate awaits his wife.

266
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,540
Not yet?

267
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:56,540
The story of the first love

268
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:03,540
In the late 1990s, a cruel fate awaits for the bride.

269
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,540
I'm sure you've heard it before.

270
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,540
This is like a scene from a movie.

271
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,540
I don't like it.

272
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,540
It's a scene from a movie.

273
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,540
This is...

274
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,540
It's a play.

275
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,540
It's a play.

276
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,540
There is no substitute for that.

277
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,540
I'm not going to do it at all.

278
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,540
I'm still not ready.

279
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,540
I'm not ready for the end.

280
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,540
You're angry.

281
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,540
She's gone.

282
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,540
She's gone.

283
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,540
It's over.

284
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:30,540
How about this mischief of a wife's favorite fate?

285
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,540
First of all, may I ask a question?

286
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,540
Did you go to war?

287
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,540
Yes, I went to war as a Japanese soldier.

288
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,540
As a Japanese soldier? You're an Indian, right?

289
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,540
Well, in those days, I was in a mess in the war.

290
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:50,540
Everyone was excited about the bubble.

291
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,540
I don't know whose post it is or whose paper it is.

292
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,540
It's better to be bold.

293
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,540
That's why I said it honestly.

294
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:05,540
Now, it's the shopping corner of the bride that everyone has been waiting for.

295
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,540
Please bring it.

296
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,540
What is the shopping corner now?

297
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,540
Yes, it is.

298
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:14,540
Yes, this time it is here.

299
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,540
Yes, it is the color gunte of the bride.

300
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,540
I've never seen one before.

301
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,540
In the middle of the night.

302
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,540
There was a war, so you couldn't miss the military service.

303
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:31,540
It's just the military, but I didn't do the military service in the war.

304
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:36,540
This is the color of the cell phone that Yome chose.

305
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:40,540
If you like it, you can order it.

306
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,540
I'll give you a discount later.

307
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,540
No, I'm sorry.

308
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,540
Please take your order.

309
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,540
This year is especially hard.

310
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,540
Yes, it is.

311
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,540
Everyone, there is one sheet each.

312
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:57,540
Please draw a line where you like the color.

313
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,540
A number of sheets?

314
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,540
Please change it.

315
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,540
No, it's okay.

316
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,540
Then I'll do it.

317
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,540
Let's do it.

318
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,540
I'll find it.

319
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,540
Yes, I understand.

320
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,540
I really don't understand.

321
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,540
The quality of the military service.

322
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,540
Please put it on.

323
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:21,540
No, no, no. I've never said the quality of the military service.

324
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,540
Why do I have to buy a military service here?

325
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,540
I don't understand at all.

326
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,540
Now, I'd like to go back to the program.

327
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:33,540
After this, the bride will finally arrive.

328
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,540
What?

329
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:39,540
Please see the bride after the movie.

330
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,540
I didn't know that.

331
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:49,540
This time, I couldn't make it in time for editing, so I'll be the narrator.

332
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,540
Excuse me.

333
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,540
Go ahead.

334
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,540
Why didn't you make it in time?

335
00:18:55,540 --> 00:19:08,540
The wife who gained various experiences after that has finally come to Japan.

336
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,540
She has been doing many different jobs.

337
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:17,540
Among them, the first job she got was the second one in the TV station.

338
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,540
No, no, no. The way you say second is strange.

339
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:25,540
I think it's a given.

340
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:36,540
Furthermore, from the second day, she was able to get a beautiful transformation.

341
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:45,540
After that, the woman who was praised for her excellent technique as a makeup artist, suddenly became a trendier drama director.

342
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:53,540
After I achieved a great success, I met Itao by chance.

343
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,540
And finally...

344
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,540
This is Itao.

345
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,540
He suddenly appeared in the middle of the production.

346
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,540
Wow, wow, wow!

347
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,540
Amazing!

348
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,540
Huh?

349
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,540
Yes.

350
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,540
Did you take it from above?

351
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,540
I took it from above.

352
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,540
I'm sorry.

353
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:39,540
I changed my life after the next day.

354
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,540
Endo, how was it?

355
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,540
You came to Japan, right?

356
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:47,540
Yes, I came to Japan and got a second job.

357
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,540
What is a second job?

358
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,540
It's okay to be a cameraman, right?

359
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,540
Well, I was doing my second job professionally.

360
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:57,540
And it was very popular, so I was given a big discount on my makeup.

361
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,540
That's strange.

362
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:05,540
That's the fate of Itao's wife.

363
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,540
How about starting from day 2 and doing makeup?

364
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:12,540
You've been doing makeup until today, but starting tomorrow you'll do makeup.

365
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:16,540
If it were me, I'd be like...

366
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,540
What would you do the day before?

367
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,540
You've been doing makeup since day 2, but starting tomorrow you'll do makeup.

368
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,540
What would you do the night before?

369
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,540
Is it your turn?

370
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,540
What should I do?

371
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,540
You'll be surprised, right?

372
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,540
You'll be surprised again?

373
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,540
I'll be surprised.

374
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,540
I'll be surprised again.

375
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,540
Now, let's have the beautiful

376
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,540
Nikabe Saba-ki

377
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,540
to show us.

378
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,540
And then we'll say goodbye to the show.

379
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,540
And then we'll say goodbye to the show.

380
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,540
Beautiful

381
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,540
I'm Sadaqui.

382
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,540
I'm sorry.

383
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,540
Thank you very much.

384
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,540
That's all.

385
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,540
The program.

386
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,540
Is Mr. Tsutsuga here?

387
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,540
It's like this.

388
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,040
Yes.

389
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,040
There is such a program?

390
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,540
There is.

391
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,040
Yes.

392
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,540
Mr. Tomi is doing it in the morning.

393
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,540
That's right.

394
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,040
Well then, about 1 million yen.

395
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,540
Eh? How much?

396
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,540
About 1 million yen.

397
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,040
Yes.

398
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:03,040
Well, of course, the Bunta, the Karabata, the Nan, all of them are included.

399
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,540
Yes.

400
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,040
Including all of them.

401
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,040
I think 1 million yen is too cheap.

402
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,540
Yes.

403
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,540
It's fine if you use it as it is.

404
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,540
This is also made properly, so I think it's very easy for Hamada-san.

405
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,040
Yes.

406
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,040
It's not a hammer.

407
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,040
It's not a hammer.

408
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,040
It's not a hammer.

409
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,040
Well, well, then, for the time being,

410
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,040
the board, really,

411
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,040
let's consider it.

412
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,040
Well, then, for the time being, for the time being,

413
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,040
in the first place,

414
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,040
please keep it.

415
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,040
Please keep the money.

416
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,040
Mr. Tsuda, too.

417
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,040
I have to pay for the technical expenses.

418
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,040
If there is any left over, I will bring it.

419
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,040
Then, please,

420
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,040
I'll do that.

421
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,040
Let's go.

422
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,040
Excuse me.

423
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,040
Thank you.

424
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,040
Thank you.

425
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,040
This is terrible.

426
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,040
We have to change the recording date.

427
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,040
This one?

428
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,040
This program was brought to you by the following sponsors.
