1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The night's Kuchipaku hit studio, the second half of the show!

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The members of the second half have gathered together to perform a performance of incredible synchrony!

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Good, good, good!

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Over-reacting!

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The mouth pack's monster has appeared again tonight!

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Who will be the winner?

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Tonight, the winner will be decided!

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Let's move on to the next mouth pack singer.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Let's hear it! The hit song that was a huge hit by chance, the masterpiece that became a social phenomenon, tonight, the first time to reveal it, Mr. Shimon Masato's, Swim, Taiyaki-kun!

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Well, it's because it's sold.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,500
CEO vanity

12
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,500
carrier

13
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,500
He doesn't Multi-use

14
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,000
Hello

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What a surprise

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Just like this?!

17
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,000
Your V-shape just happens to look like this.

18
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,500
Your V-shape just happens to look like this.

19
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,500
Thank you!

20
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,500
Thank you very much!

21
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,500
Thank you very much!

22
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,500
You are a very popular kid, Taikichi.

23
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:32,500
I think there are many businesses where children are in.

24
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,500
What was the hardest business you did?

25
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,500
Children are surprisingly big.

26
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,500
You're not a 5th grader?

27
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,500
Well...

28
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,500
You know...

29
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,500
I know

30
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,500
What's wrong?

31
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
Middle school?

32
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,500
Middle school?

33
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,500
I'm just starting

34
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,500
What?

35
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
You're only 15 or 16?

36
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,500
15 or 16...

37
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,500
I wait everyday

38
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,500
You wait everyday?

39
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,500
Everyday

40
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,500
The hairstyle is a little impressive.

41
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,500
Do you have any manners?

42
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,500
This is...

43
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Zack Baran.

44
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,500
Zack Baran?

45
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,500
The sound is different.

46
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,500
Zack Baran.

47
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,500
Thank you very much.

48
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,500
Let's move on to the next one.

49
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:34,500
The Date men who have been time-slipping since the 3rd year of Genroku are coming to Edo tonight.

50
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Kuroizaki with rock, Oedo with kabuki rock.

51
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,600
Oh

52
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,480
What a poem

53
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,480
Yep, it's a true story.

54
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,940
mÃ³wn

55
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,460
It's like that guy's song.

56
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,360
wow

57
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,360
It's so cool.

58
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,360
So cool.

59
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,740
I'm notlla

60
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:46,700
A fair ranked hero

61
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,700
Oh, eh, no!

62
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,700
A town where a girl sleeps

63
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,700
Oh, eh, no!

64
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:01,700
The moe-do flies into the night

65
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,700
Even though I have a bad back

66
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,700
Thank you very much

67
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,700
Thank you very much

68
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:21,700
You have been a time-slip since the year of the dog, but do you have any problems in your current life?

69
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:26,700
At first, if I say that I had a problem, it would be a lie, but now I'm used to it.

70
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:31,700
If you say that you didn't have a problem, it would be a lie.

71
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:38,700
Speaking of Mr. Rokus, you are from Ikaten, but which band did you think was the most rival at that time?

72
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,700
Ah, it's from Begin.

73
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,700
Ah, that's true.

74
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,700
I was also like Begin at first.

75
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,700
Eh?

76
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,700
But when Ikaten came out, it wasn't like this anymore?

77
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,700
I thought it was different.

78
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,700
Ah, is that so?

79
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:59,700
Everyone was interested in the Genroku era, so I think that's why it became like this.

80
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,700
So, you've been time-slipping for three years?

81
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,700
Yes.

82
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,700
Sorry, what's going on now?

83
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,700
What is going on? I'm sorry.

84
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,700
I'm sorry. What's going on?

85
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,700
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,700
It was a wonderful performance.

87
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,700
Thank you very much.

88
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,700
Thank you very much.

89
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,700
It was wonderful.

90
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,700
Let's move on to the next mouth-to-mouth singer.

91
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,700
A big star of the group sounds era.

92
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,700
He appeared with a polished look.

93
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,700
Kenji Sawada's Slipper

94
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,700
It's a little similar

95
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,700
Why is it always like this?

96
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,700
I'm the winner!

97
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:34,700
I'll show you everything

98
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:41,700
I want to see everything of you

99
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,700
Oh, that's good

100
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,700
What's that?

101
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,700
Thank you very much

102
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,700
That was wonderful

103
00:07:53,700 --> 00:08:00,700
When you were working as Kouhaku's bird, you said you refused to be a bird at first.

104
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,700
I basically hate birds.

105
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,700
Oh, really? Why?

106
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,700
The last one is sad.

107
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,700
How far has your voice reached now?

108
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,700
Not at all.

109
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,700
How about you, Shibata?

110
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,700
It's so close.

111
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,700
It's not close. I can't hear it at all from my side.

112
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,700
You can't hear it at all?

113
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,700
I can't hear it at all.

114
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:27,700
You covered Tokyo, and you were on Kabuki Rocks. How was it?

115
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,700
I've never met him before.

116
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,700
Oh, really?

117
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,700
So you didn't say anything about it?

118
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,700
I didn't get permission.

119
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,700
You didn't get permission?

120
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,700
Is it okay for me to sing?

121
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,700
Well, then...

122
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,700
What's that?

123
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,700
What's that?

124
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,700
What's that?

125
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,700
Thank you Sasuke-san!

126
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,700
Thank you!

127
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,700
Let's move on to the next mouth-to-mouth singer.

128
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,700
The national big brother, sorry to keep you waiting.

129
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:59,700
The ideal sister of the Japanese people will sing a song with a sweet voice.

130
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,700
Matsumoto Yuya's Sentimental Journey.

131
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,700
It's definitely him.

132
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,700
See? It's definitely him.

133
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,700
Cute.

134
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,700
I'm hungry...

135
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,700
I'm hungry...

136
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,700
I'm hungry...

137
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,700
I'm hungry...

138
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,700
I've been practicing this so much!

139
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,700
Like a magazine that's thrown away

140
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:43,700
Every time my page turns, you dig it out

141
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,700
I wonder if you know? I want to know

142
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:56,700
I'm traveling deep into your eyes

143
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:02,700
My sentimental journey

144
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:08,700
I want to dream as I am

145
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,700
I want to be with you

146
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,700
Yama-chan, you're serious this time?

147
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,700
I want to tell you

148
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:24,700
Because I'm still 16

149
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:38,700
I was invited by something, I was taken by you, It's not a sentiment

150
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,700
Thank you very much!

151
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,700
Thank you very much.

152
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,700
Thank you very much.

153
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,700
Thank you very much.

154
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,700
I was a little nervous.

155
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,700
Everyone is laughing.

156
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:05,700
Speaking of Iho, you were scouted in Harajuku.

157
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,700
What did you do in Harajuku?

158
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:15,700
I loved to see the bamboo family in Harajuku.

159
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,700
You went to see it.

160
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,700
Yes.

161
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,700
And then...

162
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,700
And then?

163
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,700
And then?

164
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,700
And then...

165
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,700
Was he from Kansai?

166
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,700
I was very close to Madoka-san.

167
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,700
You're a bit different.

168
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,700
I'm different.

169
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,700
I've always been from Kansai.

170
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,700
When did you first meet Hiromi-san?

171
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,700
I'll get scolded by Hiromi-san.

172
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,700
It's been decades. Please stop that.

173
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,200
No, no, no.

174
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,200
You'll get scolded.

175
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
You'll get scolded.

176
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,200
You'll get scolded.

177
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,200
What's the word for Hirobis' proposal?

178
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,200
Ah, that's right.

179
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,200
That is...

180
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,200
Yun Kai.

181
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,200
In Osaka, at Nakano-shima...

182
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,700
Nakano-shima?

183
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,200
At the festival hall.

184
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,200
At Madoka-san's concert...

185
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,200
He did it.

186
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,200
He did it.

187
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,200
He did it.

188
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,200
At that time.

189
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
When I went to greet him...

190
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
And then Madoka-san said,

191
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,200
I don't want to propose to you.

192
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,200
And she said to me,

193
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,200
No, that's not right.

194
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,200
It's not me.

195
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,200
It's Kiyomi-san's.

196
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,200
It's not me.

197
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
There was such a thing.

198
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
And we got married.

199
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,200
No, no.

200
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
There was such a thing in the dressing room.

201
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,200
Oh, my God.

202
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,200
After this, the winner of the contest will continue to appear!

203
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,200
Now, let's move on to the next mouth-closing singer.

204
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:55,200
The son of the Fouke family has appeared in the mouth-closing hit studio.

205
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,200
Masashi Sada will announce his retirement.

206
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:03,200
Eh, Sada-san?

207
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
This is bad.

208
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
If you let him do this, he'll...

209
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,200
This is bad.

210
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:21,200
I want to tell you before I get married.

211
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
Don't make a voice.

212
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:34,200
I'll talk to you, but listen to my voice.

213
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:39,200
You can't sleep before me.

214
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,200
You can't wake up after me.

215
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,200
Make a good meal.

216
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,200
You're always beautiful and colorful.

217
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,200
If you can laugh at me,

218
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,200
Don't forget me.

219
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,200
The woman I love.

220
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,200
The woman I love.

221
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,200
You are the only one in my life

222
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,200
Thank you very much

223
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,200
Thank you very much

224
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:28,200
You are called by your fans and staffs, but what is your real name?

225
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,200
I don't know

226
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
You don't know?

227
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,200
I don't know

228
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,200
I don't know

229
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:42,200
You are close with Mr. Kuramoto, do you go somewhere together?

230
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,200
Yes, I go to Kagoshima recently.

231
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,200
Kagoshima?

232
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,200
Kagoshima and my hometown, Shimai-doshi.

233
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,200
What is your hometown?

234
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,200
I think you don't know, but it's Napoli.

235
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,200
It's not Napoli.

236
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:05,200
Your wife was a former CA. How did you get along with her?

237
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,200
There is a very good hotel in Kagoshima.

238
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,200
There is a good hotel?

239
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,200
Yes, on the hill.

240
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,200
And I asked her if I could kiss her there.

241
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,200
You could kiss her?

242
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,200
Yes.

243
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
And she refused.

244
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
She refused?

245
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,200
Yes.

246
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,200
It may be boring, but it is a very deep memory for me.

247
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,200
I was not able to get a kiss in my life for the first time.

248
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,200
So the first time you were not able to kiss her was when you were a man.

249
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,200
I see.

250
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,200
And then we got married.

251
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,200
Oh, I see.

252
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,200
It was a very loose marriage, but she was the only one who was hard.

253
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,200
There were many things.

254
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,200
Thank you, Masashi Sada.

255
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,200
Please go to the next corner.

256
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,200
Thank you.

257
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,200
Let's move on to the next mouth-to-mouth scene.

258
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,200
A popular kid in elementary school.

259
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,200
A one-shot gag full of humor.

260
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,200
A great success with a bad character.

261
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,200
In Yamazaki Hosei, Yamazaki Ichiban.

262
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,200
Yamazaki Ichiban!

263
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:26,200
Yamazaki Ichiban!

264
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,200
Good morning!

265
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:34,200
Looking at the sun, the stars of Yamazaki

266
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:41,200
Go, Yamazaki, for your own sake

267
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:49,200
Dreams are big, they are the world's most beautiful

268
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:56,200
Aim, Yamazaki, for your own sake

269
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:11,200
Yamada Kikishima!

270
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:20,200
Yamada Kikishima!

271
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,200
It's getting more and more interesting.

272
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,200
Thank you very much.

273
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,200
Thank you very much.

274
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,200
Thank you very much.

275
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
Thank you very much.

276
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,200
This is the main character of the anime, Gakkyou Yamazaki.

277
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,200
What kind of story is this?

278
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,200
Yamazaki. I'm Yamazaki.

279
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,200
I'm Yamazaki, but...

280
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,200
I'm the school principal.

281
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,200
Why did you say that?

282
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,200
You're the one who got dragged.

283
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,200
How was it, Natsukima-san?

284
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,200
Well, I think it was good.

285
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,200
I got to show my energy in the second half.

286
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,200
The first half wasn't interesting at all.

287
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,200
I think it would be good to show a little bit of my speciality in the end.

288
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
That's right.

289
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,200
Of course, we are waiting for the little one.

290
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,200
Lastly, please.

291
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
The new one?

292
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
Oh, no, no.

293
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
The new one?

294
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
Any one is fine.

295
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,200
Please.

296
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,200
We've been doing that recently.

297
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,200
Of course, we've been doing something more appropriate.

298
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,200
He came here and then turned around

299
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,200
Give me your face

300
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,200
What are you doing?

301
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,200
Let's move on to the next scene

302
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,200
A man who is not trapped in the circle of enka

303
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,200
and always challenges himself to the new music field

304
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,200
Shinichi Mori's Kitano Hotaru

305
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:09,200
Morita is definitely a good singer.

306
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,200
He is definitely a good singer.

307
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,200
He always comes to see me.

308
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,200
Good, good!

309
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,200
That's better, I think.

310
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,200
Good, good, good, good.

311
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,200
It's still a bit off-key.

312
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,200
The chorus is coming.

313
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,200
Nice.

314
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,200
Good, good.

315
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,200
Let's do a little bit.

316
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,200
There are parts that we want a little bit more.

317
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,200
Give us a little bit of your face.

318
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,200
A little more.

319
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,200
Good, good.

320
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
Good.

321
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,200
Good face, good face.

322
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,200
What kind of face is that?

323
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,200
Thank you very much!

324
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,200
No, no, Mori-san, you're the first one I've seen.

325
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,200
You have a different style.

326
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,200
It was wonderful. Thank you very much.

327
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,200
Thank you very much.

328
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,200
It seems that Mori-san was scouted by Charlie Ishiguro-san.

329
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,200
What kind of person is Charlie Ishiguro-san?

330
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,200
Charlie is a half.

331
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,200
Is it a half?

332
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,200
I'm a half.

333
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
What is this?

334
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,200
When I was walking down the street, Charlie said,

335
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,200
Yes, he is half English,

336
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,200
and he said things in English, so I can speak a little English.

337
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,200
So I said, OK.

338
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,200
So you are a good singer.

339
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,200
What is the content?

340
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,200
Walking down the street.

341
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
What is the content?

342
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,200
Now all the performance of the mouth-closing singer is over.

343
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,200
The winner is...

344
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,200
Who will win the victory?

345
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,200
Now, the winner is...

346
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,200
The winner is...

347
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,200
Masashi Sada!

348
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:26,200
The winner is...

349
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,200
The winner is...

350
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,200
The winner is...

351
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,200
I'm so happy

352
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,200
Congratulations

353
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,200
A reward for the winner of the mouth-clap festival, a live performance

354
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,200
The song is Sada Masashi's song of gratitude.

355
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:02,200
Before I get married, I have something to tell you.

356
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,200
It's a pretty tough story.

357
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:14,200
Listen to my true feelings, and wake up

358
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:20,200
I'm not a river

359
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:26,200
Don't forget me

360
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:31,200
The woman who loves me

361
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:37,200
Loving women is when you love your own life.

362
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,200
Don't forget that.

363
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,200
Loving women is when you love...

364
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,200
Loving women is when you...

365
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,200
...love one person, just one person...

366
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,200
Thank you.

367
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,200
Thank you very much.
