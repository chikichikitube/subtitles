1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
I'm tired.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It's cold today.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's cold today.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It's hot today.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's hot today.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Really?

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sweating.

8
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Really?

9
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Really.

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Again?

11
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Again?

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Again?

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Again?

14
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Again?

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's hot.

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Who is it?

17
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
No, no, no.

18
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Thank you.

19
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Thank you.

20
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Go!

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Congratulations!

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What are you doing?

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Hurry up and hand it over!

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Why are you so cool?

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What is this?

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Hamada-san.

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I heard that it's your birthday today, so I brought you a present.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
No, no, no, that's not necessary.

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Please accept it.

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
No, no, no, no.

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I won't accept it.

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
No, no, no, no.

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I won't accept it.

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
No, no, no, no.

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I've already received this before, and it's already become a big deal.

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
No, no, no.

37
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's time for Valentine's Day, right?

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yes.

39
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:33,000
This year's Valentine's Day, Oshima, who confessed his passionate feelings for Hamada and sent a great death, is finally defeated in the end, but this time, Oshima's love for Hamada is burning.

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsor you are watching.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Please take it.

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
No, it's a picture.

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I brought it from Oshima.

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Well, maybe, but...

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I don't like you, dad.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's your birthday after the show.

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I don't like you.

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Shut up, you dumbass!

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Shut up!

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Shut up, you!

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Shut up!

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Hey, hey!

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Hey, hey!

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What? Don't be so loud!

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Shut up!

56
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Hey, hey, hey!

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Stop it! Stop it!

58
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Stop it!

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What are you doing?

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What is this?

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You're making a scene.

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That's enough.

63
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Listen to this.

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Let's eat.

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Let's eat.

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Please accept this.

67
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
That's enough.

68
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

69
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What is this?

70
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Let's eat.

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You guys are so annoying.

72
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The type of woman is different.

73
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
If it's a girl, everyone will eat you.

74
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
If you get angry.

75
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What are you talking about?

76
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
He said many times.

77
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:48,900
He said that he likes a girl who doesn't get hurt even if he puts a

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
quagata in her nose.

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I like a girl who doesn't get hurt.

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Really?

81
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But there is no quagata.

82
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I don't have it.

83
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What's wrong?

84
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What's wrong?

85
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Oh, there's a scary guy!

86
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What?

87
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
He's following us!

88
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We can do this!

89
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You're really something.

90
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You're really something.

91
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
There's a scary guy!

92
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What?

93
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Really?

94
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You're really something.

95
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Wow!

96
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Go!

97
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
He'll definitely turn around.

98
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We can do this!

99
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Are you ready?

100
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Go, go, go!

101
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Go, go, go!

102
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'll go.

103
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Hamada-san.

104
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yes?

105
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Please come out.

106
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What the hell?

107
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
She's crying! She's crying!

108
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
She's crying! She's crying!

109
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You idiot! Where are you going?

110
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Where are you going?

111
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Where are you going?

112
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That's strange.

113
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's not what I meant.

114
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What's going on?

115
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What was that?

116
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I went to the love hotel. I know nothing.

117
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That's what you're saying.

118
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I like fat women.

119
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I don't like middle-aged women.

120
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I don't like them at all.

121
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't like them at all.

122
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I like them more fat.

123
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You know, the balloon that goes in your nose.

124
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I've heard that they say that.

125
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But that's serious.

126
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Even if it's wrong, there's no balloon.

127
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Well, it's a bit sudden. So, I'll do my best next year.

128
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Ah!

129
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Here!

130
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What?

131
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The giant balloon!

132
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's stuck!

133
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I can do it!

134
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's low.

135
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Let's do it!

136
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
This is the giant balloon.

137
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
This is it, right?

138
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The giant balloon.

139
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What?

140
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Everyone, let's eat cake!

141
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'll go right now!

142
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I can do it!

143
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You can do it!

144
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You're cute!

145
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Mr. Kamada!

146
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yes?

147
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Go away!

148
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You are a little...

149
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Wait a minute!

150
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's hot!

151
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What is this?

152
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What is this?

153
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Please go out with me.

154
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Go out?

155
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Wait a minute.

156
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Huh? Why?

157
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
That's not it.

158
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Why?

159
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What?

160
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Why?

161
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Why did you reject me?

162
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Because...

163
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You should have said it after we broke up.

164
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That's right.

165
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You should have said it at the right time.

166
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You should have said it when we were in a good mood.

167
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I didn't.

168
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You should have said it after we broke up.

169
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Nonki?

170
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Oh, yes! I remember!

171
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What?

172
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Hama, you like to be a comedian, don't you?

173
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That's right.

174
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's very simple.

175
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I wonder what it is to be a comedian.

176
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It could be a hip-hop star.

177
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I think he likes it.

178
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He likes it.

179
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I said it to myself.

180
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I like that kind of girl.

181
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I suddenly felt like I liked her.

182
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You liked her?

183
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yes, I liked her.

184
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I liked her even more when she was near my face.

185
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Really?

186
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I heard that.

187
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What is this?

188
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's carbonated water.

189
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I can get it with this.

190
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's leaking.

191
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's low grade.

192
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's leaking.

193
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's yours.

194
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I can get it with this.

195
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Do your best.

196
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
There's everything I want.

197
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Okay.

198
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Good luck.

199
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's your chance.

200
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Good luck.

201
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'll be right in front of you.

202
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Good luck.

203
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'll be right under your screen.

204
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Okay.

205
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Bye bye.

206
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What are you doing?

207
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What are you doing?

208
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You're making me angry!

209
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What are you doing?

210
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What are you doing?

211
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's not coming out well!

212
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You're...

213
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You're not the same as before!

214
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You're not the same as before!

215
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You're not the same as before!

216
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You're not the same as before!

217
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
We have to go to the drama location now.

218
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
We're going home.

219
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
We're not going anywhere today.

220
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm the only one who has nothing to do today.

221
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's right.

222
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Thank you.

223
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Wait a minute. What's going on?

224
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Let's go, Mr. Hamada. Let's go. Let's chase him.

225
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Let's go this far. Let's go.

226
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Let's go to the drama. Let's go.

227
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Really?

228
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Wait a minute.

229
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The person Hamada is going to shoot is the popular drama, Ashi-Tanarusa.

230
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The main character, Hamada, is doing this shoot on a very busy schedule.

231
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
He is showing a serious expression that is different from a smile

232
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
In such a busy filming site, the broadcast special of Thai, Mr. Mori is sneaking in

233
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's the real thing

234
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What are you doing now?

235
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
No no no

236
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Ah, there he is

237
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
There he is

238
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's the real thing

239
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
From now on, it's the real thing

240
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
This is bad

241
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But it's better to go

242
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It can't be helped

243
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm going

244
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Hey, I started eating hot Doria.

245
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Oh, by the way, Hamada-san, you seem to like hot Doria.

246
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And you like it with bare hands, right?

247
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I've heard of it.

248
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Really?

249
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What do you mean? You like hot Doria with bare hands?

250
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I like rough women.

251
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So you like hot Doria?

252
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Lucky! You can do it! Do it!

253
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Do it! You're a drama actor now!

254
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's starting!

255
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's okay, it's okay. Look back, look back.

256
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Oshima!

257
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Hey, hey, how many are you going to do?

258
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Hey, hey, let's go.

259
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
This is serious. This is serious.

260
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
This is serious.

261
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Come on, let's start.

262
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Let's go with this.

263
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What the hell?

264
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What's going on?

265
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
That idiot!

266
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Cut!

267
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Please don't say that.

268
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
We're doing this for business.

269
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yes.

270
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's not that kind of condition.

271
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Please do something about it.

272
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Please.

273
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Please do something about it.

274
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Please.

275
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I understand that you're worried, but

276
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Please, please.

277
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Hey, someone is behind you.

278
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It looks like it.

279
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Do your best! Do your best!

280
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Do your best! Do your best!

281
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What are you doing?

282
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Please help me!

283
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Go home.

284
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Don't you know what you're doing?

285
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You're in the way. Go home.

286
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Oshima, go home.

287
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You should go home.

288
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Go home.

289
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Please take care of me.

290
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Go home.

291
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You're in the way. Go home.

292
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Don't laugh.

293
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Matsumoto.

294
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You're a hacker.

295
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You're not a hacker.

296
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's a drama.

297
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Drama!

298
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Cut!

299
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Okay, okay.

300
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's over.

301
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's over.

302
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What are we going to do?

303
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Let's go! Let's go! Let's chase after them!

304
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
What are you doing?

305
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
What a great vitality.

306
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You're doing it.

307
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I don't know.

308
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I wonder if he's a drug addict.

309
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I wonder if he's at work.

310
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
There he is.

311
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
He's got a little bit of a thrill.

312
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Hamada-san, by the way,

313
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I've heard that you like girls who have protruding eyes, like fox eyes.

314
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I've heard that.

315
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
He wrote that on Mausoleum Yoshimoto.

316
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I think I've heard that.

317
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
He wrote that.

318
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I don't know but if you wear a stocking and put on a parachute and get blown by the wind...

319
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Then you'd be able to go fishing.

320
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
If you were in that situation...

321
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Even if you say that, there's no way there's a huge fan.

322
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You're right.

323
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
A huge fan!

324
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm wearing one!

325
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I can do it!

326
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'll go!

327
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You're amazing!

328
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Stop it!

329
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Are you okay? I don't know anymore.

330
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's really starting.

331
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Can I start around here?

332
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yes.

333
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
There should be more.

334
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Search for it.

335
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Search for everything.

336
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Somehow.

337
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's a failure.

338
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Ah, it's coming!

339
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Yes, I'm sorry.

340
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Ah!

341
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Who did this?

342
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
That's scary!

343
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

344
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
What's wrong, what's wrong?

345
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,500
Please date with him!

346
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,500
I'm telling you to go home.

347
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,500
Please take it.

348
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,500
What's the point? Go home.

349
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,500
Go home.

350
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,500
I told you to go home, but you still said that.

351
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,500
What's this?

352
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,500
This is not what we were talking about.

353
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,500
What should we do?

354
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,500
So, should we really stop?

355
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,500
Really?

356
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,500
Right?

357
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,500
Right?

358
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,500
Should we give up?

359
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,500
I can't give up.

360
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,500
This love is impossible.

361
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,500
This love is impossible!

362
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,500
Hanagata-san has moved!

363
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,500
Please hurry!

364
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,500
I'm busy!

365
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
Stop it!

366
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Stop it!

367
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,500
You're a stalker!

368
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,500
I can't give up!

369
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,500
You're a total fool!

370
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,500
You know it!

371
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:38,500
He's not Hamada's type. He's S.

372
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,500
He's the type that bullies women.

373
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,500
That's good.

374
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,500
Really?

375
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,500
He even uses water to...

376
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
What's that?

377
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,500
He's not a bad guy.

378
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,500
Can he do that?

379
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,500
He can do it.

380
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,500
Really?

381
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:00,500
Really? But if he tries to do that, he'll get hit by a rato.

382
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,500
You're being drenched in water with a rat.

383
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,500
That's what it is.

384
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,500
It's a special story.

385
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,500
It's impossible.

386
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,500
It's impossible.

387
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,500
There's no water or rats.

388
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,500
It's no good.

389
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,500
That's right.

390
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,500
That's why I'm saying it.

391
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,500
Wah!

392
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,500
A rat!

393
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,500
It's stuck!

394
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,500
It's stuck really well.

395
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,500
Even the water pump!

396
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,500
Huh?

397
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,500
Hey, hey!

398
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,500
Maybe your destiny is to become the king.

399
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,500
I'm going to go.

400
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,500
Hey, are you going?

401
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,500
Kame! Kame!

402
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,500
Why do you always do it when it's the real thing?

403
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,500
This is a very serious scene.

404
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
It's a scene like that.

405
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,500
What are you doing?

406
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
He's really something.

407
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,500
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

408
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,500
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

409
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,500
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

410
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,500
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

411
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,500
I understand how you feel, but I don't understand how you feel.

412
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
I don't understand how you feel.

413
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,500
Please, let me go.

414
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,500
Don't get in the way.

415
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,500
No, no, no, no, no, no.

416
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,500
Run away, Oshima!

417
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,500
Run away, Oshima!

418
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,500
Run away, Oshima!

419
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,500
Run away, Oshima!

420
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,500
Run away, Oshima!

421
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,500
You guys are overreacting!

422
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,500
We won't let you get close to the scene.

423
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,500
We promise.

424
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,500
We don't have any drama that we don't care about.

425
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,500
That's right.

426
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,500
We don't care about the drama.

427
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,500
That's right.

428
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,500
We don't care about the drama.

429
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,500
Please.

430
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500
Okay.

431
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,500
I'm sorry.

432
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,500
Really.

433
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,500
Yes.

434
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,500
You gave up.

435
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,500
It's not about giving up.

436
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:36,500
If you listen to him, you'll see what he's like. He's a wreck.

437
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,500
Nobuko, what are you doing?

438
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,500
Nobuko!

439
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,500
This is a bowling alley.

440
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,500
What are you going to do?

441
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
It's your job.

442
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,500
Let's give up.

443
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,500
Wait!

444
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
Bowling!

445
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
I'm serious.

446
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,500
I'm coming.

447
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,500
What are you going to do?

448
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,500
But, you know, you're bowling, right?

449
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,500
I'm talking about now.

450
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,000
Yes.

451
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,500
Hamada-san loves to get strikes.

452
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,000
Really?

453
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,500
Really.

454
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,500
Really?

455
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,500
But, you know, it's the same thing.

456
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,500
It's the same thing.

457
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
It's convenient like this.

458
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,500
It's convenient like this.

459
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,500
In the bowling alley.

460
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,500
You just need to get a strike.

461
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
Well, I'm sorry.

462
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,000
Hang in there.

463
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,500
You can do it.

464
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,000
You can do it.

465
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,500
Stop it.

466
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:28,500
It's not real.

467
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,500
If it's not real, he will be in trouble.

468
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,500
Alright! I'll strike a little.

469
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,500
Okay!

470
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,500
Alright!

471
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,500
Let's go!

472
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,500
Alright! Let's go!

473
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,500
Go! Go! Go!

474
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,500
Hey!

475
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:58,500
Hey!

476
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,500
Hey!

477
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,500
Please go out with me!

478
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,500
Hey!

479
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,500
Hey!

480
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,500
Hey!

481
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,500
Hey!

482
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,500
Hey!

483
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,500
Hey!

484
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,500
Hey!

485
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,500
Hey!

486
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,500
Hey!

487
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Hey!

488
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,500
No, no, no!

489
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Mr. Hamada, Mr. Hamada!

490
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
Please, please!

491
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,500
Please, please!

492
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,500
Mr. Hamada, what are you thinking?

493
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,500
Please, please!

494
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,500
Please, please!

495
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,500
Mr. Hamada!

496
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
Please, please!

497
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,500
What? Was it this kind of character?

498
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,500
You woke him up, Mr. Hamada!

499
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,500
You shouldn't have woken him up!

500
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,500
Sorry, I was just standing there.

501
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,500
You were just standing there.

502
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,500
I don't know, really.

503
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,500
Shut up!

504
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,500
Sorry.

505
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,500
Come here.

506
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,500
I'm sorry.

507
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,500
I'm sorry.

508
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,500
Let's go.

509
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,500
I told you.

510
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,500
Jeez.

511
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,500
I told you.

512
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,500
I knew it.

513
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,500
Next time.

514
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,500
Wow, amazing.

515
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,500
What the hell.

516
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,500
Hey.

517
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,500
What the hell.

518
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,500
I can't hear you at all!

519
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,500
Hey!

520
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,500
What are you doing?

521
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,500
Robocon, let me go!

522
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,500
Robocon!

523
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,500
Let me go!

524
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,500
Robocon!

525
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,500
Are you okay?

526
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
Let me go!

527
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,500
Let me go!

528
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Let me go!

529
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,500
It's okay to be like that.

530
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,500
Take it easy.

531
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,500
What the hell!

532
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,500
Don't do that.

533
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,500
I'm going.

534
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,500
I'm going.

535
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,500
I don't know what to do.

536
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,500
Is he okay?

537
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,500
The way he walks is a bit...

538
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:49,500
Next time, if you go to a golf scene, you'll see how much you'll be looked down on by the club.

539
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,500
Yeah, this time it's scary.

540
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,500
It's scary, so let's really stop.

541
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,500
Let's really stop.

542
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,500
However!

543
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,500
I was wondering why he wouldn't accept it so much.

544
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:05,500
He likes short-cut girls.

545
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,500
Short-cut?

546
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,500
Isn't that enough?

547
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,500
That's more than enough.

548
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,500
I think that's enough.

549
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,500
I think that's impossible.

550
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,500
You can't do three shots in a row.

551
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,500
That's impossible.

552
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,500
It's not possible.

553
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,500
I think it's better to go home.

554
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,500
What?

555
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:21,080
That's the

556
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,500
golf club.

557
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,500
They are playing golf.

558
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,500
What?

559
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
Oh, really?

560
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,500
Oh, really?

561
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,500
It's stuck, Oshima!

562
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,500
It's stuck!

563
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,500
It's stuck!

564
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,500
Hey, hey, hey!

565
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,500
Go and tell him!

566
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,500
Hey, hey, hey!

567
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,500
What are you doing?

568
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,500
I ran over there.

569
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,500
Yeah.

570
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,500
What should I do?

571
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,500
I wonder if it's okay.

572
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,500
Then, I'll go back to my original position.

573
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,500
Yeah, go back to your original position.

574
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,500
Yeah, go back to your original position.

575
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,500
Let's go.

576
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,500
I'm ready.

577
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,500
Hey!

578
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,500
Hit!

579
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,500
Please, please, please!

580
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,500
Please!

581
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,500
Please!

582
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,500
Please!

583
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,500
Please!

584
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,500
Stop it!

585
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,500
You said you can't do it anymore!

586
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,500
Please!

587
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,500
Please!

588
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,500
Sliiidee!

589
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,500
Sliiidee!

590
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,500
Please!

591
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,500
Ah!

592
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,500
Sliiidee!

593
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500
Sliiidee!

594
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:37,500
Slippery, slippery, slippery, slippery.

595
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,500
What are you doing?

596
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,500
I hate you!

597
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
Ouch!

598
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,500
Robocon! Robocon!

599
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,500
Help me, Robocon!

600
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,500
Stop it.

601
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:59,500
Hey!

602
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,500
You guys are so annoying.

603
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,500
I don't know. I don't know.

604
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,500
I don't know.

605
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,500
I don't know.

606
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,500
Why?

607
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,500
You are so stupid.

608
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,500
You like this kind of thing, don't you?

609
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,500
I told you. I told you.

610
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,500
Hey, you.

611
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,500
I told you.

612
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,500
I like this kind of thing.

613
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,500
Here is your present.

614
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,500
What are you doing?

615
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,500
What are you doing?

616
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,500
You!

617
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,500
You!

618
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,500
You!

619
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
You!

620
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,500
You!

621
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,500
You!

622
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,500
You!

623
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,500
Get out of here!

624
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,500
I don't think this is enough!

625
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,500
You!

626
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,500
I'll come back!

627
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,500
You!

628
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,500
Get out of here!

629
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,500
You bastard!

630
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,500
You bastard!

631
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,500
You bastard!

632
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,500
I'm sorry.

633
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,500
I don't know what to do.

634
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,500
You couldn't stop him?

635
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,500
I think he'll come next week.

636
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,500
What?

637
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,500
Are you serious?

638
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,500
Seriously?
